"""bad ground and customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta repeatedly has bad ground and customer service staff. The breaking point which compelled me to write a feedback on this airline after flying with them for so many years came when they did not handle my luggage professionally. When there was damages found on the bags, the ground agents denied liabilities and accuse the fault was on passengers. The same was true to other passengers who experienced the same problem on the same flight when in Singapore from the US via Tokyo. After filing complaint to the customer service, the customer service took more than 14 days to reply (when in their auto reply email stated they would reply within 14 days) and the customer service would defend their mistakes and continue laying blame on the passengers. I have been their top level frequent fliers but I never felt I was treated like one at all. They don't offer any preferential check in, retrieval of luggage bags above their usual sky priority which a simple comfort + would earn the similar treatment while being the top frequent fliers on other alliance group or airlines would have offered 1st class service than Delta offering merely the same like comfort +. Service recovery is bad. The staff are not trained or geared towards high value customers at all. Having a Porsche for tight connection is nothing premium when other airlines offer direct boarding from lounge like Emirates or complimentary limousine airport transfers such as from JL, MH and so on. They appear to prefer paid business class passengers but their products and services completely do NOT match up to any full service airlines that have business class product. Their lounge is always filled with so many people and refreshment are really just plain refreshment (basic snacks NOT food) and very often, their lounges do NOT even have shower facilities. So don't even count on having complimentary spa/massage/sleeping area etc. Their planes are dirty and old yet the ticket fares are expensive. Amenities frequently not working for example IFE doesn't work, USB not charging, food stuck in between seats, chewing gums found in aircraft safety menu, dirty toilets, broken window shades and Delta has a policy where instead of bumping revenue passengers to higher classes when seats are needed, they would instead bump their non revenue employees or families/kins onto business class seats especially on international route. Their complimentary first class upgrade almost hardly happen to any members as it will always be full. Delta will always try not to offer the upgrade until at boarding and by which time, all the first class seats would be taken up already. So don't be fooled by the benefits stated on their website for their frequent fliers programme. Their hidden clause to defend their misrepresentation would be ""whenever available"". To Delta, available for revenue tickets doesn't mean available for upgrade. There is absolutely no incentives being their frequent fliers especially for international travellers. They are just a commuter airline within US or regional at best. So Delta best if ever rated best is best within the US only. In one word to describe Delta and by International Standard, avoid it. Its better to take your money to other airlines who would respect and treat premium or frequent fliers more seriously."
"""treat economy customers like trash""","Not Verified | Dallas to Atlanta. I have been a faithful Delta customer for many years, flying about 1x a month. They have fair reliability. They treat economy customers like trash. I have over 140k in miles but get zero upgrades or assistance. Several times I have not received snacks or drinks because I am in the back of the plane."
"""Bad experience with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Buffalo to Los Angeles. Bad experience with Delta, for a strange reason, was my baggage to heavy (3 kg) this is strange because on the KLM flight the weight of my baggage was not too heavy. I must pay $100 extra for my baggage so the total amount for 3 pieces of baggage was $190.00. Never Delta airlines for me."
"""Great customer service""","Not Verified | Mexico City to Los Angeles. Great customer service. Staff was honest and helpful with any assistance we needed. I would recommend the Delta service in Mexico City"
"""crew made it an amazing journey""","✅ Trip Verified | Newark to Munich. We had connecting flights both departing and returning back to New Jersey from Munich. Everything ran smoothly. We did have to retrieve our baggage on our return flight because of international customs but Delta had an place in the Detroit departure area to drop off luggage and forward them to Newark. It was effortless. The flight attendants made the time on both flights remarkably comfortable. Blankets and pillows were available. They were attentive to our needs. Warm moist cloths were given before our 2 meals to freshen up. Beverages were served several times and cups of water offered frequently. Snacks were served and offered when we wanted, the flight attendants seemed to truly enjoy their job. The captains let us know what was going on especially when we had a weather delay flying back to Newark. It was nice to hear why we were being held back from landing and for how long instead of wondering what was happening or how long we would be circling. We will not hesitate to choose Delta/KLM in the future. As stressful as flying can be the Delta crew made it an amazing journey."
"""comfort level was top notch""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Kona. I was so pleased with my flight and this was my first time flying so I had all the jitters. The staff was amazing, comfort level was top notch. They had pillows and blankets and little televisions in the seats and you can track your flight. The pilot kept us updated. I literally will only fly Delta from now on. On our way home we flew Alaska and I was extremely upset that it was such a downgrade. I was shivering and freezing cold the entire flight as was my son and husband and we were in long sleeves and pants. No pillows, no blankets, you had to pay to use the tablets, staff were snotty. Thank you Delta for the good experience."
"""too frustrating""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Frankfurt. I have decided to fly with another airline going forward just because my overall experience with Delta is simply too frustrating. I was also pretty unhappy with the unreasonable 1st checked baggage fee. Also my not being able to choose my seat during check-in. And when I asked the agent to change it for me in Frankfurt he simply had no interest in helping me. Food was also unsatisfactory. My opinion at this point is that Delta is simply not worth the headache. FYI: the changes Delta has made are clearly not geared toward passenger satisfaction."
"""Thanks for nothing""","✅ Trip Verified | Louisville to Newport News via Atlanta. The flight was delayed a pretty long time resulting in me missing my flight. We flew into Atlanta where the staff was so terrible I know I will never use you guys again. She was rude and very unprofessional. I just don’t understand how you guys don’t coordinate with late flights to make sure we make our flight. This resulting in a delay of the mission. Thanks for nothing."
"""delayed because of the weather""","✅ Trip Verified | Kansas City to San Jose via Atlanta. Ok Delta. Today you did us wrong and caused us to miss the flight. Let the connecting flight leave early without 8 passengers knowing we were delayed because of the weather. 7 hrs and $350 dollars later because of you. Not happy. Hate Delta. Wifi on the plane doesn't work and this airport is not hearing impaired friendly. Do not use Delta."
"""not book flight with Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | We were in flight delayed, forced to circle terminal for more than 20 minutes, which put us arriving close to our next departure. Then they changed our terminal to the furthest terminal to have to run and catch our plane to Costa Rica. Never mind the people who didn't listen to the announcement of please sit if you do not have a connecting flight in less than an hour. Now we are out 8 hours of our destination and 200 dollars to have to taxi from another town we are flying into. I will not book flight with Delta again. Especially since they did everything they could to delay our landing."
"""each flight gets worse and worse""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Las Vegas. The process to get to the gate is slow and stupid. It seems they could do it more efficiently but would rather annoy everyone. There’s never enough room to put your carry on because they don’t enforce carry on size. One suitcase will fill an overhead bin where three carry ons should go. I had to sit with my legs crossed in my seat for my whole flight - very uncomfortable. The staff on the flight is not courteous or helpful. And who thinks some wheat cheezits are good? Very disappointed. It’s like each flight gets worse and worse. It’s almost worth taking your chances of getting pulled out of your seat and just going with another airline."
"""very good airline to fly""","Not Verified | Delta is a very good airline to fly on. we flew from Jacksonville to Atlanta. the plane was old, but had new IFE monitors. The staff on the plane and on the ground were very nice. I am looking forward to fly with Delta again."
"""What a great team""","Not Verified | Mobile to Raleigh. My son was sick and unable to make the flight so I called Delta customer service and they were just the best. Did a refund for his ticket without any hassle of any kind. What a great team you have that treated us like real customers in all areas of your business. Will fly Delta only now."
"""Unbelievable Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Washington Dulles to Atlanta. I arrived to the airport ahead of schedule about 1 to go thru processing & enough time for my flight. The plane arrived, the passengers got off & we started boarding the plane about 4:45. While sitting for about 30 minutes the stated they was looking into some things & would update shortly. It was after 7 before they came advising we had to get off the plane, it couldn't fly because of navigation that our flight would leave at 9. While sitting & waiting the pilot comes on to say sorry folks I can't fly you out at 9 that he would reach his 20 hours so trying to round up a crew to fly out at 1:20. Everyone all upset so they start putting people in hotels & getting a taxi. The guy in front of me got the last room available so only other recourse would be pay out of pocket ourselves. I advised that I had an event that morning in Bryon at 11am was there any other flights so I was eventually able to grab a standby. My ticket says wheelchair assistance because I cant do all of the walking in the airport due to disability. So I get to Atlanta airport no wheelchair & to top things off my baggage with all my things I needed was no where to be found. I fill out a baggage claim. Saturday evening my baggage was delivered. I submit a complaint online thru Delta to get a response by email saying they was sorry & unfortunately couldn't assist. My thought process is after everything I had been thru for an airline to not think enough to at least pick up the phone to call your customer was just as bad as the entire experience on Friday. Unbelievable Delta, really unbelievable! Not to mention the entire time sitting on the plane did you offer crackers or juice will everyone sitting there cramped up & uncomfortable."
"""got different seats than booked""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Detroit, 26 September 2019 Premium Select. Check-in on line impossible, stating that a change had occurred and that I was allowed to amend my flight at no extra cost. Not a real option as the rest of the trip had already been booked and partially paid for. Arriving at the check-in counter at Amsterdam Airport we got different seats than booked. Explanation: Delta had flown in with a different aircraft. But we were assured that we would nonetheless have Comfort Plus seats being ‘the equivalent of Premium Select’. This is, of course, not the case: The difference between Comfort Plus and Premium Select is 4 inches of legroom less, no leg support and no 7 degrees more reclining seats; a smaller screen and no personalized service etc. Features reflected in the price difference. The big blow, however, came inside the plane. One can try to call any seat a Comfort Plus seat, but not a main cabin seat with 9 instead of 8 abreast. Also, dinner came on the same tray and with the same quality as the rest of the cabin, The menu circulated in advance was clearly marked ‘International Main Cabin’. Checking the safety instructions in the seat pocket, it turned out that the plane in question was a Boeing 777-200 in a configuration not available on Delta’s web site. Probably an older version, because my table was hanging toward me, making my food tray almost landing on my lap. What I reproach Delta most of all is that they were not straightforward. A plane replacement might happen. In that case it would have been correct to let Premium Select passengers know, with excuses and an offer to compensate for the inconvenience. This has not happened."
"""she hears the military excuse""","Not Verified | My flight coming into ATL was delayed by 20 minutes and had 25 minutes until my next flight left for Fayetteville. I was so worried I wouldn't make it but the flight attendant on the flight coming into Atlanta assured me they would wait for me, but I still ran my heart out to the next gate. They had just called for last boarding call and the plane was still there. I explained i had no baggage and am military and really needed to board three plane. It was 2124 and the plane was scheduled to depart at 2131. The lady told me she hears the ""military excuse"" but there's nothing to be done. I understand there is a schedule but this was the last flight into Fayetteville. Every other airline, like southwest, will hold the plane for a small amount of time for passengers with small delays. Delta ruined my chance of getting home before work and I will rethink flying with them again. I want a company that supports thir passengers, especially when that company is the cause of the delay."
"""Don’t ever trust your luggage""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Fargo. Don’t ever trust your luggage in the hands of this incompetent company. My wife and I purchased a brand new away bag since our old luggage had seen its better days. We bring it with us for the first time and while checking our bag the lady behind the counter literally threw our luggage and bounced it off the wall and onto the conveyor belt. We mention that was rude and she apologizes. Then we get to our destination and our bag isn’t there to greet us. Great. Glad that’s the second time in a row we have been without our luggage in 2 trips. Delta batting 1000 right there. Fast forward 2 days we get our bag to the airport and the baggage guy in Phoenix is a little more careful with our bag but not much. We get home finally and our zipper is destroyed, our name tag is completely ripped and the new bag is scratched. Naturally, we decide to speak to a Delta representative at this point and he informs me it’s minor damage and that it’s probably not worth my time to make a claim since Delta surely won’t do anything about it anyways. Forget Delta."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo to Baltimore via Minneapolis. I will never fly Delta again after what I went through here in Tokyo. Understandably they canceled flights for Saturday October 12th due to a typhoon, but our flight was the following afternoon - all Delta flights on Sunday and Monday are canceled despite the fact that the typhoon has passed by Sunday morning and the majority of other airlines are flying this afternoon and tomorrow. Instead of compensating us for the extra 3 days we are stranded in Tokyo or adding additional flights they are absolving themselves of any blame and forcing their customers to pay over $500 out of pocket for the multiple days we are stranded in Japan. You’re a multi billion dollar corporation and you can’t even offer your customers some kind of compensation when you made a mistake and canceled flights far too early? It’s disappointing but enlightening because it showed me the type of airline you are and you’ll never get another dollar from me."
"""worst airline I have ever travelled""","Not Verified | Detroit to Fort Lauderdale. Delta is by far the worst airline I have ever travelled with. They do not care about their passengers. The workers have 0 idea anything about the planes or the flight. cannot express how bad they are. nobody should fly them."
"never put your faith in this company""","✅ Trip Verified | Portland to Bloomington via Atlanta. My flight landed at 830pm at ATL so I could hit a connecting flight at 9:07. We weren't able to unload because another plane was at the gate we were suppose to pull into. Instead of pulling into a different gate, we sat there for 20 minutes. We finally got to a gate and it wasn't until 9PM that the first person was able to get off the flight. They promised that nobody would miss their connecting flights. Turns out they did not do anything to prevent this. My flight to BMI took off at 9:02PM (suppose to be 9:07PM). I got to the gate at 9:09PM with no plane in sight. There were countless other people who had missed flights due to this airline. The best part was it was a gorgeous day out so it was really just their lack of commitment, maintenance, and planning by the airport. I wish I could create a work environment where I just have to say, ""I'm sorry for not being able to achieve what I said would happen but here are the reasons"". I ended up sleeping at the airport as I imagined I'd get less than 8 hours of sleep if I went to their ""discounted"" hotel (not free), go through security at a big airport, and weave my way around of a mass amount of people to get to my gate. Summary is I missed my grandma's funereal because a company can't uphold it's scheduling. The good news is they got me there eventually, got me a ticket to the next flight, and I was able to see my family. Please never put your faith in this company. Always make sure there's another flight after and if there is, understand that you still might not get onto that flight because it was all already booked. Always look at the airport's policy on missed flights. You'll be amazed at what they can get away with when compared to EU flights."
"""Worst airline with flexibility""","Not Verified | Worst airline with flexibility on changing flight times if you purchased a basic economy ticket and worst customer service too. I fly a lot for my job and will never fly Delta again. I ended up getting a work meeting during my PTO and had to get back to Boston earlier than my previous ticket was for. They told me I had to buy a whole other ticket ($200). I couldn’t take the meeting from the airport because my computer died and I needed my charger which I left at home on accident, besides I didn’t think I would need it. I was already having a bad day and Delta made it worse with their bad customer service. They told me that purchasing another ticket was all I could do, but then after pleading with the customer service rep they told me I could stand on standby and pay an additional fee if there were additional seats on the plane. If they said that first, this all could have been avoided. $75 charge for stand-buy, on my top of the $170 ticket."
"""This flight was very good""","✅ Trip Verified | We found a great deal from LaGuardia to Rome via Atlanta on Delta and could not pass up the opportunity. This flight was very good. The IFE on the plane was great, with lots of selection and high quality. Flight Attendants handed out earbuds to use for the screens and the plane was in good condition. A blanket and pillow were provided as well. We ordered the kosher meal and everything tasted good. The cabin crew were very nice and service was quick. I recommend Delta for long haul."
"""food was actually very good""","Not Verified | Flew from Idaho to Amsterdam via Seattle. Small jet out of Boise, Emberer. Short flight all on time no issues at check in. Seattle to Amsterdam, check in fine, was in Premium Economy. Boarding went fine, seat was ok (got a few hours of sleep). Seatback entertainment was good. Service, food was actually very good. Snack was typical Delta cookies, which are great. Dinner was a chicken dish which was tasty, sandwich snack (turkey if I remember) was ok. Breakfast was a pastry and yogurt. All were good no issues at all. Flight Attendants while available were not very friendly. One kind of scowled most of the flight. Other than that all was good"
"""darkness of failure""","Not Verified | Paris to San Francisco. Flights are always great with this company. So far, so good. But I recently have been really disappointed. I had to cancel a flight, I sent one ticket to the support because the cancellation process didn't work on their website and app. I didn't receive a word back from them. Right now, It's my fourth ticket and I swear that I'll never ever take this airline again. Customer Service is really important in a company. If you don't get that, you embrace the darkness of failure."
"""the temperature set too low""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to New York. The red eye flight was late, full, and the captain apologized that the WiFi was not working. Just as well as I slept most of the time. One really annoying thing in the cabin was that the temperature set too low and even though I had a blanket I was cold. Normally, I tend to get hot on a plane and it was one of the few times I got cold. Fortunately, I had a sweater for this kind of situations and I got to sleep without freezing. The plane landed on time. I cannot comment on IFE or food as i did not get to view and eat them respectively. I think I do remember is that the flight attendants were ok, not being rude or disinterested. Based on some of the other reviews I am thinking the crew was a more professional than normal. But, then this is the first time flying on Delta."
"""experience was better than I expected""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Seattle. Lining up to get checked in at one of the economy counters, the Delta worker told us to go to the premium check-in counters on the other side which had far fewer people. The lady at the counter processed us quickly and we were making our way to the security line. So, that was a good start to our journey back to Seattle. The flight left on time and as it departed late afternoon, I got to eat a meal on Delta and it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It was average quality airline food. The IFE was reasonable for a domestic route. The typical reviews I read of US-based airlines mention how terrible the flight attendants are. However, the flight crew on this flight was professional and courteous. So, I thought I was fortunate to get a good crew. Upon reading little more on the US based airlines, it seems Delta has a better operation and more motivated workforce than American or United. Well, I hope they keep improving as all of them have a long way to go to compete effectively with many of the Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. If it wasn't for the US government protecting the domestic market for these carriers from their overseas competitors, they would have stopped operating long time before they went through their multi-year bankruptcy. Sorry, I am digressing from the flight experience. Overall, I enjoyed the flight back to Seattle and the experience was better than I expected. So, I was content that it was uneventful, landed on time, and I didn't lose my luggage."
"""extremely slow, uncooperative, and rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Just thought I'd share my frustrating experience. I was on my way to an important out of state interview and I had a very narrow time gap to shoot, so I thought I'd choose Delta to be safe because I was under the impression they were more reliable. There was a lay over in LAX. We landed on time but proceeded to sit for an hour and a half on the runway due to construction. We sat there so long that our connecting flight left without us. There were at least 5 other passengers on the flight scheduled for the same connecting flight to Columbus. By the time we got off the plane we had 20 min to get across the airport to make our flight. We told all the Delta employees on our flight and at the arrival gate to communicate to the other gate that we were coming. One other passenger even called in to Delta. We got there 5 min before the actual departure time, and they hadn’t held the plane. They left without all of us! The departing gate employees claimed they never received any kind of info from the other gate. Finally we were forced to get rebooked for another flight, the service desk ladies were extremely slow, uncooperative, and rude. The soonest Delta could get us to our destination was 6 hours after our initial scheduled arrival. The service was terrible. No one was helpful. No vouchers were offered or any kind of effort to make things better. We almost missed the back up plan flights because they took so long to get our flights changed."
"""Not for Business travel""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Toronto. Not for Business travel. I booked First Class tickets expecting to use their lounge at the airport when I arrived early to get some work done in a quiet environment. Access is reserved for trans continental flights only, no Domestic or Canada/USA access, but if you have an USA based American Express card you can have access. As a Canadian I cannot have a USA based American Express card so It is not possible to ever have access to their lounges for USA/Canada travel. Won’t be using Delta again, they do not cater to the business traveller."
"""under the age of 10 should be sat with parents""","✅ Trip Verified | Montego Bay to Indianapolis via Atlanta. After running from an international gate to a domestic flight, we arrived with minutes to spare to board our flight home. Children under the age of 10 should be sat with parents. Passengers should not have to negotiate and beg other rude passengers to switch seats with them. After spending $800+ on international travel I shouldn’t also have to do the job of a flight attendant just to sit next to my 7 and 8 year olds. Done with Delta."
"""very friendly and professional""","Not Verified | Yesterday I had the pleasure of flying on Delta Flight # 1104 from Atlanta, GA back home to Key West, FL. Unfortunately I didn't think to get names but the crew, Captain and attendants were awesome. I was particularly impressed by the fact they all smiled throughout the flight. They were very friendly and professional."
"""such a good economy trip""","Not Verified | Amsterdam to New Orleans via Detroit. Flight DL0133 September 22nd. Traveling for business. Top flight. Crew happy and friendly and attentive. Used humour and asked about special birthdays and anniversaries : nice touch. Aircraft clean and comfortable. Even Economy was good legroom and tv and USB port Turbulent trip but good and continuous outline by captain and crew. Meal was really good. Has been a long time since I had such a good economy trip. Will definitely use Delta again! Thanks to the crew."
"""haven't come across such rudeness""","✅ Trip Verified | During my flight from Detroit to Greensboro the flight attendant asked if an Asian married couple (sitting in front of me) could perform the duties of someone sitting at the exit window. The man said yes but his wife had broken English so the flight attendant asked again attempting to engage her in a conversation. Where was she going she asked the wife when the husband answered for his wife the attendant said rudely ""I wasn't talking to you I was talking to her"". I was shocked, intimidated and embarrassed for this Couple by her response. I still feel furious of how the couple was treated. I fly a lot to Greensboro and other places and haven't come across such rudeness by any of the airlines."
"""quite satisfied with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Sacramento to Denver via Seattle. I was quite satisfied with Delta, especially during my return trip. Even though I flew the Basic Economy, they put me in decent seats. The seats were not the most comfortable, but the legroom wasn’t terrible. The onboard entertainment was wonderful with a decent variety of shows and movies. Both ground service and flight attendants were all friendly. The SEA to DEN flight did the standard drink service, but also came around two additional times: one for coffee and one for water. Overall, I was satisfied with their service and amenities. I will consider Delta for future trips."
"""These flights were all great""","✅ Trip Verified | This review applies to three flights Honolulu Los Angeles on a Boeing 767. Los Angeles to Boston round trip Delta One Boeing 757. All 3 experiences were great. Honolulu LA was an internationally configured 767 so the seat was amazing The food was perfectly good above average domestic first class. LA to Boston round trip was an internationally configured 757 with Delta One service. While the layout on the 767 allowed for me to sit alone, the food etc was not quite as good as the Delta One flights. The Delta One 757 offered very comfortable 2x2 seating with upgraded service such as amenity kits..etc. On all flights the attendants were friendly and terrific, the entertainment plentiful and the experiences were all excellent. Delta One is a gigantic step up from Delta first domestic which can feel very cramped. These flights were all great."
"""cannot believe the lack of customer support""","✅ Trip Verified | I am beyond shocked at how disappointed I am in my experience(s) with my recent Delta flights. I have tried calling the corporate line 3 times and no answer. I sent them a complaint requesting a call back, nothing. So now I’ll share my experience with everyone I can. Our flight returning home from Hawaii was delayed 5 hours by the time we took off. It didn’t leave until after 2am when all was said and done. We had no where to go as everything closes early in Kauai, extra expenses related to rental car late return, had more expenses due to staying longer (food), had to try to make arrangements for kids that were supposed to be dropped off at our house by a certain time, and most importantly wasted my time and caused a lot of unneeded stress. I think of experiences I have had with companies in the past and this one far surpasses any negative experience I have had in the past. I called when we realized it was delayed, which was further delayed once more. I got a CS person that really was not helpful at all. They offered $100 for my troubles. I asked for a manager and he told me that is all they could do. Got the manager and she mentioned they might be able to do a bit more and never recorded the call or offer. I was so frustrated that my friends I was traveling with decided to call as I was getting really frustrated. My screen did not work on the way to Hawaii. My wife’s screen did not work on the way back. I cannot believe the lack of customer support. Any business I can think of that I have had a negative experience with has tried to rectify the negative experience. I feel you have to beg for help with Delta. I personally feel Delta does not care about its customers. A follow up call or apology coming from Delta would have been highly appropriate. Frankly if I had this type of experience at my business we’d bend over backwards to make it right. Delta has not done squat! I think they figure they’re big enough it really doesn’t matter. Hopefully my feedback online everywhere I can think of will make a difference? Highly unlikely I think!"
"""always fly with Delta""","Not Verified | New York to Seattle. This flight was the best Delta flight I have been on, we left from JFK at around 7:40am (on time) and as soon as I stepped on the 757 the FA greeted me with a big smile and a warm welcome. I was wearing my Boeing T-Shirt and the FA's noticed and asked me if I wanted to go into the cockpit, I did. Just after take-off all of the passengers in premium and economy got complimentary breakfast, the sausage was a little cold but the scrambled eggs were great. About 50 minutes before landing into Seattle, me and the FO started talking in the front galley about planes and general aviation, it was great. The landing into Seattle was perfect, definitely buttered the bread. I will always fly with Delta."
"""terrible customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Las Vegas to Atlanta (DL1523), September 18th. The worst experience I have had on a flight ever. We came 3 hours early and was forced to check in our carry on bags as some other passengers used our storage. The seat I was given had a broken seat belt and I was not checked on so at all so that was a safety hazard. The nightmare started when the flight was delayed. They were boarding groups 1 and 2 but a bunch of people who were from group 3 cut in and nobody checked. Our group followed the rules by waiting for the group we were assigned and it was a big mistake! All the storage was taken so we were forced to check our carry on bags. Staff were also very unorganized, unprofessional and never apologized. One of them at the front desk told me ""you can wait for another later flight but it was already 11pm"" when I had commented about our situation which was rude and made the situation worse. Then when we sat my seat belt was broken and no one checked. Then the flight attendant completely skipped our row for drinks and ignored us. After an hour of waiting and being patient for the hope that one flight attendant would notice my husband hit the button to calmly explain that we were skipped for drinks. We never received any apology for anyone and were treated as second class passengers. I always believed that Delta airlines had an exceptional reputation with excellent customer service but my opinion has now changed. Our experience after paying nearly $600 was not of an airline with high standards instead it felt like a cheap discount airline like Spirit or Frontier with terrible customer service. So sad and never again we will try to fly with you we will go with American or United the next time we travel."
"""frustrating process to get paid""","✅ Trip Verified | Paris to San Diego via Detroit. ""Corporate customer care"" is understaffed. Perhaps if they called it customer service, you would get some. After selling my seat, it took me a long, frustrating process to get paid. I avoid flying the American legacy carriers for a reason."
"""Customer service ridiculous""","Not Verified | Dallas Ft Worth to Atlanta. Customer service is ridiculous. First of all they lie and say the flight is full they cannot change my seat. How do you have people on standby and no seats available 30 minutes before a flight? Why didn't they tell me to wait and see if something comes up before they board their bystanders? The turbulence was awful."
"""When did Delta become such a bad company?""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Bogota via Atlanta. When did Delta Airlines become such a bad company? Checked in exactly 24 hours before my flights from FLL-ATL-BOG but only got one seat assignment. Called DL and they told me it was because I'd ""chosen"" a long connexion (their website offered it to me). I pointed out that in IATA area one a connexion is 12 hours so why did it not check me in for my connexion? No useful response. Was told to check-in again 24 hours before connexion flight. I did so and got a seat assignment but no boarding pass. Asked at counter at FLL and was told again it was due to long connexion time and that I should just check-in a fourth time at the gate. I did so and registered my dissatisfaction at having to check-in four times and this unpleasant woman said there was no reason why I shouldn't have been given a boarding pass in Atlanta when I asked for one. Delta advertised a dinner on the flight from ATL-BOG but it was a cold snack (turkey sandwich, two apple slices, and a small chunk of chocolate). To list this as a dinner flight you must serve a hot meal. This is false advertising. In-flight entertainment was good. The cabin crew never broke into a smile not even a ""Pan-Am Smile."" The flight was very cheap though so I guess I paid a Spirit Airlines fare so I got Spirit Airlines service. A note to US carriers: we Americans have bony bums so need a cushion to sit on -- your seats feel like you're sitting on a wooden board."
"""constant lying""","Not Verified | Cleveland to Minneapolis. Delta is a poor airline. I travel 30-40 times a year and have delays 30% of the time on Delta. What's annoying is the constant lying. Tell us you don't know rather than delay 5 times. It's all about the money as it's obvious customer satisfaction doesn't matter. I control about a million dollars in travel spend for my team who fly primarily on Delta. no more. I will no longer approve travel with Delta."
"""told there would be no refund""","Not Verified | About a week ago I decided to book a one-way flight with Delta out of Bismark to Minneapolis. Unfortunately, they were one of two airlines flying from there. Everything was going well and I purchased my ticket with a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee."" What is very misleading about this is that the airline does not specify which 24 hours these are. You can only get a refund within 24 hours of purchasing the ticket, not before the flight takes place. So with this assumption that the flight could be canceled and refunded as long as there was a 24 hour in advance notice, I booked the ticket. Unfortunately for me, issues arose I can no longer take this flight. I tried to cancel the flight online, which I did, trying to get my refund, which I didn't. I then tried to call and get my refund, only to be informed that there is a $200 fee for canceling my flight, and I would only get back what the ticket was worth minus that, a whopping $18 (which can only be used towards another flight). This is at two-plus months away from the flight, there is plenty of time for them to find a replacement for my seat. After sitting on hold for thirty minutes waiting for a representative, I was once again told there would be no refund, so I asked them to reinstate my ticket. There was no way I was going to allow this company to get double the profit off of my seat, I'd rather it stay empty. I then asked them if the ticket could be transferred to another person, so I could get someone to purchase the ticket from me. The answer is no. Not only that, but the representative on the phone sounded just as frustrated as I was. Lesson learned: I have to click two or three different links to learn what exactly what a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee"" is. On top of that, I should know not to trust what a big company shows at face value. Even if for some odd reason I would get the chance to take this flight, I wouldn't. I will never fly with Delta if I can avoid it. I wish I would have done my research in advance, or I would have seen all the bad reviews they had."
"""Delta changed our seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Amsterdam. I purchased my two tickets months in advance, paying extra for premium economy in the bulkhead seats. One day before my flight, Delta changed our seats so that we are no longer next to each other. They offered no recourse other than accepting less desirable seats in the middle of the plane, and no compensation for giving us a less desirable situation. Overall rating, based on this totally unacceptable change is a 0."
"""find them to be consistent in their service""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Detroit. Flown with Delta many times and I find them to be consistent in their service over time. It is not an extraordinary airline but a very decent one. The staff on the ground was mostly friendly and onboard very friendly. Decent meals, enough drinks, and very attentive staff. I particularly like the 767-300 for the 2-3-2 seat configuration. While it is an older plane (around 30 years old), the seat configuration has always been a plus. Would fly again."
"""never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | I had a flight from Portland to Phoenix via Seattle. They had no room on the flight for luggage, so they had me check my carryon. I asked the flight attendant, “can I get my carry on in SEA? I need my laptop.” She said, “absolutely! You can get it at the sky bridge with your ticket.” Then it’s time to connect and they overbooked the flight (per usual). I stay in Seattle because I have business here. so I ask them to go get the bag they promised me. Fiona at the counter was great and went to get my bag. She tells me I can pick it up at the baggage claim. I go there and find it in the company of the least friendly of all Delta employees. Finally, (I think) we’re reunited! Not so fast. The chick at the counter proceeds to tell me they are not allowed to short check bags and I cannot collect my bag. Naturally, she says this 2-3 times before I beg her to give me a solution. She tells me to proceed to ticketing so i can buy a new ticket to Seattle and collect my bag there. When I get to ticketing, I explain my story for the 3rd time. She explains that she needs to call global before permitting my bag return. So she calls global and insists I pay a fee to collect my bag. 45 minutes later and extra $$$ I have my carry on. Had any of the employees explained there may be an extra fee or a ridiculous process I may not have been so fuming mad. But they didn’t, nor did they have any compassion on my situation that was ultimately their problem. To be honest, I will go out of my way to never fly Delta again."
"""Very attentive crew""","✅ Trip Verified | LaGuardia to Chicago. Great flight. On time. Very attentive crew who were liberal with the drink pours. A pre-flight G&T is more than you get on most airlines. Lunch was a pad Thai salad that tasted great. All in all, very good."
"""We were incredibly disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Burlington via LaGuardia. We were incredibly disappointed with our Delta experience. On 9/2/19, we were scheduled to take DELTA 322 from Dallas to LaGuardia, our flight was delayed prior to take off but was supposed to arrive on time, however, we were rerouted to Norfolk right before landing in NYC. We eventually made it to LaGuardia but missed our connecting flight to BTV. The next flight out of LaGuardia was around 9:30pm on 9/3/19 which was not acceptable. We spoke to an agent who found a flight out of JFK (DELTA 5120) leaving at 12:15pm on 9/3/19. When we arrived at LaGuardia, we sought out a Delta representative and explained our situation, he gave us a “distressed passenger” voucher for a hotel. We called the number and the only hotel available was the Crown Plaza - we were required to pay $231.85 (which was apparently the discounted rate). We then had to spend $40 on transportation from LaGuardia to JFK at 1am. The receptionist at the Crown Plaza stated that she had never heard of an airline making customers pay for their hotel room due to airline error/delays. We were not the only customers flying with Delta at this hotel who has this issue. Not only did we incur nearly $300 of unexpected/unnecessary expenses but we also lost a day worth of work and animal care fees. We are absolutely unsatisfied with Delta and the way in which this was handled."
"""last time with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Beijing to Seattle. Delta is flying 15-year-old airliners. That sounds pretty old, and it is. Our seats felt like they had come out of someone's neglected car. On our China-bound flight, we were without the in-flight entertainment system for much of the flight. What was displayed was the ""rebooting"" routine. Once up and running, the entertainment consisted of a dozen, or so, uninteresting movies; along with some very brief documentaries. The music selection consisted of 30 minutes of your chosen genre. On a ten hour flight, 30 minutes of music is a pretty bad plan. On our return flight, ten days later, we were fortunate to have the entertainment up and running during most of the flight, but the entertainment was identical. Both my wife and I ended up watching the same film on both legs of the trip. Food is about as awful as I've seen on any airline. We knew enough to bring lots of our own food with us. Our ""comfort plus"" seating included meals that our boys didn't touch. Less than two hours into the return flight I very politely requested a few cartons of milk for our little ones, and learned that there were none. They apparently had only loaded twenty 4oz cartons of milk onto the plane to provide for 198 passengers for over 10 hours. I actually had three flight attendants show up at my seat to scold me, saying ""We're not 7-Eleven."" In my decades of flying, this was the first time that I was actually scolded after politely requesting a carton of milk! We chose Delta because of a very different experience than we had with the airline about six years ago. This will be our last time with Delta."
"""have never had a bad experience with them""","✅ Trip Verified | San Antonio to Salt Lake City. I love Delta. I have never had a bad experience with them, and I fly with them often! They are hands down the best airline out there and they are extremely understanding and helpful. Their seats are comfortable, they are polite, they have good movies and screens."
"""couldn’t get seat assignments""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight from LA to Brisbane was canceled, so we had to stay in LA overnight and lose a day of our trip. We were rescheduled the next day and lied to the whole time about seating. We couldn’t get seat assignments until 45 minutes before flight. Needless to say we were scattered all over the plane. We finally got to Sydney late missed connecting by 15 minutes to our destination. So we spent the day at the airport."
"""Our flight was canceled""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Ponta Delgada. Delta is not committed to passenger safety or quality service. Our flight from JFK to Ponta Delgada on 8/8/19 & 8/9/19 was canceled and then delayed for over 24 hours. This was due to an inability to replace crews that had timed out and a failure to do a maintenance check on the aircraft which was flying in the air and then required to return back to the US before entering foreign territory. Delta customer service representative was unapologetic, combative and informed us that Delta engages in the practice of flying aircrafts without proper maintenance checks. They did not wish to compensate passengers in any way other than offering a pathetic amount of skymiles to fly them again. We had to practically threaten to sue to just get a $200 credit yet our costs incurred for transportation, food, lodging and the mental anguish was a greater amount."
"""Terrible service""","Not Verified | San Diego to Salt Lake City. Terrible service, I stayed at the airport for the night and no one helped me, no one offered anything and everyone was being rude to me."
"""no urgency or care""","✅ Trip Verified | I had a 5:50 flight from Austin to Atlanta, to then be transferred one hour after arrival to another plane to Cincinnati. But instead, Delta airlines held us on the runway for more than an hour waiting on a single maintenance person to come in and spend literally 2 minutes fixing one of the bathrooms. We waited an entire hour, which made the entire plane which was almost all connections late, for one bathroom to be fixed for a 2 hour flight. The worst service imaginable, now people who were supposed to fly at 10 AM are all being delayed to 3 PM flights, or 5 or even 9. And tomorrow is Labor Day, so some people are actually just stuck here in Atlanta. The worst airline service I’ve ever received, absolutely no urgency or care for the customers. Never fly Delta if you want to arrive on time."
"""ground experience is where Delta fails miserably""","✅ Trip Verified | Richmond to Sint Maarten via Atlanta. Delta actually has a pretty good product once you're on the plane. Seats are comfortable, they have TVs, and the snacks are pretty good. Flight attendants are hit or miss, my first flight had surly ones, while on the second flight they were outstanding. But the ground experience is where Delta fails miserably. They now board international flights 50 minutes early, so I got a series of urgent texts and phone notifications telling me to go to my gate immediately, which stressed me out because my connecting flight was late and I was a terminal away. I rushed to get on the plane only to sit there for another half hour while waiting for all the other connecting passengers to come. I really resented being put in that position of stress when it wasn't necessary, and recommend that Delta put its boarding times later to give connecting passengers time to get there."
"""Continuous delays""","Not Verified | Las Vegas to San Jose. The worst airline to fly domestic in the USA. Continuous delays. No flight has ever departed on time. Took 5 domestic flights during my trip and each flight was delayed by at least 2 hours. Staff is also clueless. Will never recommend this airline to anyone."
"""told I was in the wrong seat""","✅ Trip Verified | La Guardia to Halifax. I booked this flight 6 weeks ago for me and my husband as part of our 20th anniversary vacation. Naturally I booked 2 seats together, 5C and 5D. Because I am 6’6”, I planned to take the aisle seat on the cramped commuter jet. Everything was fine until while boarding the plane I was told “your new seat is 7A”. When I asked if my husband’s seat was also changed I was told it was not. When I said that was not acceptable (which I thought was obvious) I was told we could sit together in 7A and 7B. The problem was they failed to tell that to the person in 7B who was already on the plane. After attempting to get into 7A (a window seat) with minimal success, I sat in my original seat. At that point I was told I was in the wrong seat. When I explained the situation I was told I had been moved to accommodate other passengers who wished to sit together. Not OK. I have contacted Delta and am awaiting a response as to why they believe they have the right to discriminate against others in a country where that is illegal."
"""Delta truly saved our trip""","Not Verified | We were booked on a West Jet flight from Toronto to New York; our flight was cancelled and the best we could get after multiple phone calls to West Jet was arriving at 4pm the next day going through Atlanta on Delta flights. We are so ecstatic that this was the airline we were switched to and that we were diverted through Atlanta. Every single staff member was understanding of the pressure we felt to get to New York in time to see our Broadway show. I don't know if Delta will read this but Matilda at gate T3 on August 23 for the 130pm flight to New York deserves recognition. When we approached her to get information about our now delayed 230pm flight she knew we wouldn't make it in time for our show so she sent us to customer service where they put us as a priority on the stand by list for the 130pm flight which was on time no questions asked. When we got called to get our seats Matilda recognized us and celebrated with us that we were going to make our show. We were glad to have any seat but we were seated in economy plus (it feels like this was a gift from Matilda). When we left Toronto we felt defeated that we had lost a day and a half of our trip and getting to our Broadway show wasn't guaranteed not to mention we were met with horrible customer service. Delta truly saved our trip!"
"""went above and beyond""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Ft Lauderdale. Check in agent Florence (did not get last name) went above and beyond for myself and the 4 boys I was traveling with... She was so polite friendly and offered a smile to calm a very frustrated morning. Left after paying for luggage with a smile and laughing. Wish I would have seen her last name. I hope she gets to see this and know she was appreciated and thank you!"
"""courteous and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Seattle. I don't usually fly Delta Air Lines as they don't have many routes in the city I live in. Having said that, every time I have flown with them (3x in the last 2 years), I found their staff to be courteous and helpful, their seats adequate (although a little hard), good leg room (I'm 6' 4""), and their app (reviewed in 2019) probably the best in the industry. Will fly again."
"""unable to make our departure flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Detroit. Our friends always told us we needed to try the nicer airlines out, but we generally couldn’t afford it so we were excited when we found that Delta had a basic economy flight available for a trip home to visit my family. We though “Finally! We get to fly with an airline that treats their customers well!” Boy were we in for a surprise. I guess you only qualify for Deltas better treatment if you have the money to fly in one of their other classes. Just like everything else in this world, it seems Delta has subscribed to the idea that if you don’t have money, you are worthless and don’t deserve to be treated well. Through a course of events, my husband and I were unable to make our departure flight. When we realized we would not make our flight, I called to discuss what could be done. A Delta representative informed me that because I was a basic economy customer, they could not assist me over the phone, so when we arrived at the airport, we spoke with someone at the counter. The representative we spoke with was very condescending and entirely unhelpful. After scolding us for missing our original flight, they informed us that we would need to rebook and that the cost would be over $300 per passenger. Nowhere in that conversation did they indicate that we would need to rebook our entire trip. Not wanting to spend $600+ on top of what we had already spent, we booked a one-way trip with our usual economy airline. We thought our troubles were over. Sure, we were out a couple hundred dollars, but we made it to family vacation and we had a flight home .. or so we thought... We spent a great week with my family and returned to the airport for our flight back home only to find that our entire reservation had been canceled when we missed our first flight. The individual at the desk this time got on the phone to try to sort things out with us. They found that we would be expected to buy new tickets for a flight home. Again it was suggested that we pay over $300 per passenger to secure our flights home. The individual helping me at the desk held my hand and assured me they understood how I was feeling, but they couldn’t convince the person on the other side of the phone to help us. Eventually, the person on the other end of the phone conceded to crediting is with the cost of our original flights home so that we would pay the difference instead of the full charge to rebook. As if this was some sort of favor... we eventually concede to pay out of desperation to get home for work the next day. All in all, we essentially paid for our entire trip twice. Though the hit to my bank account was painful, the biggest sting wasn’t ultimately the cost; it was the loud and proud message that I only mattered to Delta as a customer if I had been willing to pay more money to them on the front end. Well Delta, you win. You have my money, but certainly not my respect, and surely not my business. Just earlier this year, I had traveled home with an economy airline to help move my grandmother into a nursing home. I had purchased a round trip, but my grandmother ended up passing away and I extended my stay through to my brothers wedding which I had already purchased flights for."
"""Talk about highway robbery""","✅ Trip Verified | Washington to Panama City via Atlanta. Paid $30 for my checked luggage then an extra $100 because it was 6 pounds overweight. Talk about highway robbery. If I wasn’t in a rush to catch my flight, I would have bought a second bag and only paid $60 for both."
"""This airline is a joke""","✅ Trip Verified | San Antonio to Atlanta. This airline is a joke. The first leg of our flight was delayed due to an exit sign missing off the plan. 4 hour delay because they could not find an exit sign to fix the problem. This caused a large number if people to miss connecting flights. Delta didn’t care of the issue. Everyone I spoke with shrugged their shoulders and replied with an “we can’t help”. For my wife and myself, we will miss our connecting flight to Jamaica. Our $1,000 a night resort won’t change our reservations because it is already booked past our date. Delta offers nothing to help correct this. Wish I had booked with airline that doesn’t have plans falling apart and that aren’t able to meet FFA regulations. If the plan is missing exit sign, what else is missing."
"""delays were avoidable and unacceptable""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to New York with Delta Air Lines. Three delays without any excuse. No mechanical or weather related issues affected this flight: DL 2288. Two delays at San Diego resulting in 1 hour 15 minute delay, entering holding pattern 500 miles from destination, taxiing for more than 1/2 hour after arrival at JFK because Delta needed to find an unoccupied gate. These delays were avoidable and unacceptable. Both air and ground operations are to be blamed for a total of nearly three hour delay."
"""Predatory sales practices""","✅ Trip Verified | Predatory sales practices. Fees and what they’re for are not obvious or easily found. Customer Service says one thing and the agents at the airport another. I was told to pay for a checked bag by an agent even though customer service told me it was included. They also shame and embarrass customers for buying economy class tickets. Never flying with them again and will advise anyone I know not to fly with them."
"""they had sold out all seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Spokane via Seattle. Just went to check in for my flight 24 hours prior to departure and found out that they had sold out all seats on the 2nd leg of our flight! No seats? We paid to get from LAX to Spokane, not just halfway. 1.5 hour wait time to speak with a rep. So I guess we're walking from Seattle to Spokane because we didn't realize these crooks require customers to pay an extra $15 per seat to ensure that you actually get a seat on the flight you paid for."
"""Shame on you Delta!""","Not Verified | I was on the Delta flight from Nassau to JFK today and the restroom at the front of the plane was only available for the first class passengers, 16 in total, 3 flight attendants and 2 pilots, where the rest of 144 passengers in the main cabin had to use the restroom in the back of the plane. I was traveling with my 2.5 year old son who said he was cold during the flight and when I asked flight attendant for a blanket I was told they didn’t provide any for that flight, however, as I was leaving the plane I couldn’t help but notice a bunch of unused still in the plastic wrap blankets laying on the floor between the first class seats. Shame on you Delta!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","✅ Trip Verified | I am so pleased with the flight. The staff are very kind and thoughtful, on top of being super nice and professional, I have forgotten my phone in the previous airplane which was also Delta and I had realized when I was already all seated in the next plane and the plane was getting ready to take off within less then 15 min, I went and told this lady that was working there and she immediately knew who to contact and got all of my info and contacted the staffcleaning out the previous plane and within 10 min I got my phone on time before take off! Also the gentlemen that checked me and my family at boarding helped with it and made sure my 3 kids and husband stayed in the same row together. So pleased with this trip! Thank you Delta!"
"""No communication and liars""","✅ Trip Verified | Miami to La Guardia. My second worst experience with Delta. They board and then cancel flight without informing customers. I was on the phone 12 hours before and was never told that they had been canceling flights. We got to Fort Lauderdale and our flight was delayed only to be canceled after being on the plane and they kept giving excuse after excuse. We get to Miami only to be told our flight was canceled again. We got the same fueling excuse. It is horrible. No communication and liars."
"""canceled my seat without my request""","✅ Trip Verified | They canceled my flight the night before on 8/18. Was supposed to have me on the morning flight on 8/19. Sent me an email saying I was on the flight and then I go to check in on 8/19 and they say I have no seat. They canceled my seat without my request. Do not fly with Delta for they don't care to screw you out of your seat after they canceled your flight before over weather."
"""Do not fly Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Montreal to New York. Plane landed on time and approached a gate that was already occupied. We were told we needed to wait until it unloaded passengers. Then we were told there was another plane ahead of us in the line to the gate. We waited some more until we were told that the plane needed to go to another gate. This is about 40 minutes later the we got off the plane. We were told to take a shuttle bus to the baggage claim. That bus filled up before we could board and we needed to wait for a second bus. The second bus arrived and before we boarded the dispatcher told us to get off at the 2nd stop. The bus driver and a second dispatcher argued about whether to wait for another flight to fill the bus before we departed. The driver did not want to wait so we left and at the second stop they switched drivers. The new driver refused to let us get off the bus. He proceeded to drive us back to where we started. We told the dispatcher what happened and he berated us for listening to the driver rather than sympathize with our being subjected to wasted time and confusion. We called Delta and related the story. The service person on the phone said 'What do you expect me to do about this?'. I said this is very poor service and is there some way we could be compensated. She disconnected me. Do not fly Delta."
"""There was no remorse when I called customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Usually I have no complaints whatsoever flying with Delta, but this time I had the worst experience. Firstly my flight from Lansing Michigan to Detroit was fine. However my flight from Detroit to Atlanta had an hour and a half layover which was okay with me. As soon as I stepped off the plane from Lansing, I received an email that my flight would be delayed another hour which was okay with me once again. I had a connecting flight in Atlanta to Gulfport that departed at 9.38. My flight from Detroit was supposed to land in Atlanta at 7.48 didn't land there until 9.15. After sprinting to the gate after having to stare at a monitor for my gate number I hurriedly made my way to my gate only for them to announce that my flight departed 5 minutes early. I was in tears almost with how frustrated I was. I was trying to get to Mississippi to see my brother off before he got deployed and also celebrate his birthday before he left. Fortunately the flight attendant was able to give me a care pouch and a hotel room although I had no access to my luggage and my cellphone was dying. Eventually I made it to Gulfport and spent time with my brother before he left for deployment. On my way back home, my flight from Atlanta to Detroit was delayed once again causing me to miss my connecting flight home. My mother who was 50 plus years old drove at midnight to come and get me from Detroit airport because they wouldn't give me a hotel room for the night and wanted everyone to stay the night in the airport. There was no remorse when I called customer service and explained everything to them. They told me they'd get back to me in seven business days for my refund for the last of my trip and offered me a $25 gift card. This was by far the worst experience and I will more than likely never fly Delta again. I was better off flying Spirit. Delta Charges too much money for them to be treating their customer's like this. Never again."
"""now your fleecing my points""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta CEO and policy makers, I’ve been a loyal Delta customer for almost my entire 30 year career, I live in Atlanta, your HQ. I not only fly Delta, I pay for the sky club every year and I have a Delta American Express card. Even though I have to consider all airfare costs, all the time for my company, I prefer Delta and choose Delta whenever possible, until now. I have spent decades building up my points. Late nights, early mornings, delayed flights, 60+ overnight stays a year away from my family and more. It’s a lot of sacrifice to be able to take advantage of miles I’ve worked extremely hard for once or twice a year, only find out, Delta can manipulate markets and gauge customers like me and pull all those decades of earned miles right out of my pocket in an instance. And not a few thousand, 100s of thousands! Which brings me to my issue. My fiancé is from Brazil. She comes from a big family with great tradition of family events and putting family first. Her parents are celebrating 50 years of marriage. We can not miss that event. I’ve been working on a trip to take advantage of my rewards from decades of travel. It occurred to me, that if I am to leave my native city (Atlanta) to Sau Paulo. The cost for us to leave Atlanta is outrageous. The points cost us more than double compared to other airports in the vicinity. We’re trying to work through it and be creative but it is a huge waste of time and energy. Not only in trying to source the trip and solve the problem, but also in having to fly to another airport just to preserve my hard earned points. And this email is just another big waste of my time. To make matters worse you’re having us leave an airport (Miami) we don’t even want to depart from, only to come back to Atlanta and do a 10 hour layover. To make matters worse my fiancé can not afford to travel that day to Miami and back to Atlanta, because she only has a sitter for the Atlanta to Sau Paulo trip and we’re struggling to find a way to keep her in Atlanta, even if I have to go out of my way to Miami, just to protect some of my hard earned points. If I was to transition her ticket to the Atlanta portion only, the cost to my personal point status is crippling. I’m writing to you because I’ve been loyal for decades. I’ve supported Delta for decades (flights. Credit cards, sky club, etc). I’ve never complained. I’ve supported you and now your fleecing my points because you’re too rigid to solve this problem. I can’t accept the negative impact I’m being subjected to, after all the sacrifice I’ve withstood to earn my points. I don’t accept it. You tag line, printed on your napkin (see photo) states, 'the world is better without you in it'. What you’re doing to me, my fiancé, her daughter and our trip flies in the face of this tag line. You’re supposed to encourage us to venture out, travel, adventure, etc.. Not discourage us and penalize us. I’m not some one-timer. Look at my vast history. The fact that you’re setting markets up for price gauging with a personal impact to someone like me, is completely opposed to your messaging. So if you’re going to be an impediment to your own tag line, I’d suggest you stop using it."
"""rude, disrespectful employee""","Not Verified | Miami to Atlanta via Pittsburgh. My Husband and I celebrated our 1-year Anniversary and thanks to Delta to give us a horrible ending to our vacation. It first started in Miami where there were 2 or 3 delays for the flight from Miami to Atlanta, there were no announcements regarding why the delays were happening and no information given whatsoever. The weather was a little overcast sky, but that was it. Once we finally boarded the aircraft, we landed in Atlanta 15 minutes after our connected flight had already left. We were not sure what our next steps were, so we went to the Delta Help counter on Concourse A where we encountered a nasty, condescending, rude, disrespectful employee. It was bad enough that we were upset that we missed our flight, but to make matters worse to endure her and her unpleasant attitude. First of all, in Miami there was no reason given why our flight was delayed and then when we got to Atlanta we had to stay in the airport all night and were not compensated or reimbursed for anything, not so much as a blanket, a cup of coffee or water. I understand that things happen but to be treated in the matter of which we were is Unacceptable and definitely not customer-oriented or customer friendly, at all. From the first delay, where there were no updates, to the rude employee, to no compensation for anything, not to mention that my husband and I missed a day of work and missed wages and had to pay an extra day of parking at our original destination where we had parked and pre-paid. I definitely would not recommend your airline to anyone. Based on the unjust treatment and the lack of concern from your company and employee Lucille, I somehow, sincerely doubt that this complaint would be viewed or given any consideration, but I had to air my true disappointment in a company that I view totally different now."
"""customer service is amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to New York JFK. Contrary to popular belief that they handle their customers poorly they are very excellent in their customer service. I am talking about the Flight Attendants. They are well-groomed and their well-mannered employees. They are also very helpful in our baby and our staff. The food is OK but the customer service is amazing!"
"""By far the worst experience""","✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Piedmont via Atlanta. By far the worst experience. I was not able to select seats at time of booking. Neither at check in. The process is wild, I was given the second last row which is not not a problem but the stench is unbelievable and unbearable. Cannot believe the most advanced country can have airlines that smell this bad. I have travelled around the world quiet a bit but have never experienced something this bad. Passengers were spraying whatever possible to make it they the nearly 5 hour flight."
"""how hot the cabin was""","✅ Trip Verified | Honolulu to Salt Lake City. Seats are crammed. The worst part of the entire experience though is how hot the cabin was during the flight. They assured us that as soon as we were in the air that it would cool down. It didn't. The over head air vents didn't help even a little bit. Hot as hell."
"""Absolute nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Charleston. Absolute nightmare. Delta will leave you for days in any city with children and no baggage. Their baggage claim guy yelled at me in front of my child when I ask how many hours until I could get my bag. They are uncaring as to whether you have food, shelter, or anything else. They cost me $1000 dollars and missing my boys 10th birthday, and so much exhaustion and stress. No one in my family will fly Delta again. They do not care about you or your family in any way. I really feel for those less fortunate who did not have the resources I did."
"""highly recommend Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at Dublin Airport early for the flight to leave checked baggage and check-in, no lines at either bag drop or check-in! Great gate staff who were able to assist us by confirming our pre-ordered vegetarian meals. Flight left on time! After take off two snacks (snack mix & biscoff cookies) and a drink from a selection of alcoholic or soft drinks were provided free of charge! Vegetarian meals were handed out a few minutes before the standard meals, meal was horrible, a vegetarian (not vegan) consisted of gluten free pasta, no dairy whatsoever, along with a salad and a gluten free bread roll. I would suggest vegetarians opt for the vegetarian meal that is provided onboard without needing to preorder. Asked for the other vegetarian meal that people who did not preorder got and it was great. Cabin crew were extremely attentive and did a drinks service every 45 minutes. About 2.5 hours before landing a vegetarian snack bag and burrito was handed out which were both decent. About 1 hour before landing ice cream was handed out. I had lost my phone and had asked the cabin crew if it was okay if I could have a look for it at my seat they allowed me too and even helped me search for it. Had a nice conversation with the same member of cabin crew, one thing about Delta is they have outstanding staff. We collected our baggage which was fine and not damaged whatsoever. Would highly recommend Delta, the best airline that I have flown."
"""never forget our horrific experience""","Not Verified | St Louis to Aruba via Atlanta. My husband and I got married Saturday Aug 3, 2019. We planned our honeymoon following immediately after for Monday Aug 5th, 2019 to Saturday Aug 10th, 2019 to Oranjestad, Aruba. Though we’ve never flew with Delta airlines before, there were no worries that our honeymoon would be amazing. When we arrived to the Delta check – in , there was an older gentlemen who was kind enough to help get our luggage checked in, he stated that he had just sent us off to Aruba and that some sort of gratuity would be in order, we tipped him and went on our way. Things were running smooth, however, instead of departing at 7:00 am like our boarding passes stated, Delta flight 1080 to ATL start boarding at 7:00 am, which posed no issue at the time us, because my husband and I were present at the gate. Although boarding to ATL was passed time, the flight made good timing. We arrived in ATL at 9:50 am instead of 9:31am like our boarding passes and check in stated. My husband and I had assigned seats in the back of the plane, separately in rows 35 B and 35 F. It took a total of 20 minutes to get off the Delta flight 1080 from STL. We got off from our flight around 10:10 am, unlike other airlines we have been on, Delta requires you to go see a monitor for further instructions on boarding. My husband and I immediately went to the nearest monitor to locate the appropriate gate for our connecting flight to Aruba. In the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, there is a train that connects at each gate. The gate assembly starts at T, then A, B, C, D, E. it took my husband and I a total of 15 minutes to get from off flight 1080 to Gate T, then Gate E. GATE E 14. The gate that will forever be in our memory. Delta Flight 655, Departure time was set for 10:41 am on our boarding passes and once we arrived at gate E 14 at 10:28 am. Our flight was gone. Boarding had ended, and our fight had fully departed. My heart sank, we were in disbelief. Frantic, I ask the Delta representative at gate E 14 where our plane was and the gentlemen stated that the flight left at 10:26 am. My husband and I spoke with several representatives who were rude and unempathetic as they made things seems as though it was our fault that we were late. I was honestly unable to comprehend why our flight was gone and it was well before 10:41 am. Absolutely devastated, my questions meant nothing to anyone. There was even a gentleman who worked for Delta who felt it was appropriate to tell us that he called us on the intercom to board while we were on our way from our first flight because they knew we had checked in from our previous flight from STL. We were offered a complimentary flight for the next day only after we asked to speak to a supervisor. Defeated, we accepted with no choice. We asked for a complimentary room for Delta’s inconvenience and we were laughed at by the Supervisor. My husband and I spent the first day of our honeymoon in the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. (over 24 hours) My husband and I had no luggage as we spent the night in an unknown State. We were responsible for late check in fees to our resort in Aruba. We were charged cancellation fees for reservations made on our first day of arrival. We will never forget our horrific experience and never trust this airline again, regardless of cost."
"""move up as a wedding gift from him""","Not Verified | My fiance & I had the same flight attendant flying to Destin and back to Nebraska. His name is Ken and we know he lives in MN. This guy, in my opinion, is a top-notch flight attendant. He helped me out with my wedding dress on the way down. On our way back, there was room in the back of first-class and he asked if we would like to move up as a ""wedding gift"" from him. That was super kind of him and we did not expect that nor did he need to. It was just such a kind gesture that we've never received before. Very pleasant gentleman, polite, and goes above and beyond the call of duty. We just wanted to let the company of Delta know that Ken is an excellent employee!"
"""Delta did nothing to assist""","✅ Trip Verified | Our flight from New York to Jacksonville was eventually cancelled after 9 hours or so. We immediately went to Delta to reschedule the flight. We were told no flights for 2 days. We had paid extra so we could choose our seats. Delta Main vs Economy. When we were rebooked we were put at the very back of the plane. Our friends who purchased economy were put in the middle around row 19. The cancellation and not able to get out of NYC costed us an additional $900. Thankfully, we could afford to get rooms. Many couldn't. Delta did absolutely nothing to assist. I get weather causes delays and cancellations, but not for 2 days. When I contacted Delta, they offered $25 or 500 miles in the spirit of goodwill. I try to use Delta vs low cost carriers for better options when these things occur. Not anymore, there is no difference that I am able to see."
"""not charge us as a one time courtesy""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew from Nashville to Atlanta first. We arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to Amsterdam. We found our gate and then we went to T G Fridays. We knew the flight would start boarding at 3:15, so we got there but no one was there! We went to another gate and were told the flight had left but there was also a flight leaving at 5:30. We were sent to a customer service area in the middle of the Gate E. I accidentally got in the Platinum line. I told her I was not Platinum but we just missed our flight. I wish I knew her name. She asked why we missed our flight. I said it was our fault and that we were stupid. I did not realize until we were on our new flight to Amsterdam that there was a time difference of one hour that we had not accounted for. The lady said they would not charge us as a one time courtesy. She was an angel!"
"""non attentive Flight Attendants""","✅ Trip Verified | Spokane to Salt Lake via Fresno. From overbooked flight to APPS not working, cramped space and non attentive Flight Attendants, I'm done!! I had a choice and I should have flown Alaska. They are the best. I booked my flight 30 days in advance and still paid $726 round trip! Ridiculous"
"""Delta will not help you out""","✅ Trip Verified | Kansas City to Minneapolis. Delta does not allow you to sit standby if you buy their basic economy class. You have to pay for the more expensive tickets for this feature. This makes it difficult to flex with a military work schedule. So if you get off early and want to try and get on an earlier flight. Forget about it because Delta will not help you out."
"""$75 to fly standby""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to St Louis. $75 to fly standby. That's all I need to say. Generally I really like Delta flights and how they are ran. But this is a serious customer service issue. Other airlines still allow you to fly standby on earlier flights for free. Delta decided to be greedy and monetize this. It takes them very little effort and probably makes them more money in the long run to allow standby passengers for free. It make sure the flights are full and provides the airline better flexibility in later flights to change and add passengers. But, Delta decided to go to the dark side on this one, forgo good will to their customers and make that extra $75. I personally will make sure to fly United or Southwest in the future if I have the reasonable option. I'm not swearing off Delta entirely as I care for convenience in my travel first and foremost, but I do guarantee I will purchase at least a couple fewer Delta tickets this year. I suggest if you want the flexibility to fly standby without any extra charge, that you fly with a different airline as well."
"""Nicely done Delta""","NotVerified | Albuquerque to New Orleans via Salt Lake City. Great flight into SLC. Got delayed and cancelled on the Tarmac leaving SLC. Got lucky and had an available plane and reboarded within an hour and a half. Staff were very communicative and had a snack/drink tray waiting for us as we deboarded for the delay. Best experience I have had with a flight crew/airline. Almost every other flight I’ve ever been on with other airlines have been absolutely miserable. Nicely done Delta."
"""helpless and very disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Venice. My 14 old brother was a part of mandatory UMNR program. The whole registration process was a mess. At first we were told by a registration agent that he wasn't registered for a program, when I insisted that he was as I wouldn't be able to purchase a ticket without registering him for a program, the agent was able to find a record. Without apologizing for the stress, he proceeded registering my brother and printed his boarding pass with the assigned seat that I requested 6 moths ago 40A (near the window). At the time of the boarding after standing in line we were told by the stewardess in a pretty rude tone that my brother will be boarding the last. We waited for an entire airplane to board and the stewardess finally nodded us that we can go ahead. She then printed additional slip and without showing it to me took my brother to board. When the plane took off, my brother texted me that he was seated to the seat #17 in between two other passengers and his requested and already assigned seat was given away to somebody else. Nobody told me that at the time I was passing my brother to the Delta Airline agent, and needless to say my brother who studies English as a second language wasn't able to raise a concern on his own. I felt helpless and very disappointed. The terrible service we received cost us $150 in addition to the plain ticket and caused the worst international travel experience. This complain was submitted at the airline website first to give them a chance to respond. After waiting for a month with no respond, I am re-posting here."
"""I will never fly Delta again""","Not Verified | Portland to Washington. I hate that I’m wasting more energy on Delta, but people need to know how they treat people, their kids, and their belongings. My kids had an unaccompanied minor reservation. Anytime you make an unaccompanied minor’s reservation, you have to do it over the phone. So when I got to the airport an hour and a half before my kids flight, Delta proceeded to tell me that they could not go through TSA because they had to be two hours early. I begin to explain to them that no one informed me of this very strict rule, and that I had no way of knowing that. They were condescending towards me and said it wasn’t their job to tell me when to be at the airport, and I could read it in the “contract I signed”. I informed them that I clearly haven’t signed anything, because it’s an airline requirement that I book over the phone. I asked if they could get a flight for them that same day, but they could not due to flight times. So I then asked if they could compensate us in someway for the inconvenience because I had to work a double the next day and they said no and I got upset and began to panic because I didn’t know what to do (I have severe anxiety), and she immediately got fed up with me and told me that she would not help me and that she would just document that I got there late (which is a lie). She then told me that I needed to call the unaccompanied minors hotline to change my kids flight if I wanted any help at all. I then called the hotline, and that person helped, and was apologetic. So because of this, I had to wake up at 4:30 a.m to get them to the airport on time and then go straight to work to work a double. But when we got to the airport the next day, and we were checking my daughters suitcase at the desk, the delta employee put her bag on the belt without tagging it first! I look at her like... is my kids bag going to get lost? She assured me it would arrive to their destination. I didn’t believe them but I wasn’t going to waste time asking for management after the way I’d been treated before. So we finally get to the gate, and when they go to board the delta employee snaps at the parents to say their goodbyes and was just very stern in general, and when I was hugging my kids goodbye she snapped at me and said “you need to stay back” I just looked at her like “I’m just trying to hug them goodbye” and even another mom came up to me and said “they have no sympathy for moms with anxiety, do they?” And if only she knew the half of it. You’d think this review stops here, but it doesn’t. Hours after I send my kids off with these unprofessional people, which I wish I hadn’t, I get a text from my son saying that there was a problem with the gate, and that they got there late and we’re at a completely different airport. Mind you, I am paying a couple hundred dollars for someone to escort them to their gate on time, And to make sure they get to the correct destination and airport. And THEN I find out that they in fact sent my kids suitcase to the wrong airport, and their dad had to drive to two different airports and pay $50 in parking. I will never fly Delta again, nor will I recommend them."
"""our flight got cancelled""","Not Verified | I’m so sleep deprived I don’t even know what time it is. Our 45 minute flight was scheduled at no later than 11pm last night and now it is currently set to leave at noon today! That’s only after buying new tickets, as our flight got cancelled after a 3 hour delay at the last minute. If you’re in a rush to get home and want to end up frustrated because you’re stuck in an airport, I highly recommend flying with Delta Airlines. Not only will they not compensate you, but they will also lose your luggage! But on the bright side, we did get free snacks. Why, I love a granola bar. So worth my 700$ ticket and my luggage. I really wish I could say this is the first time we’ve had this issue, or the second time, or the third. Could be worse. At least I’m not on the 48 hour delay flights like most people around me. As for the other airlines? They’re doing fine."
"""no need to be intolerable""","Not Verified | New York to Syracuse. Most of my experiences were great. But this last flight to SYR flight DL 5177 the flight attendant was very late due to her previous flight. But because she was all huffy from being late she was extremely rude. She was in a rush to get us out, but no need to be intolerable. Instead of trying to help the bag situation, she gave me too brief of a response and I couldn’t understand what she was saying. Unwilling to help. Was fine acting like a jerk though."
"""Thank you Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Short version: Delta is the best! Long version: I made a mistake while booking two-way flight tickets from Boston to Nashville. Travelling from Boston to Nashville did go well on August 5th. I booked my return flight for the very next day (August 6th) at least I thought that. However, I realized that I did book my return ticket for August 7th while checking in at Airport. I didn't know how to react (I was the victim for my mistake). Anyways, went to counter and the Delta person was really polite and nice. He asked for a moment to talk with someone behind the counter and he returned saying I am good to travel today (August 6th) for no more charges or anything. I was expecting for pay somewhere around $50 - $100 USD. But they were too good to forgive my mistake and now I am at the gates about to board the flight to Boston. Thank you Delta (and your employees)!"
"""can't believe how I was treated""","✅ Trip Verified | I was flying with my 2 children who are under the age of 6. We were not seated together & I couldn't change it online because there was not seen entire row available for us so I waited until I got to the gate & requested a change which worked out well for me until I reached Atlanta on our way back. I asked the representative at the gate if she could change the seats & she stated ""Ma'am this flight is completely booked so you'll have to figure it out when you get on the plane."" I stood there for a moment & I asked her if there were any other options & she said yes you have the option to figure it out yourself. I grabbed my 2 kids & begin to broad the plane in tears which is when the flight attendants were beyond helpful in placing me and my small children together. I can't believe how I was treated by an employee of Delta Airlines right in the founding city, Atlanta!"
"""had a horrible attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | They let everybody board the plane before then telling everyone in the exact quote from the pilot ""sorry but we're going to be here for a while because we don't have any idea where the co pilot is"". Then an hour later while still sitting at the gate not offering any sort of drink service or snacks they finally started to finish with the gate closing and acted like it was no big deal that they've had us stuffed in the plane for this long. The desk attendants had a horrible attitude then their lack of any kind of knowledge of the problem at hand was unbelievable."
"""Will never fly with again""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Vancouver. Understandably, we were delayed from a 9:25pm flight due to bad weather (thunderstorms, rain, etc), and they had to search for a new route to take. This took 3.5 hours, which I guess is justifiable when looking for a safe route. HOWEVER, for some reason we had to make a stop in Minnesota for a pilot change. The flight crew assured us that a new one would be waiting at the airport so it’d be a quick stop so we can get back on our way. Sure why not, maybe the pilot was supposed to be off around our original departure time. BUT, it takes 2.5 hours to get from New York to Minnesota and on top of the 3.5 hour original delay, they had 6 hours to find a new pilot. Guess what? When we arrived at the airport there was no pilot available. They told us it’d be another 3 hour delay annoying literally everyone on board because they couldn’t find another pilot to take over. It was 3am when we arrived, so we leave again at 6am. Well guess what, 2 hours into the wait they said it’s likely going to be an extra 1.75 hours (departure now 7:45am) because they STILL couldn’t find another damn pilot to fly the stupid plane. This comes to a total of around 8 hours of flight delays with half of the time not being due to weather anymore, but incompetence. It’s 5am as I write this (they just made the extended delay announcement), and I’m hoping it doesn’t extend again cause this is ridiculous. Will never fly with again."
"""never fly Delta ever again""","Not Verified | Worst experience flying ever. Few into Dallas from Puerto Rico, they lost our luggage, told us our best option was to pick it up the next day, drove all the way the next day which is over an our drive, and there is no Delta airlines employees in the entire airport, was told we had to come back yet again the next day. I am beyond mad, we have a 5 day vacation stay and we are now on our 3rd day just driving back and fourth to the airport waiting to get our luggage, not to mention the horrible delta call service that hung up on us 3 times. Will never fly Delta ever again."
"""made my day so much better""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Salt Lake City. I was very stressed and overwhelmed after a nightmare of an experience with norwegian. That’s when Angelina who works for special services at Delta at the Seattle Tacoma airport made my day so much better by easily switching my flight, and to my luck the Austin flight was delayed so I got to switch for free. She was so incredibly kind, and made me feel welcomed after long days of feeling neglected. Going to fly Delta much more often just because of Angelina and her sincerity!"
"""Delta One cabin was dirty""","✅ Trip Verified | Munich to Detroit. Amazing crew, fairly good food and that is where it stops. Delta One cabin was dirty, I had to clean around my seat with the tissues and hand sanitizers that came out filthy. Seats are also in poor condition. Considering how well the airline is doing, they could do a better job maintaining cabins."
"""Thank you so much Delta""","Not Verified | LaGuardia to New Orleans. My husband and I are so appreciative of the services we received from the Delta Staff on August 3rd, 2019, flight DL1644. I couldn’t hold back tears after we were surprised with a gift, upgraded seats, meal tickets and congratulated messages for our wedding anniversary. This is by far one of the biggest surprises I have ever received. Our encounter with the representatives was enough for us, so, to acknowledge us in this way, was the icing on the cake. This experience made us realize, never use on experience with an individual to judge a group of people. Thank you so much Delta, you sure made us felt special, especially for our anniversary."
"""missed our connecting flight""","Not Verified | Boston to Cancun via Atlanta. Today Aug 3rd we were planned to leave at 6am and plane was boarded completely. Then they announced that there will be delay because there was too much fuel - so they had to take it out and rebalance the wings - we rebooked the connecting flight using their App as they directed us. And as soon as we did that, the delay time increased. All in all more than 2 hrs delay - so we missed our next connecting flight. And now their App won’t allow us to rebook to next available flight. So many people left the plane. Punctuality matters, please keep passengers time in mind. And please make immediate arrangements for each and every passenger - that is going above and beyond to be best airline."
"""put customer first in difficult time""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Paris via Minneapolis. Due to an unfortunate turn of event with my health, I couldn't make the trip for my vacation at the last minute. Even though I purchased a pair of non-refundable and non-exchangeable tickets, Delta Airline customer services was very understanding, sensitive and supportive of a difficult time I experienced. After a few validation steps, they immediately issued full value vouchers for me and my wife valid for 1 year. The whole interaction was painless and effortless. I praise this company's business ethics to put customer first in difficult time."
"""an unannounced gate change""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Kansas City. Our return flight (DL2751) 28 July was good but on the trip out we missed our flight because of an unannounced gate change. When I asked the rebooking agent how they can change your gate and not tell you? she said they were not allowed to announce gate changes. This made no sense to me I assumed Delta was cashing in on the unrefundable nature of our ticket. If not They probably assumed sitting at gate A6 we could hear the announcements for our flight boarding at gate A9 when there were 3 restraints and a sound wall between these gates what they should have done is completely refund our ticket and given us free seats on the next flight out."
"""the worst flight experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Stuttgart. This was the worst flight experience I have had. Our flight had to turn around and land due to a landing gear issue. Once we landed we stood in taxi for well over an hour. After being released we learned that the flight was cancelled. Everyone aboard was granted a hotel room voucher except me because I’m only 17. As a result I had to stay over night in the airport, until later afternoon the next day. When my relief flight went into place we were put into delay yet again before take off. Please just save yourself the trouble and don’t use this airline."
"""does not cover broken wheels or handles""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Washington. I've always liked Delta up until today. Today when I picked up my bag from baggage claim, I noticed that my wheel had completely broken off from my suitcase. I attempted to file a claim but was notified that Delta does not cover broken wheels or handles. What else would even break on a suitcase? It is very disappointing that the staff is allowed to throw paying customers' suitcases around, break them, and no one is held accountable. I haven't even had that suitcase for a year and now it's broken and I have to replace it with no help or concern from Delta. Extremely disappointed in this airline."
"""we will not be returning""","Not Verified | Midway to Munich via Chicago. As a frequent flyer, I typically choose Southwest when traveling for vacation or business. I have experienced delays, diversions, and cancellations numerous times and greatly appreciated the courtesy of the southwest airlines employees. However, my family and I chose Delta for our flight to Germany as the prices were much cheaper than Southwest. Upon arrival to Midway on a Monday morning, we stood in line for 30-45 minutes just to check our bags because they only had 1 person working. this person completely ignored the long line of non-sky miles passengers, including a disabled man who was struggling to stand for the long wait period. Fast forwarding to our flight, we were delayed 3 separate times (at the fault of weather, not Delta). However, we had to reschedule our flight to depart from O'Hare due to an insufficient layover time. We proceeded to Midway Delta baggage claim office and found that the door was locked and the office left empty. We asked the Delta office next door for assistance and they rudely told us to return exactly where we came from. Even though we are in a hurry to catch our flight at O'Hare airport, we were met Delta workers who were extremely rude, dismissive, and unwilling to help us. I can confidently say that this will be my first and only experience with Delta airlines. we will not be returning."
"""service was horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Sacramento to New York JFK via Minneapolis St Paul. Deplorable flight, service was horrible, food was disgusting, and the plane was filthy. I had to ask an attendant to clean the grease out of my seat before I could sit down. My shoes stuck to the wet sticky carpet and I was expected to put my bag under the seat in that filth. To top it off, we went to the Delta Sky Club to sit in quiet comfort for our 2 1/2 hr layover in St. Paul Minneapolis and we’re told “you can’t come in here”. I ask why, showing my ticket again and she said “your not international”. WOW, Delta, we’re Seniors, my husband has to walk with a cane, we paid for first class tickets, and certainly expect first class service! Deplorable!!!!"
"""seating was ridiculously close""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to New Orleans. The economy seating was ridiculously close I'm only six feet tall and my knees were touching the seat in front of me . Delta air line is very greedy for money. My last time flying Delta."
"""abandoned my minor child""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Traverse City via Detroit. Delta abandoned my minor child in the Detroit airport and told her she was stuck there for 2 days after her flight was canceled. We had to drive 10 hours to go and rescue her. To add even more insult they offered us a $45 credit for the cancelled flight."
"""they had taken out 28 bottles""","✅ Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to LaGuardia. On June 15, 2019, I took a flight from FLL to LGA and when I was in Florida, a Delta employee checked all of my 7 suitcases. I paid extra weight and I went in the plane, when I was in the plane, in my seat 24F a Delta employee told me they had taken out a couple of bottles of liquor, after I paid for the extra weight. She told me that in order to get my bottles back all I had to do was call Delta the moment we landed. When I got home I noticed they had taken bottles of 4 of my suitcases not just one. That they had taken out 28 bottles. The problem was that when I called them the same night they said they had nothing but they would call me back, two weeks later passed they still hadn't call me and every single time I called I was told ""we will call you back"". I called them back almost every single day, every single time it was a different story and when finally someone told me that in fact those bottles where there, the next day they would say they had nothing. I don't understand how those bottles be there one day and then be gone the next day. As much as I like Delta I have to say that they or whoever opened my suitcases broke the rules because by law they are supposed to open my suitcases in front of me, they are supposed to call me to let me know that they are going to open them and none of that happened. Its over a month now and I've only gotten 7 of my bottles after they said they had 8. I no longer know what to do. I call Delta I call the TSA and all they say is that they only have 7 when I know for a fact that they have the remaining bottles."
"""I’m extremely disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Phoenix. I’m extremely disappointed in the quality of service of Delta. I had a one hour flight home from L.A. to Phoenix and about an hour before take off, I received a notification that the gate has changed and the time of departure has been delayed 5 hours (which would get me home by 1am - originally would have landed at 8pm). I spoke to 3 customer service reps, 2 by phone and 1 at the airport, and none were helpful in getting me on a new flight. What frustrated me most is they didn’t even try and offered me a $25 meal voucher. Keep in mind the terminal has about 2 food options, both of which are terrible, so I declined the voucher. I could have driven home sooner than the new arrival time, but because they notified us about the delay an hour before take off, it was too late to leave the airport, shuttle to the car rental, and drive home (leaving this airport is a nightmare). I am beyond unhappy with Delta and do not recommend this airline."
"""still waiting on my bag""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Des Moines. Well first my bag didn’t come in on my plane then they sent it to the wrong airport so they called me the next day told me it was on the baggage claim and I said I was at work, I’ll call when I get off. So I called back then they told me it got sent to another airport and it wasn’t in. Here I am at 10:30 two days later still waiting on my bag so I can work. They messed up twice in one bag in a night - the only reason they got one star is cause I can’t give zero."
"""always a delay somewhere""","✅ Trip Verified | Columbus to Toronto via Atlanta. First flight was delayed to Detroit resulting in a missed layover. No problem, they let me reschedule for free even though I had an extra 3 more hours to spend in flight time which would have resulted in a cheaper flight from the start. New flight has me going through Atlanta where my connecting flight is delayed 3 hours because the original aircraft scheduled to Toronto was changed to Memphis 30 minutes before boarding time. I may just be upset in the moment, or it could be that anytime I fly with Delta there is always a delay somewhere. The aircraft and staff are usually friendly, this is more directed to overall operations of the airline."
"""It’s the worst airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Nashville to Atlanta. I’ll never fly with delta again! It’s the worst airline! I was flying 40 time in the past 2 years. And 12 times with delta and every time my flight was delayed for 2-6 hours. (Expect one) They never tell you a reason I never hat that problem with a different airline! Then they damaged my suite case twice and filled out a complain paper and they told me they can’t help me!? The same with something I forgot in the plane. They even didn’t wanted to help me. They have the worst costumer services I called them 2 hours later they called me back and I tried to talk very nice but after 10 minutes they just hang up! The worst I would never fly with delta again!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","✅ Trip Verified | Had the worst experience with Delta Airlines. First, I had my flight to Chicago delayed because of a problem with a crew member, and then the flight eventually got canceled because of a rain. When I asked for a reimbursement, they denied because the flight is canceled due to weather. I didn’t get any refund for a bus ticket I already paid for in Chicago, or a place to stay. They gave me another flight to Chicago that stops in Atlanta, which is also delayed, and so was my flight from Atlanta to Chicago. Because of Delta’s inability to schedule flights correctly, I missed a bus that I paid 40 dollars for. I also had to wait 3 hours in Chicago because they left my bag in Atlanta for whatever reason. Don’t fly with Delta Airlines"
"""never fly Delta ever again""","Not Verified | Absolutely terrible, I will never fly Delta ever again. I was scheduled to fly to New York on the 17th at 11:30 am. That flight got delayed until 12:30, we then proceeded to board yet we sat on the runway for over an hour because of weather conditions. We then were told to deboard but stay close because we will take off soon. This never happened, they then canceled the flight and scheduled another one for later, that got canceled and then told us to wait for another flight at 1:30 am. We waited 15 mins before boarding and they proceeded to cancel it yet again. That means my family, along with everyone else had to sleep in the airport. There were cots lined up for miles, but we had to get up at 4 am to put them away. My flight now today was supposed to leave at 6 this morning. It’s now 6:10 and it’s delayed yet again because apparently they prioritize flights from today over flights that should’ve left yesterday. They are terrible at communicating and we’ve had to switch gates numerous times, it’s ridiculous. I would never recommend this airline upon anyone, they just take your money and run."
"""communication was horrible""","Not Verified | Chicago to New York. I had a flight booked for 11:30 am, that got delayed, then we proceeded to board and get out on the runway in hopes of leaving. We came back because of weather issues and had to get off the plane. They then scheduled us for 3 more flights which they canceled with terrible communication. The communication was horrible, nobody knew what was happening until a few minutes before boarding. The app and TV were both giving us wrong information. The TV claimed that our flight had departed when it wasn’t even at the gate yet. It had many people frantically moving, worrying about missing their flight."
"""appalling customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Asheville to Bonaire via Atlanta. I am writing only because of the appalling customer service I recently received. I know the flights are full and tensions are high however Delta puts it head and the ground and ignores it. We were on a flight from Asheville to Bonaire via Atlanta. The flight from Asheville had a small mechanical problem. It took the mechanic less than a minute to fix, however it took the mechanic 1.5 hours to get to the airport. Really? So we, four of us, missed our flight to Bonaire. This was at 9am and we are in Atlanta now for a full 24 hours - they would not put us on another flight. We go to the customer service desk and give us voucher to a motel that their employees do not even stay in. We asked for another option, with a restaurant and they said they do not give hotel vouchers to hotels with restaurants. No food vouchers, no transportation, nothing. We asked to talk to a manager and they gave us a number that is only answered Monday through Friday 9 to 5pm. It is a Saturday and we are flying out of the country. We have a water front condo with two bedrooms and a car rental that we lost out on. The next day we have to check our bags in all over again. My husband and I wait in line to check our bags in. We had picked them up the day before so we could have our things. After 25 minutes to do this, we are told we have to go into another line b/c there is no record we had paid for a bag the day before to Bonaire. There was another 20 to 30 minute line. I asked if she could take us to the front of the line and she said no. My husband nearly had a melt down. He gave me the dressing down and she felt so badly she took us over and checked us in. NOW WHY COULD SHE NOT DO THAT TO BEGIN WITH. I felt like they were trying to make us late and we would miss our flight again."
"""look for alternatives""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Burlington. Awful and unacceptable experience on both outbound and return flights. Both delayed with no explanation or even an apology. Flights are useless if not on time. Delta going down hill - look for alternatives."
"""rude and short with me""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the last time I’m flying with Delta. I’ve always supported this airline, I have for years, but from now on I’m taking my business elsewhere. Completely unhelpful, every single employee was rude and short with me. Not only with me but with everyone else as well. Flying out of Orlando can be hard I understand that but that’s no excuse to treat people disrespectfully. Also everyone on the plane is paying an arm and a leg to where they need to be."
"""luggage was missing from her flight""","Not Verified | New York to Paris. I purchased three tickets for my mother and my daughters to travel to Paris together for the month of July since I was already in the city for my Master's program. My children checked-in with my brother who was going to Paris for the week since they arrived at the same time. When my mother arrived at check-in, she wasn't able to because the Delta agents in New York had put her name on my brother's luggage. My brother and daughters checked in around 6:30 PM and my mother didn't get to the airport until almost 8:00 PM to check-in for the same flight. The only thing they have in common is the same last name. The solution proposed by Delta was that she pay $100 to check-in her 1 bag as a second piece of luggage or have my brother come back out from the terminal so they could ""try to fix it"". Once you go through security, you can't come back out to the check-in counter. How do you ask someone to pay extra for your own incompetence and negligence? When you issue a baggage label you are looking at the passport, the boarding pass and the person in front of you. That's an extra level of incompetence on the part of Delta which makes me question their level of security. After their mistake, they gave my mother the run-around for over 30-minutes, then they told her that she wasn't able to check-in anymore because check-in stops one hour before boarding. There were a ton of agents just hanging around at the counters and no other customers. While they are saying this, my children and brother are texting me that the flight has been delayed and they are waiting at the terminal for an update. Then, Delta proposed that the only thing she could do was either re-book with them for a different flight on a different day and she would have to pay for the re-booking. Then they stated that they couldn't do anything because the ticket was purchased with a travel agency. After speaking to different Delta representatives and supervisors, through some ""miracle"", one of them rebooked her for a direct flight with Air France. She arrived in Paris 8 hours before my children and brother which was a major inconvenience. When all was done, my mother's luggage was missing from her flight with Air France as well as my brothers' from his flight. My children' pieces of luggage arrived one after the other on the conveyer belt. It's suspect that the two pieces of luggage missing happen to be the ones with my mother's name on them. So far, my brother's luggage was delivered the day after they arrived, but my mothers' has not yet been delivered. As of today July 6th (4 days after arrival), we were informed by Air France that they never received a marked bag for her from Delta and that her luggage is likely still in New York. They think that the baggage tag was ""probably removed"" from the suitcase which is why it never made it on the next direct flight. She's suffering from severe chronic asthma and diabetes because her extra medication was in her luggage. Now we're in Paris, she struggled to get around the past few days and had to be taken to the emergency room by ambulance today. As someone who travels every year, I will do my best to ensure that those whom I know don't travel with Delta and that I don't take a flight associated with Delta again."
"""child sit 15 rows away from you""","✅ Trip Verified | Puerto Vallarta to Bosto via Atlanta. Booked with Delta in advance. Delta indicated the seat assignment would be available at the gate. It was. I was informed at the gate my young child would be seated 15 rows away from me. Would you let your young child sit 15 rows away from you. Never booking with Delta again. I would have paid more if I was aware they would attempt to place my young child 15 rows away from me."
"""The flight was comfortable""","Not Verified | We had a stopover in Atlanta from PBI to LAX. 1hr 45 minutes. After boarding the plane they changed our seat, the plane changed. We arrived in LAX and no luggage. We were told where to pick it up, waited a half our and went to claim agent. She told us to walk to terminal 2 from 3. NO luggage, claim agent kept telling us it's coming, 2.5 hours later, he finally realized we were not getting the luggage and filed a claim. We were charged UBER cancellation fee waiting. Flight arrived 8:46. We were picked up by Uber around midnight. Luggage was delivered next morning around 11:30. The flight was comfortable, plenty of leg room, TV worked most of the time."
"""A321 was very nice indeed""","Not Verified | Traveled on paid first from Atlanta to Austin. New A321 aircraft was very nice indeed. Pre departure beverages and another few rounds once airborne. I'm really not fan of the snack basket, but at least it's something. Delta really has made strides with its boarding process and empowering its employees. It really shows. Thank god for Sky Priority. Atlanta's TSA check point lines seemed to stretch for ever."
"""they just want your money""","Not Verified | Where do I even begin with my nightmare of a flight. On our ride to Orlando from LaGuardia we had a nine hour layover due to the incompetence of the Delta staff. After our original flight was delayed and we missed our connection we were put on the waiting list first. They told us there was no room for us and proceeded to board the people after us on the list. When we got to Orlando Delta lost one of our fellow passengers luggage and said “whoops we’ll see if we can send it to your house later”, the lady whose luggage was lost was in tears and the Deltas employees flippant attitude made it worse. Delta had to cancel a flight to Georgia due to the weather in LaGuardia even though other flights were still taking off. Because they blaimed weather that affected no other flights the people whose flights were cancelled were not compensated. The gate changes are almost impossible to keep up with too. As I write this horrible review I am waiting for a flight that has yet again been delayed last minute. I lost a day at Disney due to Deltas incompetence. Here is my parting advice Delta does not care about you they just want your money they will lie to you and cheat you and swindle you because in the end they know you’ll come back if the flights are cheap enough. Its an air plane menopoly and they will never ever be honest with you. The only minor source of joy is a small TV with no volume."
"""does not care about its customers""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Tulsa via Atlanta. Boston to Atlanta on Wednesday, June 12, 2019 leaving Boston at 6:24 pm and scheduled to arrive at 9:20 pm. The connecting flight was Atlanta to Tulsa (where I live) scheduled to depart at 10:08 pm. The flight from Boston was a little delayed and landed at 10:32 but taxied another seven minutes. We knew our connection was tight but no flight attendants helped. It used to be that they would announce close connections, allow those people to get off first. Not here. We were at the back of the plane and didn't de-board until 10:44. We had twenty-four min to make our connection in another part of airport. I asked gate attendant to call ahead and let them know we were coming. He shook his head no and we started at a dead run. Me and family (four of us) We made it there at 10:58. The gate was closed. They closed a full 15 min early, knowing they had a close-connecting flight. A couple there who were in the front of our plane arrived two min earlier than we did. The gate was not closed because it's ""regulation"" to close 15 min prior to take off. It closed 15 mins prior to take-off to board their standby employees. That's what I was later told. I would like proof of this but don't have it. Delta has it. The next morning June 13 we took a flight (DL3467) to Tulsa departing at 8:25. It closed its gate at 8:21. Four minutes prior to take-off. So it is not a regulation. Six people I know of missed the flight the night before because Delta breached our contract and inflicted emotional distress in order to further their own causes by boarding their own people. When we went to customer service that night, they refused to pay for the hotel because the plane was ""not that late."" They blamed us for missing the flight. I told them that was unacceptable and they finally made a call and okayed ours and everyone's overnight stay (found this out later on bus to hotel). A side note: on June 7 fight DL1846 leaving Tulsa at 6:42 to Atlanta then Boston we also missed the connecting flight in Atlanta due to mechanical issues which I understand. But we spent the night sleeping on airport chairs. No apologies, no offer of pillows, no offer of blankets, etc. Delta is unfriendly and does not care about its customers. Once they take your money, they don't care. I answered their survey re these flights and asked for a manager at Delta to call me. I've heard nothing."
"""I am very disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Columbus. I am a regular customer of Delta and I am very disappointed. Every time I fly the flight gets delayed, sometimes for maintenance issue, sometimes system problem and sometimes the plane itself gets delayed. Last time my both ways flight got delayed and it was delayed yesterday as well and is delayed even now for hours. This is very disappointing and i will try not to use this plane again in future."
"""commend their customer service""","Not Verified | Grand Cayman to Salt Lake City via Atlanta. I am writing this review to recommend Delta and commend them for their customer service in a difficult situation. Due to weather, we missed our connection in Atlanta. The following day our flight was then cancelled due to mechanical issues. Delta customer service was excellent in providing accommodations and ensuring that we were still satisfied with Delta by the end of the trip. What could have been a terrible situation was handled very well and we will continue to recommend and fly with Delta."
"""My bag was mis-tagged""","✅ Trip Verified | Providence to Miami. My bag was mis-tagged and sent to Augusta. We kept being told by Delta that this was impossible and they do not know how it happened. We were flying down to Miami for a cruise that left the next day. We went to the Delta lost luggage counter when we arrived in Miami and were told my bag was re tagged and would arrive to us by 11pm that night at our hotel. I woke up at 9am the next day and no bag had been delivered. We were boarding our cruise boat at 2pm and i had no belongings. The bag arrived 30 minutes later but it was not my bag. It is assumed that this was the bag of the man which my bag was mistagged under. It was easter so we could not even go to a clothing store to get any clothes since everything was closed . Our two vacation days in Miami prior to the cruise were ruined. We had to waste time at the bag counter and stop at stores to get belongings instead of enjoying our trip. We spent the two days on and off the phone with Delta. Luckily the bag arrived right before the cruise boat left. They did reimburse us for belongings we had to buy prior to getting on the boat which is appreciated, but does not fix the fact that they ruined part of my trip. I feel that mistagging my bag with a different persons name is a huge mistake. If that guy or someone else took my bag I would have never seen it again. I emailed Delta to speak with them about the matter twice and they have not even acknowledged my email."
"""was absolutely horrific""","✅ Trip Verified | My experience with Delta Airlines was absolutely horrific and will be something I remember from my most recent trip for the rest of my life. My flight schedule was as follows, DFW->DTW->ORD (with Delta) -> BCN (Norwegian) My flight out of DFW was scheduled to depart to DTW at 7:15 AM. Due to ""technical difficulties,"" we sat boarded for two hours in the terminal. Finally, the airline crew then decided to restart the plane -literally turned it off, and turned it back on- and the issue resolved itself. This was not reassuring, as the pilot seemed to have a legitimate safety concern with the plane. It was also frustrating that it took them two hours to come to this solution. It goes without saying, I missed my connection from DTW to ORD due to this delay. The next flight out of DTW to ORD was at 3:55 which made it extremely close to missing the check-in deadline for my international flight with Norwegian at 6:30. Nevertheless, I was determined to make it work, so I got in the Delta Customer Service queue to make the arrangements. To preface this, the woman behind me in line had the exact same flight itinerary as me, so we were in the same dispositions. When I reached the counter they told me that there were no available seats at this time and that I would have to fly standby for the 3:55 flight and gave me a ticket for the 5:07 flight out of DTW - which would most definitely make me miss my international flight. I pleaded, nearly in tears, for her to do anything to help me as my flight with Norwegian was non-refundable. Unempathetically, she explained there was nothing she could do. After the line, I went to the restroom to catch my breath and met back up with the lady behind me to see what she was going to do. To my disgust and surprise, the same staff gave her a flight on the 3:55 PM seconds after she told me there was nothing she could do. After I heard this, I got back in line and she conveniently found me a spot on the 3:55 PM flight. Once again, the flight was delayed for various reasons- one time they said technical and the other was the weather. I approached a different help desk, as now I 100% was going to miss my flight, and I was serviced by a different Delta employee (I did not catch her name but I wish I did). She proceeded to yell at me to the point I had to ask her to, ""Please, stop yelling at me."" She responded in a yelling voice, ""I am not yelling at you, just give me your ticket!"" This reduced me to tears of frustration and humiliation. When I boarded the plane, which was a full flight, I was looking for a space to put my carry-on in an overhead bin. The flight attendant, quite rudely said, ""Can you not see that these are closed? It means they are full."" Rather than offering help to a visibly upset individual she made me feel stupid and unwelcome. Because Delta is not affiliated with Norwegian , they could not help me rebook my international flight and I lost my money on the ticket, a day of my vacation, and multiple tours and bookings due to multiple issues on Delta's part. I am disgusted by the lack of customer service."
"""force me to check my baggage""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Brussels. I paid for Comfort+ seat which includes extra legroom and dedicated overhead bin space. My connecting flight (DL140 to Brussels) said that I have to check my carry-on baggage because the flight is too full. I am very upset that Delta would put other personal luggage in my overhead bin that I paid for. Then force me to check my baggage. It was such an inconvenience to take out my work and personal laptop.The staff members were very unprofessional and discriminated against me because of my skin color. I never like flying from New York, but I had no choice. I will never fly out New York again. Flying from Atlanta is more convenient and the Delta Staff members are friendly. Something has to done about this. It’s not fair to those who paid extra in order to avoid circumstances like this."
"""Boarding was a mess""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew Montreal to Minneapolis with Delta both ways. The last of the great the three great American airlines I fly with. Boarding was a mess: there were so many different classes, it gets confusing. Also, people are called out for a boarding class that does not match what is written on the boarding pass (e. g. ""basic"" can be ""main""). And with two flights boarding at very close times, in such a tiny space, it got very confused to know who was being called for boarding, as the staff kept on talking one after the other (in Montreal) or kept on passing information one over the other (in Minneapolis). Some seats are assigned at the boarding stage. Had never seen this one and it seems an extra unnecessary step. Service on board could see some more smiling and some less mobile fun by some of the staff, in some cases."
"""The service was stiffer than the chairs""","✅ Trip Verified | 100% not recommend. We were scheduled to fly to New York and then fly to Orlando Florida. We arrived at the airport at 3.00 in the morning because we were not notified our flight was delayed. The lady at the desk rescheduled our flight. Needless to say she messed up our connection flights. Luckily we caught her mistake and we attempted to fix it. It took a half hour of bantering with another Delta employee before we finally correctly rescheduled our flight. We spent 7 hours waiting for that flight. We were not compensated and I was left feeling like Delta did not care about me or any of my fellow passengers. I missed a day at Disney our vacation destination. The service was stiffer than the chairs."
"""Words can't express my disgust""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Sydney via Los Angeles. Words can't express my disgust at Delta but I will try! Traveling with a young child (age 1) is never pleasant. On the first leg of the flight, Delta did not have any bassinets so the baby sat on my knee for 7 hours. On the second leg, we were told we would have one bassinet. We did not. They told us we would have a spare seat at least. We did not. An upset family took the spare seat after they too had been screwed around by Delta. Staff admitted that we had been lied to on several occasions. All staff, bar one, were rude and just couldn't care. Delta just don't care. After 23 hours with a baby on my lap, no sleep and terrible food - I promised I would do something to balance the world back out by leaving this review and telling people to pay the extra $30 to go with a proper airline. We both received a $50 apology voucher but have no intention of ever flying Delta again."
"""Hours spent wasted in airports""","Not Verified | Peoria to Atlanta via Daytona. Horrible. Never again. Every time we have used Delta they have cancelled or moved flights. Huge delays. Hours spent wasted in airports instead of being on vacation. No customer service. Automated phone says two hour wait for a response. Another trip we had to spend an extra night at a hotel stranded in a strange town. Never ever again. They do not care E and offer no help or compensation for wrecking your vacation plans. No customer service response."
"""extremely polite and accommodating""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Dallas. Delta is a real airline unlike Spirit and Frontier. They offer customer service and pretty quality amenities. They overbooked my flight and they offered a reward for switching to another. The person at the flight desk was extremely polite and accommodating."
"""Worst experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Eugene to Seattle. Worst experience ever. I will never fly Delta again. I showed up at the airport at 1 PM for a flight leaving at 5:06pm. I was told by the lady at the gate that the earliest I could check in will be 4 hours prior to departure. Then I replied oh that works then since it's 1pm so I'm in the 4 hours window. She then says, no you can't check in because our gate is not opened yet and I'm like ""didn't you just said I could check in 4 hours prior"" she then says no I should come back at 3pm that's the earliest time they would open. She just contradicted herself right there. I left , checked in online,paid my bag then showed up 4:25pm which was 40min prior to departure and was told they can't take my paid bag even though I checked it online after they refused to check me in 4hours before. I was then provided a number to call and the person I spoke with, told me they can't do anything and I would have to talk to the agents at the airport which is odd because the agent told me to call you. Now time to board , I'm told they have to check in my carry on (my bag was already gone because they wouldn't take it) and I told them I don't feel comfortable checking in my carry on because I had things stolen before and I have my laptop and they replied ""you don't want to check it, you won't board""."
"""Poor operations management""","Not Verified | Poor operations management. EWR to ATL leg was delayed by 4.5 hours, really? Missed connecting flight to MSY. It was the last flight of the night, so I wandered around ATL airport overnight until the first flight of the morning to MSY the next day. On the return, flight from ATL to EWR was delayed by about an hour, not too bad, but still a bit inconvenient. Ground staff in EWR and MSY were friendly, not so much in ATL. Cabin crew on 3 of the 4 flights were lovely. Tasty snacks and drinks included in the ticket. I wouldn't recommend Delta, they don't seem to have much respect for the passenger's time."
"""I would have drove""","Not Verified | Seattle to Boise. Supposed to leave for Boise at 7:50. Got to the gate at 7:35. All the arrival/departure gate screens were not working or off. They had moved our flight to the other side of the airport with no warning. They made no announcements, and the lady that was making announcements at that gate spoke only broken English. Got a new flight booked for 12:50. So after sitting in the airport terminal for almost five hours, the dirtiest, most haggard airplane I've ever seen shows up at the terminal. We board and the captain comes over the intercom. He warns us that the APU is not working properly, and they cannot put cold air into the cabin, or start the main engines. We wait for a start cart. After cooking in the plane for half an hour while they wait, they tell us to go back to the terminal. If I had known I was going to go through this, I would have drove. I would have been there already. Now I'm sitting in the terminal still."
"""Thank you Delta""","Not Verified | Minneapolis to London. My daughter was to get a flight to London at 5:44pm and missed the luggage cut off time and she couldn't board. I called a number that i thought was Delta and they upcharged me $538 and told me she would be on the 7 pm flight guaranteed and needed to process it quickly as we had 15 min for her to board, me frantic paid for it to get her on which didn't happen. So here is my daughter a mess at the airport no flight. I contacted several people at Delta whom were all pleasant to speak with and trying to be very helpful the whole process. After being on hold and different people it was now 11 pm and couldn't do anything more. Next morning 6:30 Am called and spoke with a Jack in Dallas, who took the situation and quickly helped me place my daughter on the next direct flight to London. No up charge and excellent service. I cannot express how much his professional Customer Service Helped me! Thank you Delta, keep Good People like you have!!!"
"""no one seemed to care!""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to San Juan. My husband is on Kidney dialysis and we must travel with a portable dialysis machine which cannot be checked in it must be checked and hate to stay with him at all times. We label the machine in lime green duct tape with large letters stating it’s a medical device. This machine was pink tagged by Delta as well meaning it cannot go on a luggage carousel. We traveled from Atlanta to Puerto Rico on June 7th. When we landed our machine was not waiting on us to deboard the flight. We were told that the device had been thrown into the carousel. This is a $4000 machine and a life or death device for my husband and they overlooked the markings and tags and just threw on the carousel. They did realize their mistake and radioed the luggage department. However they did not advise us of any of this. We spent 20 minutes looking for the machine on the carousel. I finally decided to look for someone and found the luggage office. Our device was in the office!! This special $500 car that transports it was damaged luckily the machine was not. When a complaint was made the pulled the pink tagged marked by Delta it was under the wrong name!! Had this luggage been lost we would have never been able to get it back. What really saddens us is no one seemed to care! You’re supposed to be the friendly sky! Shame on you Delta! Educate your employees!"
"""return flight was awesome""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta Airlines AMS to DTW: I left a review on the reverse route where the flight attendant for DTW to AMS in Business class could not make drinks. Well the return flight was awesome. Flight Attendant went out of her way to keep checking up on me during the flight even though she didn't have to. Also I finally got to have the Delta signature Cocktail as the flight attendant knew how to make it. She even went out of her way to make it from scratch and not pouring it out of the pre made bottle that is loaded from the catering kitchen. The cocktail was refeshing, and the meal service was good as well. Everything is was the usual Delta service for transatlantic service. Overall a great experience and flight back home after a good vacation."
"""make sure your cabin crew is fully trained""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta Airlines Business class from DTW to AMS. The usual service which was good in Business class meals and service prompt. However the drink service was awful because the flight attendant working my side of the plane did not know how to make drinks and she even mentioned she did not drink so did not know how much of what gets mixed. I was shocked as frequent flyer who travels Business Class for international travel with a variety of airlines. At this point I am wondering how Delta allowed this person to pass the needed classes and training given. She did not know how to make Delta's signature cocktail which is highlighted in the menu card given. So much for the cocktail that Delta raves about. I ended up having to take a coke zero twice. Fastforward to morning time about six hours later before landing at AMS. The same person is working my side this time she walks by for breakfast I ask for Coffee and she has to move the cart as to others wanting to use the bathroom and then totally forgets to serve us breakfast. I even brought it to her attention but she did not care. ThankfulIy I was not hungry. If anyone from Delta actually reads this make sure your cabin crew is fully trained for International flights more so for Business class service."
"""Staff showed zero empathy""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrendous travel experience with Delta Air Lines, was supposed to depart from Tampa at 12.15 pm and land in LaGuardia at 3.00 pm, instead the plane ran out of fuel / the pilot legally couldn’t fly anymore / LaGuardia was closed (kept giving us different excuses) so we landed in Syracuse at 6.00 pm. We were told a new flight would arrive at 7.15 pm that got pushed to 9.56 pm then cancelled altogether. Rebooked for 6.20 am today and I wasn’t able to check in online, was not told the slip I was given wasn’t a boarding pass so by the time I went through TSA and was told to go downstairs, I was too late to checkin. The self service machine upstairs was broken. Staff showed zero empathy and made no effort to help. The employee took immense pleasure in calling the supervisor asking if I could late check in but failing to mention everything that happened to me yesterday, framing it so it sounded like it was completely my fault. I have clinically bad anxiety and now I am traumatized from this experience."
"""nice and enjoyable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Mexico via Atlanta. Because of bad reviews I was a bid worried about my flight with Delta. But in the end it was a nice and enjoyable flight. The check in and the transfer in Atlanta worked out fine. I was a bit surprise how long the boarding takes, because of all the small groups being called to get to the gate. That explains why I have to be at the gate so early. But how cares as long as it works. The flight attendants were very nice and helpful. It was a lot of fun to chat with them. They were great and very professional. Although we should not forget that they are on the flight for safety reasons and not only as waitresses and waiters. But I have my doubts that the age group of flight attendants during my flight is still able to do that. One flight attendant stumbled twice over a slight step on the floor. After so many years that should not happen any more. To make sure, it is not about youth and beauty, this is about safety. The service was excellent the food was fine and nothing to complain. The WiFi during the flight just for messages was amazing. I spend a lot of time by sending messages around the world. The seat was really old and not very comfortable. The length is okay but the width did not work at all. I was sorry that the new seats were not available. A big plus for me was the matter that my luggage could get through to Mexico. It is always a horror to pick up the luggage and drop it of again 5 seconds later. Finally it was a nice and smooth flight and if I have to fly with Delta again I will look forward to it."
"""turned into a 16 hour nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | Fort Myers to Pittsburgh via Atlanta turned into a 16 hour nightmare and is still going. Worst part? We have our infant with us. We arrived at the Ft. Meyers airport 2 hours early as expected and found that our 6pm flight had been delayed multiple times. Once we got through the sea of people waiting for rebookings Delta told us to take a 10p flight to ATL and they would provide a hotel voucher when we landed so we had a place to stay until our 7am. We landed at midnight, grabbed our checked luggage and looked for the Delta desk to receive such voucher only to find a 2 hour line in front of us. Three associates working and all their monitors turned off. Word spread through the line that there were no hotel vouchers to be given and that multiple new flights were delayed. Completely baffled, concerned and infuriated my husband waited in the two hour line to check our suitcases and to figure out our next step. Suddenly as he approached the desk 2 hours later they announced that they were not accepting any more checked bags until 4:30am. We wasted 2 hours in this line for absolutely nothing. They didn't offer us anything and said that there was nothing for us to do so we are sitting in the middle of the ATL airport with an infant, stroller, carseat, and two suitcases due to no communication, no organization, and ""customer service"" built on lies."
"""Lost my flight""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Fort Lauderdale via Atlanta. I’ve tried to do the check in one day before. However, I’ve a surfboard and apparently this pathetic company can’t check in surfboards by the website. Was in the counter 40 minutes before my domestic flight and they told me that 45 minutes before the flight they close the luggage check in. Lost my flight. Luckily my other flight it’s two days after but miss the chance to spend time with my family that I don’t see for more than 20 years."
"""4.5 hours to find a pilot""","Not Verified | Raleigh to Salt Lake City. My flight was supposed to leave at 5 it’s currently 9:15 and boarding hasn’t begun. The plane we’ve needed to take has been parked in the terminal since we’ve gotten here the reason we haven’t left yet is because are pilot isn’t here yet. It’s disappointing that it takes at the very least 4.5 hours to find a pilot to fly a plane I give delta a 1/10."
"""never be using Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Boston. This is the third consecutive Delta flight where we were delayed. This time was particularly egregious. Morning of, flight was delayed from 8 to 12. Not ideal, but at least we knew the night before. Then, 1o minutes before boarding, flight is delayed another 4 hours! And then there was not contextual information given about what was the issue or when it would be resolved, only that they were “working on a replacement crew”. We missed an important family event (graduation) but also wasted a day in the airport waiting (we could have been working or spending time with our kids!). Then, when I call customer service, they offer us a $25 voucher! That’s just a complete insult. I would rather spend the next 5 hours in the airport writing negative reviews than accept $25. I will never be using Delta again and recommending all my family (delta users) switch airlines to a company that knows basic customer service."
"""got attitude from everybody""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Orlando via Atlanta. First they claim we would not be able to catch our flight in Minneapolis and would have to stay, a nightmare. When we told them it was unacceptable after an hour or so they finally found a flight connecting to Atlanta, first class that we paid for however not sitting together. No one apologized, we got attitude from everybody. Horrible experience. Do not think we will ever fly them again - we were not offered any compensation for anything for the very stressful morning."
"""flight is 1.45 hrs delayed""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Amsterdam. I listed my phone number for notifications about my flight. I did not get any (still none) although my flight is 1.45 hrs delayed. I could have used that time to stay longer in downtown Seattle. But of course, delays happen. However when I asked why I wasn’t notified and if you get a voucher they kept on sending me to another desk. First they blamed KLM as they are partnering. However it was their website I had to use to check in. I queued up for 3 times and constantly hearing I was not at the right location. In the end they send me to the gate. But of course no one was there as it was 4hrs for departure. Nicely done Delta, just guide your passengers to another desk until there is no one left to ask what happened or in the end complain to. I would train your ground staff differently."
"""I missed my connecting flight""","Not Verified | Flight crew and Delta Air Line employees have been lying about the arrival of our “pilot”. We boarded the plane on time, and for 40 minutes just had us sitting there to then tell us we were deplaning and waiting for the pilot that was due to arrive by 10:55am and we should be back on the plane. At 11am, we are then notified that we will not be boarding again till 12:30pm. Shortly after that, someone came on the intercom to inform us that the “pilot” was stuck in South Carolina and would not be in till 1:15pm. Which doesn’t seem to make any sense. The constant delays. And then due to weather issues, I missed my connecting flight because my first flight was delayed by an hour, and missed the connecting flight by 5 minutes."
"""crews pleasant and professional""","✅ Trip Verified | St Maarten to Raleigh Durham via Atlanta. Actually flew in all classes on this trip: Comfort + to Atlanta, economy to St. Martin and First Class on both legs of the return trip home. All flights were on time and cabin crews pleasant and professional. Gate attendants were efficient and boarding went well for all four flights. Gate attendant in Atlanta on the outbound leg was particularly nice and helpful to those flying with young children. Snacks and drinks in all cabins and lunch on the mid-day flight from St. Martin in First Class. Everything went smoothly. Quite a bit of turbulence out of St. Martin but the pilot had provided some advance info and kept passengers informed so not really stressful. Check-in at St. Martin took longer than anticipated as there are no kiosks set up (and the airport still shows signs of hurricane damage) so had a queue to contend with but was still handled well."
"""Staff were fairly attentive""","Not Verified | San Francisco to New York with Delta Air Lines. Excellent quick check in, flew comfort plus. Supposed to have dedicated bins for hand luggage but bin was nearly full when we got there. Seatback entertainment excellent but had to wait for headphones. Staff were fairly attentive and captain made a great landing in poor weather. Negatives were poor quality of tannoy system messages, impossible to hear and poor quality of cold breakfast and snack and poor condition of toilet."
"""stranded without our luggage""","Not Verified | We flew from Anchorage to Atlanta and our bags were sent to Columbus Ohio, when we arrived we talked to every customer service desk in the entire airport and received nothing but disrespect and false information from the staff. We are now stranded without our luggage and Delta refuses to help, I will never be flying with delta again."
"""poorest customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | La Guardia to Indianapolis. Not A great way to end your vacation to come to an airport with the poorest customer service. We got to the airport around 2 our flight was to be boarded at 5:45. The flight has been delayed 7 times and when the plane finally landed it was given to Pittsburgh and we were told to go on the opposite side of the airport. Now our boarding “promised time” is 12:30 AM. We’ve tried talking to the attendants and they were all rude granted none of them could give us a straight answer. We spent $60 on food at the airport today. No vouchers were given and everyone on the Indianapolis plane were left clueless waiting. We could have booked different flights or stayed and enjoyed our time in the city."
"""I was treated with hostility""","✅ Trip Verified | My baggage was delayed and when I talked with Delta at the airport I was at first treated rudely and dismissed with no help. When I returned for additional assistance, I was treated with hostility and when I expressed that I had health problems and could not go on any more wild goose chases in the airport and needed their assistance they threatened to call a paramedic. This was not out of concern but expressed rudely basically saying if you don’t shut up we will call a paramedic to come get you. I was clearly frustrated but I was not yelling or cussing as other customers were. I just needed help with locating my bag. I was so shocked and appalled by how I was treated by Delta."
"""they couldn’t locate my bag""","Not Verified | I lost my luggage on on Delta Airlines and they did not do anything about it. I boarded the flight from Amsterdam to Atlanta and Atlanta to DFW, when I arrived DFW, they couldn’t locate my bag and they put I call to Atlanta and it was confirmed that the bag was at Atlanta and that the next flight to DFW will bring it. I waited for 5 hours the bag did not show up, they asked me to go that they will deliver the bag to my house in Wichita Falls. I kept on calling for the bag and it was from one story to another. They gave me a tracking number to track the luggage but after 3 weeks that the luggage did not show up, I called them and they told me that the luggage was missing. I filled claims which they refused to pay and referred me to UPS and UPS told that I should call Delta. After series of calls , Delta blocked my line and I couldn’t reach them anymore and after 5 months I still have not received my luggage. Just avoid them if you can because they don’t value their customers neither are organized."
"""absolute worst experience""","✅ Trip Verified | The absolute worst experience flying ever. I fly very often and this has been terrible. The flight from Sydney was delayed causing me to miss my connection to Washington DC. They were only able to get me on a flight 4 hours later getting me into DC at midnight versus 4:30 with a stopover in Atlanta. Customer service is not helpful and infuriating. Never will I fly delta again."
"""the day was ruined""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Honolulu. 4 hours delay due to gas refill is ridiculous, you know that there’s a flight and passengers will be onboard why not do it first hand? We are very disappointed. To all passengers it’s always good to check the review of the airline before considering buying a ticket to avoid any hassle. Our whole plan for the day was ruined, I don’t think we will consider this airline ever again."
"""my baggage is in ATL""","✅ Trip Verified | I dont want to be as extreme as others and claim that Delta is the worst ever. However I have only flown with Delta a handful of times, and 2 out of the 3 or 4 times they lost my luggage by trying to check my carry on at the gate. I flew from Texas for my grandmother 75th surprise birthday party, but my luggage is in ATL. This is completely irresponsible and now I have nothing. Once I got to Atlanta they said my luggage was in baggage claim but it was suppose to follow me to Baltimore. Now I see why others were reluctant to check their carry ons at the gate. Customer service promised this would be resolved and my luggage would meet me in Baltimore after she ""rechecked it"". I'm not sure what that means but she was trying to help. I've called customer service this morning for an update on my luggage but I was on hold, and then got hung up on so now I'm on hold for another 18 mins and my grandmother's event starts in 4 hours. Not to mention that when I asked for a supervisor the woman said she was a manager and hung up on me. I have to rebuy everything! I dont even have a toothbrush or underwear for I dont know how long. I go back to Texas tomorrow and my baggage is in ATL. I regret buying this flight because I'm now a sitting duck with nothing. I dont think you all are a bad airline at all, but this is unacceptable and very expensive on my part."
"""worst, most unorganized flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Kona to Seattle. The worst, most unorganized flight I've ever been on. Overbooked, had to check my carry, then went i was in my set for twenty minutes they moved me right next to a screaming child. So much for a relaxing vacation in Paradise."
"""consistently the worst airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to San Francisco. Delta Airlines never fails to disappoint. It is not only the worst airline, but consistently the worst airline and customer service that I have ever experienced. I missed my connection flight due to “weather” which they used as an excuse to not pay for a hotel room. Customer service was beyond rude and unhelpful and my overall travel with Delta cost me an extra $400 dollars beyond the ticket price. I would highly recommend that no one flies Delta and it is a shock that they are still in business with their lack of customer service and overall human decency."
"""poor service provided""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew for the first time on Delta Airlines and will surely be the last. On 21 May 2019 I traveled from Lisbon to Indianapolis via JFK and returned to Lisbon via Boston on May 28, 2019. On four flights there were 3 delays all for technical and mechanical reasons, which leaves me worried about the quality and maintenance of yours aircrafts One of the delays was more than three hours almost compromising the connecting flight to Lisbon and at this moment I am in Boston waiting to board again for mechanical reasons without being served a simple bottle of water. The flight at this time is already delayed 30 minutes and is expected to depart more than one hour late. Inadmissible, mainly because it is happening for the third time in three consecutive flights and in the same airline. Added to this is the fact that I have always been allocated seats in the tail of the planes on all flights when I requested an upgrade when booking and upon check-in. As a result of the assigned places I was left with no menu option once the option of meat was finished at lunch on the first intercontinental flight and on another flight, that of the three-hour delay, due to the host's incompetence, we were not served the drink at that we were entitled and for which we paid for ""lack of time"" Let's see what reserves this flight ... I must also express my displeasure at the approach of your collaborators at Lisbon Airport prior to check-in. I have often traveled to the USA on other airlines and such approach has never been done. Even a sticker put in the passport what is illegal when done by people without the authority to do so. I thought it was abusive. I also hate your way of managing boarding on the planes that I consider very complicated. The competitive rates do not compensate for the poor service provided, the lack of care and consideration for the passengers you sit in the last places of the plane."
"""Not worth it""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline I’ve ever flown and will never use Delta Air Lines again. Flew Boston to Fort Lauderdale. Delayed flight over three hours both ways with awful service. The could not care less about their customers time constraints or plans. Don’t fly Delta if you can fly another airline for more money. Not worth it."
"""Great customer service""","Not Verified | I really want to take the time to say thank you very much to all of the Delta team. Great customer service, I still cannot believe what they have done for my friend and I. Long weekend in NYC, we got confused and went to the wrong airport resulting and missing our flight. We got at the JFK airport 40 minutes before the departure time. Even though we didn’t have any bags to check in, and the staff tried their best, it was impossible... we were too late. They were concerned and helpful getting us into the next fly available right the way. The supervisor Charlie went above and beyond any kind of customer service experience I ever had in any airline. He even suggests us to stay in Hotel near by the airport giving us directions and helping us to book a room."
"""never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | St Louis to Orlando via Atlanta. Delta is the absolute worst. The last time I flew delta before this was almost 10 years ago and my experience was so traumatic and awful that I have intentionally not flown delta since; even in cases where it was $200+ for a different airline. I decided after 10 years I could give them another chance and once again it’s been an awful experience. The treatment from the employees was horrible, especially the gate agent. I will truly never fly Delta again."
"""Super slow, rude service""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Toronto. Super slow, rude service. Understaffed at the “unaccompanied minor” check in with incompetent staff. 3 hours early just isn’t enough when it takes 30 minutes per person to check in and drop bags."
"""Claustrophobic sums up the experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Calgary to Kona via Seattle. First leg to Seattle was fine. Quick flight regional aircraft quick friendly attendant. The Seattle Delta club was excellent.Great staff, great food and drink.Boarding the 757 to Kona, I thought I was imagining things. The first class section was actually pathetic. The amount of personal space and legroom was absolutely minimum.The attendants were incredible and offered great but unnecessarily rushed service for a 6 hour flight. They are the reason, the only reason to pay for a first class ticket and sit in a cattle car. The row ahead of me erupted into a screaming match because one of the party lost it when the guy in front reclined and she could no longer see her screen. Granted, she over reacted but this is how minimal the leg room was.Like coach ten years ago! Food was ok, drinks fine, entertainment good and wi fi worked well. Claustrophobic is not a word to be used when describing first class yet it sums up the experience."
"""No guidance or assistance""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Hibbing to Minneapolis was delayed by 2 hours. I would now be arriving in Minneapolis at 10:10, while my connecting flight to New York was also departing at 10:10. I called Delta and asked if they would hold the flight for me. The Delta employee looked up my reservation and told me that it was ok, since my connecting flight had been delayed by an hour and that my next connecting flight from New York to Rome was delayed by an hour and a half. So everything would be fine. I arrived in Minneapolis and find out my connecting flight left right on time. I called Delta again two more times to find out what happened. Both times the Delta employees simply hung up on me after looking up my reservation. No guidance or assistance, just plain rude."
"""horrendous customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft Lauderdale to San Francisco via Atlanta. Absolutely horrendous customer service! Will avoid flying though ATL, especially Delta airlines at all costs! I would leave less than zero stars if I could. My boyfriend had a tight connecting flight, made it to the Delta gate in ATL 15 minutes before his next flight (the exact time specified to arrive before gates closed) and they wouldn't let him on my next flight! They even dropped his seat on his next flight as he was standing in front of them. His next flight was delayed 15 minutes so then he had to sit and watch his next flight standstill while he was treated with disrespect by the most unhelpful and rude people at the Delta terminal. And the best part? They offered him a discounted hotel (not even a free hotel stay!), no food, and no vouchers! I also called ATL to get in touch with a Delta representative and not only did they have me wait 2x longer on hold on the phone just to reach a representative, but finally once I was able to speak with a representative they said ""hmm that's strange, looks like his first flight landed 30 minutes before his next flight was scheduled to depart and his second flight was delayed 15 minutes so he had time."" Truly unacceptable! The least the Delta folks could do is be nice under the circumstances given it was not his fault..."
"""delayed our trip by 30 hours""","✅ Trip Verified | Our party planned an entire family trip for 15 of us. The delayed our original flight. Two of our people were going to meet us in Minneapolis to have everyone fly overseas. Our group (10 of us) arrived at MSP 30 min late. The overseas aircraft refused to wait even though our other party was there. Then Delta refused to get us to our destination and delayed our entire trip by 30 hours because we were 30 minutes late due to a mechanical error. When we as individuals can see online there are seats available, however the airline tells us nothing is available for 3 days. Horrible service. Always getting pushed to someone else's problem."
"""made me purchase a new ticket""","✅ Trip Verified | Louisville to Minneapolis. Made it to my layover and had an emergency at home. Needed to head right back to my original location and not take the last leg of the flight. Delta made me purchase a brand new ticket for $500 instead of charging the $75 same day change fee."
"""went above and beyond""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta Airlines went above and beyond the required level of service for us. We stupidly missed our connecting flight with Mongolian Airlines from Seoul To Mongolia because we got confused with the local timezone and arrived at our gate 30 minutes after takeoff. We called up Delta Airlines and they were fantastic, they arranged for us to be on the next available flight at no cost to us. One of their representatives guided us to our new terminal and our luggage was found and re-directed to our new flight without any difficulties. Delta Airlines saved our trip from being a complete disaster and we are incredibly thankful for that."
"""damaged two of my bags""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight was fine, although the lady checking my bag in Charlotte was a little rude and the flight home was overly crowded so our family was not able to sit together. However, they damaged two of my bags. We didn't plan on checking the carry-ons but did so because the flight was full. But instead of getting the bags at the ramp on the next stop, the carry-ons went all the way to our destination. We were not informed that these were going all the way to our destination when we checked them at the gate, and they weren't locked. When we picked them up, one of the bags had the front pocket zippers completely ripped off so there is now no way to close the front pocket, and the other carry on had tire tread marks all over it. On the way back, the large suitcase I checked was split open on one corner. It looked like they just threw the bag which landed on the corner and caused it to split. The large bag was only a year old and used only one time. The carry-ons were brand new. They were not overstuffed so the only way they could have been damaged is by mishandling by the baggage crew. I didn't know the procedure for filing a claim for the bags the night we discovered the damage and I didn't show the bags to Delta when I was at the airport, so I am now not able to file a claim to get a reimbursement. Delta really has no respect for your personal property."
"""Very poor service""","❎ Not Verified | Brussels to Miami via Atlanta. The layover was too short for us to get through customs. Delta's answer is that customs is not their problem?! We had to pay extra and had a significant delay. Very poor service."
"""continues to impress""","✅ Trip Verified | South Bend to Detroit via New York. Delta continues to impress! On time departures and arrivals on this trip. Courteous in-flight crew. Clean aircraft. Pilots made timely announcements. Seats were a tad tight but entirely passable as was leg space - I had aisle seats. On the DTW-LGA route, the Airbus 320 had individual entertainment screens which in addition to a good selection of movies, TV shows, and music, also had a large variety of games (including chess). Head phones have to be bought for two dollars with a credit card. The screen also showed the flight path. In-flight service included, in addition to a variety of complimentary non-alcoholic beverages, a choice of snacks - cookies or Cheezit. Disembarking at the gates was quick. While changing at Detroit, I was very worried that I would miss the connection as I arrived at gate 2 in Terminal B and had to go to gate 75 in Terminal A. This would be among the longest of distances between two gates and I had only 37 minutes! My concerns were misplaced. I made it in good time. The flight between South Bend and Detroit does not offer any beverage service. Boarding on both flights went smoothly but with so many categories of passengers, airlines have finessed the system to a new high - and they implement it well! The disembarkation is less discriminatory - they start with the lowest numbered rows and go up. My recent travels with Delta have all been positive and the in-flight ambiance is pleasant and comfortable. Keep up the good work, Delta!"
"""Will never fly them again""","✅ Trip Verified | Bozeman to San Diego via Salt Lake City. Purchased two one-way flights on a single ticket purchase. Upon informing them I would not travel on the first leg, they told me the second leg (returning from a different city) would be cancelled. Delta said I would have to repurchase another ticket of the same route (even though I already have a paid return ticket) at an additional full one way fare. Will never fly them again."
"""a curt, rude attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | Washington to Salt Lake City. Every staff member we have interacted with today has a curt, rude attitude. Delta seems to have a negative company culture. Not only have they been rude to us but they are rude and unkind to each other. My husband was not given a seat assignment even though we checked in at the same time. At the gate he asked for a seat, but the staff were discourteous and bickering in front of him. ."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Miami. What an awful experience we had. I have purchased first class ticket on DL and paid fortune for it. In addition to that, DL charges $125 for pet in a cabin, which I happily paid. I took our small bird with us. Check-in staff was nice but flight attendant was worst possible, night mear that you cannot even imagine about. I was in a seat 3A, first thing she mention to other passenger next to me was “I have seen it all, but in 40 years I never experienced bird in a cabin” She was so nasty and so awful. She than asked what we wish to drink. I kindly ordered orange juice. Lady next to me got her water and my juice never arrived. Instead i got nasty looks every time she passed by. She was giving me terrible looks and passed by. Perhaps she hated guys with pets and hates everyone who is not up to her likings. She made sure I comply with a rule and place the bird under the seat, which is fine. She could at least be kind. I have never seen so much nastiness towards first class passengers We are returning to NY next week and will never fly Delta again. Congrats for hating your passengers Delta and well done on training your crew so well."
"""workers have such an attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Fort Walton via Atlanta, Attendant at check-in was extremely rude. When she finished informing me that I would not be able to fly without my pet due to extreme heat temperatures, I asked her when the next flight would be and she got extremely confrontational and asked me why I was interrupting her. I was so shocked I said, ""please finish,"" and she got an even worse attitude with me. I fully understand the flight regulations on pets with temperatures above 80F and simply asked when the next flight would be. I am active military and honestly would never select to fly with Delta again if it weren't for them accommodating military with pets. It's a shame their workers have such an attitude when asked simple questions."
"""I will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Raleigh via Orlando. Rules said one carry-on. I spent $60 to check in a bag smaller than most others carry-ons. Other people have two to three carry-ons that they are allowed to check at the gate and have waiting for them when they got off the plane for no charge. This was ridiculous, for this reason I will never fly Delta again."
"""I will never fly Delta again""","Not Verified | Our travels via Delta were very unsatisfactory - said we were too late to check luggage (unpublicized baggage check cut off), missed first leg. Then wouldn't give us the credit card free bag deal, but the kicker was that when I flew (separately) from Atlanta to Boston on a cheap seat, I knew I would be at the end of the line. OK. Got a seat assignment - surely middle - but as I was to board the gate person said 'wait, your seat has been changed' and gave me a piece of paper with the new seat. No big deal I thought. Went to rear of plane and had trouble finding my seat-window seat - a 300 lb woman was in the middle seat! I managed to get into my mouse trap seat, she was friendly, I was OK, but later I realized that my middle seat a few rows ahead had been taken-likely a window person decided not to be shoe horned into 'my seat' and sit next to this woman (she was a nice person and clearly knew she was a 'customer of size' but I didn't see any point of being unpleasant). But that Delta would regard me of having no merit-that they'd seize my seat for another 'higher ranking customer' is beyond belief. It was only a 2 hour flight to Boston but I would likely have had to wet my pants if I needed to get to the restroom-so impossible was it to get out of my mouse trap. I will never fly Delta again. First choice: Southwest, second Air Alaska, third Jet Blue. Legacy airlines like Delta and United are terrible today. Avoid them."
"""Delays, delays, delays""","✅ Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Atlanta. Delta used to be good but their service has completely deteriorated. Delays, delays, delays is all I have to say. Choose another airline. I'm strongly considering cancelling my credit card with them and moving to another more dependable airline. If I could give 0, I certainly would. And to add injury to insult they tried to upgrade me to first class on a Republic Airlines flight."
"""they ask us to check bags""","Not Verified | Atlanta to Missouri. Both of my flights were late going to and from my destinations, I almost missed my connecting flight. The seats are to small (while leg room is sufficient) the actual seat does not comfortably fit someone with adult hips. The wifi does not work on the plane, even after we are at 10,000 feet. The staff is rude, I understand that this job is stressful, but customer service requires a smile, a hello, and how may I help you. Not eye rolls and dismissive comments. Lastly, on every Delta flight I have ever been on they ask us to check bags, even though my bag is small enough to fit on the overhead. I understand it's to speed up the process, but Delta, you need to find another way because that is very inconvenient. I do not want to wait at baggage claim if I made the effort to pack light. We pay way to much for these tickets for this poor level of service."
"""stay away from Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Paris. This flight that I book for my son, I book through costumer service, and I was told that in the ticket is one check bag and one carry on, and $125 for the pet under the seat. When I received the email I saw that wasn’t the check in bag, I call back to make sure and they told me no its not showing but it’s included, and I ask for email confirmation. When I went in the airport with my son they told me no it’s not included, I paid $60 so my son can go in the flight and to travel, when I call they was tranfering me always, I was 45 minutes on the line, when my son went in Greece the bag wasn’t in the airplane, they said it’s Air France fault, they left in France, after 12 hours when he went to pick up the bag the bag was on delta flight. Very disappointed, very expensive flight and no responsible people, costumer service bad, airport arrogant people. This is not Delta used to be, stay away from Delta."
"""unbothered and nonchalant""","✅ Trip Verified | Greenville to Amsterdam via Atlanta. This has to be the worst airline ever. Super unprofessional, unbothered and nonchalant. We missed our international flights and little to nothing was done to ensure we were in good hands. Called the 855 number and the agents seemed to be in a rush to book us in whatever flight they could find, no seat number, no idea where our checked bags were as the “track my bags” section in the app doesn’t work. This was my first time flying Delta and I am never doing it again. I’m super, super mad!"
"""a horrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I booked a trip on Delta traveling from Atlanta to Milan via New York for a 9 day back country ski trip in the alps. The flight from ATL to NY was delayed over 2 hours leaving only 1 hour after landing in NY until the flight to Milan was taking off. I had 2 bags; one for skis and one for clothes and equipment. The skis made it onto the flight to Milan. The other bag did not. After arriving in Milan I was assured that the bag would arrive the next day and would be delivered to my hotel that was several hours away in the alps. The bag did arrive the next day to Milan, but it ended up held up in the airport for 3 days because the baggage company only delivers on Wednesday. By Wed, our group had moved to another country and needed the bag delivered to the new country. Trying to arrange for that with Delta was a complete waste of time after spending numerous hours on the phone with them. They never connected my bag to me for the entire 9 days that I was away. They ultimately delivered it to the wrong country. I had to track it down and pay someone to deliver it back to the airport at the end of the trip so that I would be reconnected with my clothes and equipment to go back home with me. I heard a lot of lip service from Delta about how much they valued my platinum medallion status , but it was all lip service and no action on their part. Delta was worthless in making any effort to connect me to my bag, and equipment that I needed for backcountry skiing. Additionally worthless was their compensation, or lack thereof, for making me go 9 days without the clothes and equipment that I needed. If you really need something for your trip I recommend contracting with a 3rd party delivery service company to get your stuff overseas, because you can't count on Delta at all. What a horrible experience. I have booked flights on Delta before when I could have paid less to fly their partners overseas. From now on, I'll be booking those flights with their partners instead and saving money since Delta showed my no loyalty nor benefit to book with Delta instead. I was flying exclusively with Delta. Now, I'm a free agent. Loyalty needs to work both ways, and did not for that trip. My trip ended up miserable due to Delta. too much time on the phones - accomplishing nothing, and very uncomfortable trying to do things with clothes and equipment that were not right nor meant for the experience, since everything else was stuck in never land in my bag."
"""Never flying Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Cleveland via Detroit. The flight from Seattle ran a bit late for the connecting flight however I made it in time to the gate. Delta basically just bumped me to a much later flight. Even though the doors ere still open and there were seats available my first class status didn't matter. I cant get a hold of a real person and there is no one available to make it right. Never flying Delta again."
"""I’m done with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Newark to Raleigh Durham. I’m done with Delta and going back to United. They are almost never on time though they claim a high on time statistic. I fly almost every week and know the claim is false. Shame on Delta who do nothing to make improvements."
"""a terrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Where do I start? We started our journey from Florida and had a delay due to a storm warning. Typical I hear for Florida which is out of the airlines control I understand. That's where the understanding ends. Our 1 hour layover got cut to 10 minutes to catch a connecting flight at a gate very far from our own. Upon finding out this information we spoke to the flight attendant and asked if they could give notification to the gate that we were still on our way and to inform them about the delay. The response was, hey don't worry about it, you can make it, no need for the call. So my pregnant wife and I were left running to our gate, making it 3 min past the departure time to watch our flight leaving the gate, and no attendant at the counter. At that point we just felt lost, and guess what, had to continue to wait till the attendant returned to the counter only to reply, ""Why didn't they just call? This could have been avoided?"" So at this point I am trying to keep my cool and am directed to the customer service counter. As I arrived at the Delta Customer service counter I am informed that there are no flights left for the night and no connecting flights. She gets us set up for the following day and a hotel accommodation. The customer service agent then gives us the packet and closes up for the night. We then wait for our tram, make it to the hotel just to find out that The reservations were reserved on a different name. And could not be checked in. We were informed by concierge that Delta would not accept the concierge changing the name and I would have to have customer service fax over the changes. I contact customer service who gave me a 40 min wait time before I could speak to a customer service rep, so not only has my pregnant wife had to run through an airport, call in sick for the following day and now have an at least 40 min wait till we can even check in for a flight 5 hours later. I request a call back and am returned a call an hour later just to get the response ""oh that Delta is different than this Delta, and you have to go back to the airport to get this changed. Ok, I figured maybe the rep just doesn't have the knowledge to fix the mistake, but no, after going through management I receive the same excuse even though they were able to pull up my flight information and transaction history. Oh I failed to mention during that 40 min wait time the concierge services were trying to contact Delta services via their vendor line and were getting continually hung up on by their rep line. So now I had to get a shuttle back, for the rep at the airline just for the rep to inform me that the place where my pregnant wife was staying at the moment wasn't even the hotel that my name had been reserved at. After going through the chain of events I had very little sympathy for any excuse that the airline had for trying to change us to a different hotel and was able to get the customer service rep to re-reserve the room in my name. I am writing this currently at the gate to my flight home so this travesty might continue, I figured that this would be enough to portray how much of a terrible experience this is. Oh just to add, my flight home now my wife and I are in non connecting seats and the gate customer service couldn't ""print tickets"" so I had to write down all the information on our receipts from the previous night, she didn't even have the courtesy to do that for me."
"""I am incredibly disappointed""","Not Verified | Honolulu to Seattle. My flight was delayed, causing me to miss my connection flight by three minutes. My connection flight must have pushed back early because 3 minutes after the time of the flight the plane had already taken off, and failed to wait at all. I was comped a voucher for up to 15$ for food while I had to wait over four hours in the airport for the next flight. This is unacceptable for this kind of treatment, and I will be highly discouraging others from traveling delta in the future. With over 16 hours of total travel time and incredibly poor service on the airline, I am incredibly disappointed."
"""make every effort to avoid them""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Rome. This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. I arrived at the airport 3 hours before my flight. When I went to check in my luggage, a service which cost me $120, I was told that the flight had been canceled and that they would have to reroute me to my destination. This process took them 2 hours. Given their delay and incompetence, I missed that flight and had to go back to the check-in counter. I was told that they couldn't get me on another flight until the next day. I was forced to find a hotel and pay for it on my own. My luggage had been sent on ahead and so I had no change of clothes and no toiletries. The next day I departed as scheduled. On my flight I was not served a meal which I had preordered and the television monitor did not work. It didn't matter because I was not provided with headphones and so I spent the entire 7-hour flight with nothing to do. I was not able to sleep because I was in an aisle seat and the flight attendants were going back and forth and kept bumping into me all night long. When I arrived at my final destination (36 hours late) my luggage had been lost and that took another 40 hours to deliver to me. I requested compensation from the airline several times and was denied. The bottom line is that they simply do not care about their customers. At the very least they should have covered the cost of the hotel and refunded my luggage fee but they chose instead to be greedy and uncaring. Their attitude and lack of service are terrible. I regret having flown with them and in the future I will make every effort to avoid them."
"""My experience was terrible""","Not Verified | My experience with Delta was terrible. From their staff advising my friend and I to each pay an additional 150 each to arrive one day early, only b/c one letter of my name was wrong on the ticket. Then after paying over 300 we were put on a the most packed airplane I have ever been on, with no water. We sat on the run way over an hour before taking flight and again at the airport, where we were suppose to catch our connecting Delta Flight. My friend and I literally ran through the airport, only to be turned away at the gate and left with a 3 hour lay over. So we spent an extra 300 dollars to not arrive any earlier than we originally planned for. The time we spent at the airport, we could have stayed in Vegas. I also wrote an email explaining in great detail the time of the plane departing and the time we arrived at the gate of our connecting flight- where were turned away. I got a generic email with a 25.00 credit that expired in 2 months! I am most frustrated because I feel like my email was not taken seriously. You can tell when a company actually cares, and that is not what i got from Delta."
"""She was very rude!""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Lagos via New York. So I'm sitting at the ATL airport now and decided to write this review before I forget after spending 2 weeks in Nigeria. I was told by the customer service rep over the phone to inform the check in staff that I'm pregnant. I went to the desk and notified the lady, she made a face like ""why are you telling me?"" I explained that I was told to tell her that so that I can board the plane with the ppl with kids and special needs. She said ""well if u feel like you need to board the plane early!"" She was very rude! Delta is hyped up to be the best airline but the customer service need to improve especially the staff in Atlanta."
"""thank you to amazing Delta staff""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Orlando. I would like to say thank you to the amazing Delta staff at at LaGuardia Airport in the departure section. The Delta staff was Nelly was amazing, we had arrived early for our flight to Florida and we were traveling as a family and it was my Nephews birthday and they made sure that he felt amazing like a birthday king."
"""disregard for customer service""","Not Verified | Seattle to Orlando. Terrible customer service! We bought our tickets 9 months ag. We paid extra money for comfort class and to sit together since we are flying with a toddler. We were notified via email this morning that they split our party up due to double-booking. I called and spoke with an agent who said that there was nothing that she could do or offer us and that I shouldn't expect to have a flight or have my seats just because I purchased tickets. Delta, if you overbook a flight, it is your problem and your fault. Not mine. We paid nearly $2000 to fly together in this row of seats. If someone who is flying solo double books one of our seats, then move that person (who is clearly okay with sitting alone). When I suggested this to the agent, she told me that Delta ""doesn't know which passengers are on our planes"" and ""does not have any way of contacting this person when we don't know who they are."" That's either the most negligent form of safety in the world or a complete lie. Either way, completely unacceptable. We've been loyal Skymiles members for years and we are ending our relationship with Delta. Complete disregard for customer service and safety."
"""really liked my flight""","Not Verified | I really liked my flight with Delta to Aruba. I sat in seat 11A on my flight. The service was on point and the flight attendants were friendly. The food was enjoyable. Even though the aircraft was aging, Delta kept this plane in really good condition. And also, even though my seat didn't have a window."
""" will be the last one""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Cleveland. It is not the first time that I fly with Delta but I promised to myself it will be the last one. People that work at the baggage claim so rude - specially from Cleveland when I went for check in the lady was so very rude. The plane so dirty and small, they don't offer you nothing. Expensive tickets."
"""missed check in by 5 minutes""","✅ Trip Verified | Syracuse to Atlanta. You would think that airline would work with you in cases of emergency but unfortunately that is untrue. Me and my husband were trying our hardest to catch a flight because his dad is dying and we wanted to make sure he got home to see him. We missed the check in time by 5 minutes and begged for someone to please let us on the flight. The lady at the desk called but didnt even mention our situation and just said rules are rules and I dont make them. Screw rules when there is someone's life on the line. Is an airline really not willing to help someone out who missed check in by 5 min. So he have to wait until tomorrow morning to fly out and we are praying that his dad can hold on until we arrive."
"""did not allow me to get on the earlier flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Norfolk. So Delta this is a news flash! Today I got to the airport early to try and get on an earlier flight than my scheduled one because it became important to get home sooner on my weekly commute schedule. Even though there were many seats available, because I had booked a basic economy ticket the agent did not allow me to get on the earlier flight. So I have to stay in ORF airport for a lot of hours and Delta gets to give up the possibility of selling my seat on the later flight because they are unwilling to let a ticketed passenger on an earlier flight that had 20 ish seats empty. Flight after sold out. Totally stupid to do that to me just because I didn’t spend an extra $40 on the initial ticket. You lost potential for an extra $500!"
"""exhausting difficult flight experience""","Not Verified | What a nightmare! Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again. Most businesses would be out of business if they conducted business in this manor."
"""attendants looked annoyed""","✅ Trip Verified | I don’t complain often, but this is my second ever flying with Delta. I have met some really nice workers that work there who were very helpful. My only issue is, a couple of the flight attendants there and back were rude and seemed as though they didn’t want to be asked for assistance. Also, I look very young. So, I get I have to show my ID often. I highly suggest, the company speaks with their flight attendants about ID’ing a guest before blatantly lying about not serving a drink that’s on the menu and also never coming back. I also asked for soft drinks or snacks and one of the flight attendants looked annoyed that I even asked her. It’s frustrating to get that type of service. As for the rest of the workers, they were great and very welcoming."
"""extremely unprofessional and rude""","✅ Trip Verified | I booked a flight with Delta to leave on 4/19/19 at 9 am, from Chicago to Phoenix. It was a connecting flight with a 30 minute layover in Detroit. Before getting on the plane, I informed the flight attendant of my short layover. I also found out 9 other passengers were going to Phoenix too. I asked politely if she could make an announcement at the end of the flight, so all 10 of us can get up before everyone else stands up.Her response “You better run”! During the duration of the flight, I asked multiple times if they can make the announcement, which they didn’t! Once we landed, we were waiting for about 10 minutes until we got off the plane because of Deltas incompetent flight attendants! Our flight arrived at gate 22 and our flight to Phoenix was departing from gate 74! I and 9 other passengers ran 50 gates down. Once we got to the gate, our plane was still there. I might mention they were still finishing up putting the luggage in. Flight attendant at the desk was there to inform us that they won’t open the door for us, even though they knew we were coming. All of us just stood there out of breath and watched our plane leave. Without being apologetic, she told us the next flight departs at 4:20pm. She was very informed though and mentioned to us that they were having problems due to weather conditions in the east coast. And Delta I must applaud you for how accurate your flight attendants are! Just like she warned us, our flight got delayed to 5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and then 8:30! All 10 of us ended up leaving Detroit at 8:50 and getting to Phoenix at 10:30! If it wasn’t for the flight attendants on the plane, all 10 of us would make it on time and be in Phoenix at 1pm! That 10 minutes (if the flight attendant would just make an announcement) when we were waiting for everyone to get off the plane, would’ve saved us from being stranded at the airport for 8 hours! I guess an announcement is way too much to ask Delta! Our plane left with 10 seats empty when they knew all other flights were getting cancelled. Some passengers from our flight got vouchers and some didn’t! I went to talk to someone at the Deltas help desk and got a privilege of once again speaking to another Deltas courteous flight attendant. She informed me and I’m quoting “you don’t deserve a voucher because it was your fault you didn’t make the flight,” You should’ve ran faster”. Ive asked to speak to the manager and she replied “good luck”. She also refused to give me any badge number, last name and refused to call the manager! After asking random flight attendants at the airport, I finally spoke to a supervisor and someone else that was above him. Both of them told me that I should call Delta. The only problem is that days after I still never got a call back! Delta, how are you allowed to sell connecting flights with 30 min layover when they’re 50 gates apart! Yes, I’ve heard from again very professional Delta flight attendants that I was the one who booked the flight. The problem is, you don’t inform anyone that you have to run 50 gates down while we re booking it. And you definitely don’t inform your costumers of flight attendants that instead of helping passengers, they’re extremely unprofessional and rude! To sum up this trip, Delta thank you for ruining my Easter! Advice: keep your phone handy, because all other passengers I’ve met in my 8hours of being in Detroit, everyone seemed to agree on one thing."
"""price is good value""","✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo to Singapore. The ground staffs are efficient and polite. The Cabin crews are great but lack of smile. One Japanese cabin crew was the best. She is very polite, efficient and helpful with great smile. The main food from Tokyo is much better than food from Singapore bound. The plane is old B767 but clean with not bad entertainment. The seat is slightly on smaller side for economy size. The price is good value. Will fly again if the price is good."
"""annoyance in her face""","✅ Trip Verified | Richmond to Atlanta. My husband walked up to flight attendant, and asked her if she would let us know when we would be able to change seats because we were assigned different seats. He didn’t noticed it until time of boarding. Which we totally understood this was our mistake. The problem that really got to the both of us was her tone, she basically told him; the best thing he could do is ask someone to switch seats if he wanted to move. Her words wasn’t the problem, it was the tone of her voice and look of annoyance in her face. She later walked up and down the isle without even looking at him. I decided to go ahead and move to seats that were empty, my husband followed. As she was passing beverages she then looked at us; without even acknowledging our move by saying anything that showed slightest concern that we were able to sit together, but said, you do realize you’re sitting in seats that require being able to assistance in case of emergency? Again; nasty tone, no smile or anything to feel like we weren’t annoying her. She then asked if we wanted any beverages but then told the attendant behind her to give it to us! I can’t begin to explain completely how that woman made us feel, and hope she’s made aware that every customer on that flight deserves to be treated with respect and common courtesy!"
"""no effort on anyone's part""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Santiago via Atlanta. Worst flight experience of my life. I always thought Delta was a good airline, I've been learning lately that's not the case. I understand there can be delays due to weather but there was absolutely no effort on anyone's part to get us (there was a small group needing to connect) on an earlier flight, off the plane quickly or communicate with the gate that we were running late. After the fact all I got was attitude as I was passed off from person to person. I canceled my Delta card, will do everything in my power to never fly with them again."
"""has improved a lot""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Detroit return in economy. Delta Air Lines has improved a lot their products both on ground and on air, crews very motivated, charming and professional. It's becoming more European and increasing the level of quality. They'll be my first choice in US. I think it's the best product in US compared to AA & UA."
"""no food, water, or any compensation""","Not Verified | My Delta Air Lines ""Compfort plus"" transfer flight from Atlanta to San Juan was scheduled at for 6pm, and ""delayed"" to 8:30 am the next day. After waiting 2 hours at the airport, and an additional hour for a Delta desk attendant I was given a hotel voucher with no directions to get there, no food, water, or any voucher or compensation. I shouldn't have to ask forcompensation for an overnight delay."
"""customer service was top notch""","✅ Trip Verified | Norfolk to Lexington via Atlanta. After going through the nightmare of flying with American earlier in the week, what a pleasant return it was to return to Delta Airlines. Both flights arrived early and customer service was top notch. The best you could expect from a short domestic flight. Glad I canceled my return American flight because it was cancelled completely today. Delta got me home safely and early."
"""I was refused boarding""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Austin. I had to wait in a long line, my stuff got stuck for no reason in security due to a camera issue, had to run it back there then there were no clear directions to get to terminal 30 and when I found it I was refused access and then when I made it to my terminal 10 min prior to flight time I was refused boarding. The guy who told me no had no empathy."
"""absolutely disappointing ""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Cancun via Atlanta. We landed from Baltimore after a delay due to “severe weather” but for some reason that “severe weather” didn’t keep my flight to Cancun from leaving Atlanta without approximately 30 passengers that were coming from Baltimore. And one particular customer service rep at the counter decided that it was a good idea to offer a voucher/discount for a hotel to one couple but not other families! Why the discrimination? She also provided the worst flights for us to choose from to make it an even horrible experience. But yet other customers had better flight options. I have never had this experience when flying. The worst customer service! It’s absolutely disappointing and at the same time surprising that I’ve had better contacts with Spirit. Southwest waits for its customers. And no discrimination between first class and those who can’t afford it. Oh and the reps who refused to provide exceptional customer service at the Delta counter in Atlanta and made the experience even worse. So for those who choose to fly using Delta, that’s what you expect to deal with. If you have a layover, not even because of the weather, will they wait for you. They will put you on the worst available flight even though there are better flights with only first class seats available. Delta will not give up their first class seats to you because you paid for economy though “weather” screwed up your layover. They prefer to put you on the most inconvenient flight than to give up their available seats on the next better flight because the only seats left on that flight are first class. We waited to speak to a manager or supervisor but no one showed their face. No one felt it important to come speak to us."
"""don’t waste your time""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Punta Cana with Delta. Worst airline ever. If you have a day to get delayed just for an uncomfortable seat then fly Delta. Have not flown Delta in 5 years for a reason, decided to try them out again and same old stuff, don’t waste your time."
"""took over 5 hours""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to New York. The flight was supposed to depart at 940pm. The weather was clear. We were first told there were too many planes in the air for us to get on our plane. 3 hours later, we get on a plane. The wrong plane that is. We then wait on the wrongly boarded plane for 2 more hours as the ground crew leisurely empties the excess fuel from the wrongly boarded plane, because of a weight issue for landing at our destination. They also needed to get our luggage off whatever plane we were supposed to be on in the first place and had to load it on to this wrongly boarded plane that we were currently on. It really seemed as if nobody had any idea what was going on the entire time. My flight was only supposed to be an hour and a half, but took over 5 hours, because of incompetent workers. Flying Delta out of atlanta shouldn’t be this hard when their company is based out of here."
"""My luggage was lost in travel""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Minneapolis. My luggage was lost in travel a lot of promises day by day for when I would get it. Three days later still sitting in same airport. Now that I went my whole trip with out anything I need I just asked them to send it back to where I came from. Then i got told i could not send it there because i was there yet. I leave back in 12 hours hope I see my stuff again."
"""Went above and beyond her job""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Atlanta. The past few times I have flown Delta I haven’t received the best customer care service. However, my last flight from Salt Lake City there was a blonde flight attendant, Alison, and she was amazing. Helped everyone around us. Went above and beyond her job. Made me feel welcomed and just made the flight so much better. Made me very happy."
"""seats were very comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | Cincinnati to Denver. Originally, my family members (2 adults with one baby on our lap and 1 child in a seat) were split up. Delta staff members were able to accommodate us so that we could all sit in the same row. The monitors on the back of the seats have all sorts of free movies and tv shows. This was a life saver for traveling with two kids. The seats were very comfortable. The process of boarding and exiting the plane went very smoothly."
"""clearly treat passengers as fodder""","✅ Trip Verified | Edinburgh to New York JFK. In flight fairly standard service, cabin crew not overly observant or attentive, no facility to pre book seats prior to check in at the airport which by today’s standards is archaic and needles to say (as is so often mentioned within numerous reviews elsewhere) no seats available allowing my wife and I to sit together, the original seating arrangement put us 20 rows apart but after 10 minutes of pleading at check in we were permitted to sit a row apart both in the centre seats, it appears some booking sites appear to have preferential terms with Delta and this unfortunate enough not to book thru Delta preferred sites super to get the fodder seats with no concern for family wishing to travel the 7 hour flight together, one gets the sense that this is a regular occurrence with this airline as they do throw you some hope when they see how disappointed you are at the outset of your holiday to find you are sitting 20 rows apart fir the day, knowing we were to be returning 10 days later we asked how we could at least secure return flight seats together but were told we would have to call Delta next week from the states and the member of Delta staff gave us a reference number for the flight which transpired to be a completely bogus reference, after calling 3 times from New York we eventually waited 36 minutes to get connected to an operator who could assist us, eventually after much referencing etc we were first offered the emergency exit row fir $74 but that kind offer was hastily withdrawn when the operator discovered my wife was 53 and so ”too old” to fly in these seats and so it would appear the only option Delta can offer us is our 20 rows apart middle seated again for our return flights. They clearly treat passengers as fodder and have nobody it would seem in their system that can assist passengers who have already paid, they are a joke airline and I would strongly suggest you consider your options very carefully before coming anywhere near these people, just try lodging a query or complaint through their online system, like all there systems deliberately designed to make you give up the will to live before you can complete the laborious pointless questions hurdles, their website is so old design that it crashes if you spend any more than 3 minutes on it forcing you to have to return to the start again, joke service, joke airline, a throwback to 1970’s flying and best consigned to the bin, get your transatlantic tickets elsewhere even if you pay a bit more, at least you will be able to spend the flight with your family rather than the two 400lb snoring strangers I had to endure!! Best of luck to you!"
"""Never flying Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible, never want to fly Delta again. I had my Grandmothers funeral the day after we were supposed to get there. Our flight from Minneapolis to Alanta was delayed by 2 hours due to technical difficulties. I get that, sure. But the only people that were Helpful was Jeanne, the representative in Alanta who tried to help. She went as far as trying to help us get a rental, this woman needs a raise! Only reason didnt take it was cause it was so late at night and was afraid of wrecking. Delta got us a flight the next morning but I showed up late for my grandmothers funeral! Tried to contact Delta for a refund but all they wanted to give was a gift card. Never flying Delta again I'm sticking to Southwest"
"""Shame on Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Costa Rica to Cedar Rapids via Atlanta. Flight delayed due to tech problems. We were told by Delta that hotel would be provided in ATL since we would miss our flight home. Once in ATL, we were issued vouchers but once we got to the shuttle we were informed that all hotels were booked in the area! We had to find a hotel on our own. My husband is handicapped. No assistance was provided at all. Delta knew hours in advance that many people on our flight would miss their flights, NOTHING was done about it. Shame on Delta."
"""No accountability at all by anyone""","Not Verified | Very disappointed in Delta. Original flight time was 10:23pm, received 3 notifications (2 text, 1 email) that the flight time was changed to 11pm. Arrived at the gate at 10:25 to find boarding closed and another couple also at the gate. They spoke with the gate agent who said the time was moved back up - no notification of this. No one was paged. She was to check with her supervisor as the plane was still at the gate and get back to them. She never returned and the plane left us at the gate. Next flight out was 8:15 am the next day. No hotel vouchers because we should have been at the gate for the original boarding time! No accountability at all by anyone at Delta, no accommodation for the trouble. Very poor policy and customer service! I was told the plane started boarding at 10:15, not sure how it was complete and closed within 10 minutes?"
"""a solid and reliable product""","Not Verified | Took 7 legs on Delta Air Lines within one week. Pretty much all flights on time. FA's were all friendly to very friendly. Boeing 757/A321/737 I flew on had all personal screens with a vast choice of movies and TV series for free. Power plugs on almost all seats (2 in a row of 3 seats) for quick charge. You can still stream movies and stuff via your cellphone/tablet through the on board wifi. Using messager like Whatsapp is free of charge. The beverage service is also good. On longer flights they usually offer you 2 rounds of nonalcoholic beverages for free. On the 3,5 hour SJO-ATL leg they came through with water twice on top of that. However, food is still a joke. On a 5 hour flight LAX-SJO all you get is a dry small sandwich. While planes, even the older ones look nice and clean I found dirty seat trays a couple of times which is not nice. Bring antibacterial wipes. So you have to eat at the airport before your flight. Overall Delta offers a solid and reliable product."
"""was told boarding was closed""","✅ Trip Verified | My flight left Detroit late, but onboard we were told time may be made up in air. Several times I asked a staff member about making my connecting flight. I was told she would check. This didn’t happen. When we landed I had 40 min before departure. I asked a staff member about which gate to go to. He told me I could check the screen. He also said if I ran (I’m 71) I could make it. He said the airport was easy to navigate. It was not. He said there were others going on that same flight and the Air France to Cape Town staff knew we were coming. He said they’d hold the flight, not to worry. After I deplaned I couldn’t find the screen so I ran, through security, through shops, onto a tram, asking at other gates where my gate was and was told by 1 person they were too busy. I got someone to tell me the gate number and after running as fast as I could I got to the gate, the plane was there but I was told boarding was closed. 14 hours later I was on my way to Johannesburg, not Cape Town. I connected in Johannesburg for Cape Town after a hassle and going to the Air France office to get problem straightened."
"""the worst travel experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Washington DC. This was the worst travel experience I’ve had in all my years of travel. I will never fly Delta again. The hassle in getting seat assignments at the gate, flight cancellation, poor accommodations due to cancelled flight, rude gate associate, then a delayed flight back are just a few complaints. The pilots and flight attendants were very nice but didn’t compensate for the other negative experiences."
"""expressing my gratitude""","Not Verified | I am expressing my gratitude to Delta airlines and their employees that helped us from Sacramento to Seattle to Milwaukee. I was traveling with my elderly parents, one of whom struggles physically. We had window seats on our second leg of the flight and we requested aisle seats. When we arrived in Seattle, we approached the ticket counter about getting a wheel chair for my mother on to the plane and they asked our name and had new boarding passes waiting for us and we had wonderful seats in the first 5 rows of seating. We are so grateful for the help from all of your employees. We were weary travelers and they were so kind, helpful and efficient. The plane seemed brand new. The flight attendants were cheerful and so helpful. This was a delightful end to a week of travel. This experience leaves a lasting memory and I look forward to flying Delta in the the future!"
"""had great service""","✅ Trip Verified | Toronto to Miami via Atlanta. I am pleased with the value for money I get with Delta airlines in first. Check-in at YYZ was quick and friendly and our luggage was tagged priority. YYZ does not have a lounge in the US departures although it could be purchased. We boarded first and were offered a pre-flight drink. Both legs there and back were short so only snack and beverages were offered. Seats were comfortable and FAs were friendly and efficient. ATL is a great airport to transit through and is easy to transfer between flights/terminals and has good lounges. At both MIA and YYZ our luggage was on the belt promptly. Delta first class for this journey was about half of the cost compared to Canadian airlines flying the same route (although they flew direct). When traveling as a family of three, the extra 90 minutes going through ATL was worth the savings. All flight arrived on time and had great service."
"""ridiculously cramped seating""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Kona. Despite ridiculously cramped seating for a five hour plus flight Delta delivers a decent product. 12 cramped seats that resemble coach of not too long ago do little justice to the term first or even business class. The crew, however, went a long way in making up for an insulting hard product. The entertainment, other then the pathetic head phones, is excellent with many choices. The food was decent but hardly premium in any way. Also,they offer Wi-Fi which is rare to and from the islands.The executives who ok all this ought to be ashamed and also very grateful to their wonderful crews."
"""were engaging and professional""","✅ Trip Verified | Overall, pretty happy with DL, especially on DTW-LAX sector. The cabin crew were engaging and professional. In terms of service, Comfort+ gets an enhanced snack selection. I wish the choices were more substantial for a 4+ hour flight, but what they offered was good and we could take what we wanted. Did two rounds of full beverage service and a round of water service. LAX - DTW (redeye) - I liked that the cabin crew were so quiet during the flight. I never heard loud voices, and the announcements were limited to initial departure and final descent. Finally - new boarding process. It seems more organized, especially with the pillars. However, two things kind of irked me: 1) Delta created all of these new boarding groups, yet still had and additional three ""special"" (those needing a little extra time, active military and those with children under two). I think one ""special"" boarding will do, and 2) There were no pillars for Main 3 and Basic Economy (last two boarding groups). This, along with the gate agent's announcements, seemed condescending to the passengers in these groups. I know these groups represent passengers in the lower fare categories, but they still paid for the service and really should not be singled out."
"""too late to check in""","✅ Trip Verified | We had planned a quick 4-day getaway thru Expedia with our two kids to Puerto Vallarta for spring break. The flight to Mexico was with Aeromexico (in partnership with Delta). We arrived at the MSP airport the morning of departure and the parking garage was full so we were directed to park at a different airport, which we did, but had to take two light rails and drag two kids and our luggage up and down countless escalators and long corridors before we reached the Delta desk to check in (nearly an hour later). We had checked in online the night before and just had one suitcase to check but due to the parking debacle we were told it was now too late to check in and we were sent to the Delta special services desk. We waited in line there and were eventually told that she couldn’t help us either, that it was too late to check in and since we had booked thru Expedia we were told we had to call them. We found chairs at the entrance to the airport and started calling to see if we could get bumped to the next flight. After time spent on hold, Expedia told us we had to call Aeromexico, which we did but were told that their computers were down and so they would have to call us back. We were continuing to make calls to see if anyone at Delta, Expedia or Aeromexico could help when someone I knew entered the airport thru the entrance we were seated at. We came up with a ‘Hail Mary’ idea of consolidating our luggage into our carry-ons and sent our one big (now empty) suitcase home with her husband, who had just dropped her off at the airport. This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldn’t help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we “no-showed” they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there weren’t any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldn’t give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but I’m also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta. Though they partner with Aeromexico and have a help desk in the airport, they did absolutely nothing to help us!"
"""an above average airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft. Lauderdale to Salt Lake City. Above average US airline. Boarding was disorganized, all that the gate agents cared about was getting first class on before everyone else. However, once we got onboard, the flight attendants provided great care and were very cheerful. The inflight entertainment was amazing, as there were over 100 movies on a domestic flight, although Delta does charge for headphones (you can bring your own free of charge). The food was your average American pretzels & peanuts, but they also provided cookies, which are by far one of the best free snacks offered on a US carrier. The bathrooms were pretty clean and our bag was on the carousel within 5 minutes. Delta is an above average airline and is not as overpriced as American. Tickets cost us around 250 per passenger round trip."
"""it was unbelievably cold""","✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Cancun via Atlanta. Flying in a freezer. Our experience with Delta was pretty mixed. Our flights from Frankfurt to Atlanta were not too bad. Food was okay. Ground service was great as Delta has a good boarding process which we really liked. The economy seats were a little bit uncomfortable if you compare them to other airlines. The IFE system has lots of films series and what not, Sadly you cannot adjust the angle of the screen which is not good as it is hard to see anything when the person in front of you pushs the seat back. The second segment from ATL to CUN was also okay and only a short 2hrs flight, same counts for the way back CUN to ATL. Then it all started...for the last segment we thought, lets go comfort and have better experience. We had seats in row 21 (E+F) next to emergency exit. It was horrible cold even with three blankets covering my legs, result of that was/is having a nice cold when arrived home. The blankets are joke btw. Also the ear plugs do not do what they should do. I have not tested the headphones as they have no ANC in economy so i used my own. The food on Comfort plus was exactly the same like standard economy so not worth spending additional money on Comfort.. I still give 5 out of 10 as the rest was okay. Delta wont be my first choice but it was okay, except the fact it was unbelievably cold on the plane especially on that specific seat."
"""Extremely poor service""","✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Atlanta. First when boarding 3 times we had to stop Delta representatives from tagging our bags with the wrong tags. When we boarded the flight it was blowing hot air into the cabin. Once the flight began the wifi took an hour to come up and while trying to watch a movie I finally gave up. First the movie shut off and wouldn't restart. The second movie kept freezing and 2 attempts later I gave in. Once we were on the ground the baggage handling crew didn't get not only our bag but also 4 other family's bags off the plane in time to be able to clear customs and make our connecting flight. When we informed the gate representative of the situation they sent us to a help desk that was closed. After raising a little sand we were finally given a supervisor that basically said that they couldn't help us. That security goes home at 8pm and you are just or of luck. Extremely poor service, extremely poorly handled by delta reps on the ground. Not acceptable for a company that proved itself to be worthless and overall not helpful at their national headquarters and main hub of Atlanta."
"""boarding staff extremely rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Knoxville to Atlanta, DL3302. Plane is good enough. However the boarding staff are extremely rude. They don’t know how to speak with the passengers. They need strict training on how to speak and deal with the passengers. I will never fly this airline again."
"""Very disappointed""","Not Verified | Very disappointed with our Delta flight at Detroit. We were held up in customs because there were not enough officers to get people through in a timely manner. Then, we arrived at our gate and Constance (a supervisor) would not let us board the plane even though we had gone through security, through customs—and our plane was still sitting at the end of the jetway! We were frantic—but she would not let us board! Instead, we waited 6hrs for another flight. Does not make sense why this happened."
"""Annoying airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Toronto via Atlanta. The guys distributing the food ignored me once, ignored me twice, upon asking they ignored me again. When an air-hostess came to pick up garbage I had to ask her for food again and finally the food was served. Also, before the flight departed they asked all the passengers to get their carry-on trolley-bags to be checked-in, I had to do the same with only one trolley bag. Later, I found that the seat carry-on cabins had plenty of space everywhere! Annoying airline in simple words!"
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Had to run from one end of the airport to the opposite end as I took a Delta flight from Austin TX to Salt Lake and then a jump flight to Portland. I had 10 minutes to make the jump flight due to a slight delay of when we landed. When finally making it to the plane I asked two flight attendants on the plane how long the flight is, one of the guys answered with “hello” in a condensing tone. I responded with the same question, how long is the flight (I was not rude but tired and out of breath), his response with an absolutely rude and condescending smile was “hello”. Then both the lady attendant and male attendant laughed at me and said, boy he’s rude and then laughed again. I was shocked and never did receive an answer to my simple question. My flight from Austin to Salt Lake was a horrible flight. I’m 6’1” and my knees were literally smashed against the seat in front of me; one offering of a beverage for a flight that is just over two hours. I will never fly Delta again. Oh, and one of the photos below shows mold on the wind shade. Nasty!"
"""Not happy with customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Redmond/Bend to Seattle. Not happy with Delta's customer service. My flight was delayed twice and then delayed due to weather. I asked for a voucher for the same flights on a different weekend and was only given a credit with their airline for the same amount. The reason I booked this flight was because I couldn't afford anything more, however now all the flights are more expensive. now I have tried to rebook for a different weekend and the ticket is 40 dollars more. After trying to figure out how to enter my credit number in online I was lost and frustrated. Called the company and can only do it over the phone, and now was forced to pay an additional 20$ to the 40$ increase already, to a ""main cabin fee"" vs basic economy(which I originally purchased) because it is their policy. After much complaining and speaking with supervisors I was finally given the basic economy price-still 40$ more than my originally purchased ticket. I am grateful for the basic economy price, but frustrated with the entire situation when I feel as a consumer I should have been given a service for the original price I paid in the beginning."
"""Really bad experience""","Not Verified | San Diego to Las Vegas. Really bad experience, our flight was delayed for 2 hours. Then when we were actually landed, we were sitting on the air strip for 40 minutes after the attendants were telling us to remain seated and it would be only a ""few"" minutes until we were ready to leave the plane. After a frustrating 2 hour delay, many passengers who had to use the restroom but were told to remain in their seats it was really annoying and frustrating. We read good reviews about this airline but unfortunately we were the unlucky few. Even after all of the inconvenience we were not even offered any type of reimbursements, or perks for the inconvenience. They didn't even offer refreshments like juice or soda."
"""Delta is horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to South Bend via Detroit. Delta is horrible. Their on time in and out of SBN is abysmal. This weekend they had a 3.5 hr delay in DTW due to equipment that was known at least 4.5 hrs ahead of scheduled departure and refused to put stranded DTW passengers on an open and on time United flight to SBN. Delta offered nothing including no food, no drink and charged amex platinum holders $29 skyclub. So inconsiderate with a 3.5 hr delay it should have beem comp'd. No concern for passengers. Fly United or American from now on."
"""worst airline experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Louisville to Atlanta. Absolutely worst airline experience of my life. First and last time I use Delta. Every flight was overbooked and they kept requesting volunteers to take other flights, 2 of our 4 flights were delayed, one flight delay caused us to miss another flight and we were stuck at the airport for hours. Every plane had to do an involuntary bag check because there was no room left on the plane. People were extremely rude. I can’t believe this airline has stayed in business. Never again."
"""displeased with Delta’s response""","✅ Trip Verified | Cleveland to Savannah via Atlanta. I am very displeased with Delta’s response to my complaint. I was on a flight with a service animal in front of me. I am highly allergic to animals and had an asthma attack. Delta said they cannot deny a service animal due to medical conditions. The man seemed very healthy. My medical condition is chronic due to this incident. My ten day vacation has been ruined."
"""luggage was left in Atlanta""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight 2550 from Atlanta to Toronto was a nightmare. Had booked my flights Nov 2018 and yet was the last person to get a seat on the return from Atlanta to Toronto. Not only that but the gate personnel asked me to leave my carry-on bag at the gate as the plane was full and had been overbooked. I got the seat the last minute and when I arrived in Toronto, I found out my carry-on luggage was left in Atlanta with my winter jacket, phone charger and personal belongings in it. Will avoid Delta in the future."
"""Delta will be my first choice""","Not Verified | Pleasantly surprised. Flights left on time and arrived on time or early. Only one delay, which was expected, due to snowstorm in Boston. Delta communication regarding this delay was timely and accurate. I realized the evening I arrived home that I had left my Kindle in the seat pocket. The following day I opened a Lost Item Report with the airline. I did not have much hope that my Kindle would be found and returned. I received daily emails from Delta, and after 8 days the email stated that an item matching the one described by me was found. I followed the instructions for the item to be mailed to me. To my delight, I did receive my Kindle back and much quicker than stated in the emails! It is reassuring that an airline would take the time and effort to locate my Kindle and return it to me. This trip was my third in one month's time, the other 2 trips taken with a different major airline. Every one of those other trips resulted in at least a 2 1/2 hour delay for various reasons, some understandable and most not. Lack of communication from the other major airline, only one time was compensation offered, and each delay resulted in doubling the time it should have taken to travel to the destinations. Delta will be my first choice when planning my next travel adventure."
"""Very disorganized airline""","Not Verified | San Diego to Las Vegas. The flight was 2 hours delayed! And then when we finally got to the destination, we had to sit on the plane for 30-40 minutes waiting for them to finally find a gate. A 1.5 hour flight became a 6 hour ordeal. Would’ve been better off driving and would’ve gotten there faster. Very disorganized airline! Will think twice before flying Delta ever again."
"""Avoid it at all costs""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Knoxville. Worst airline in the world. Avoid it at all costs. My flight was supposed to be at 9 pm they delayed it to 9.30pm, then to 10.05pm, further to 12.30 am. Finally they cancelled the flight. Booked me in for the morning flight at 9.00 am. And its already delayed by 2 hrs. I hope I get to my destination with Delta Airlines."
"""complete utter disrespect""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Akron . Complete waste and complete utter disrespect by the customer service department! My flight was “rescheduled” for an earlier time when I was an hour early. The lady at the counter was very rude and told me I had to buy an additional ticket to get home on top of a round trip ticket I originally purchased. And of course another hotel room and missing a day of work. Unorganized. Never flying with delta again!"
"""never fly with Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Calgary via Seattle. This is a terrible airline. For the round trip, every flight was extremely late in it's boarding. Then, all of a sudden, our last flight got delayed by 3 hours. When we asked why, the Delta rep told us it was because of maintenance that the plane underwent earlier that morning, which apparently pushed everything behind schedule. What makes no sense is the fact that if the maintenance was undertaken in the morning and the schedule pushed back so much, why did it take until 10 minutes before out flight to make us aware of the huge delay? And why was the situation not rectified in any way? We did not receive any kind of compensation at all, and the only recognition of their fault was in one line in an email reading 'Apologies for the inconvenience.' This apology did not help me get to work the following day like I had planned. And I don't need a stupid travel voucher from this terrible company. I will never fly with Delta Airlines again and I hope those that do have much better experiences than I did."
"""every flight delayed / late""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Calgary. On my trip with Delta, every single flight was delayed / late. Workers could care less. Using Canadian airlines such as WestJet really showed the discrepancy between the quality of the airlines. I will never fly Delta again. Poor customer service. Poor aircraft. Lack of support or accommodation for their short comings. It’s a common narrative from many people that Delta screws their customers over. Believe the hype."
"""not use this company again""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Salt Lake City. Treat economy like trash. Don’t leave storage space for economy. Force economy passengers to check their bags in so that they can wait an hour to find their bag. They could care less about economy and allow more passengers then they have space for. Don’t even call the passengers economy but “the rest of the people on this flight”. Show favoritism for families not matter what age. I will not use this company again."
"""Stop overselling flights""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew from New Orleans to Phoenix through Atlanta today. I received a seat on the first leg of the flight and was placed on the stand-by list for the second leg. I am flabbergasted that I was not made aware of the stipulations of Delta’s “Basic Economy” fare prior to purchase and I received NO notification upon check-in of the fact that there was a chance I would not be flying all the way home tonight. After google informed me of my impending doom (this information was very hard to find on Delta’s website), I downloaded the Delta app in a panic. Thankfully, of the 21 people on the stand-by list, I was second in line. Surprisingly, there appeared to be 60 open seats. Because I purchased the basic fare, I had no option to upgrade. Why not just assign these open seats to individuals at purchase? Why not be transparent about the robbery of charging $600 for a “normal” fare while tricking those of us who can’t afford that into a “basic” fare that includes the chance of being stranded? Why guarantee me a flight for half of my trip and then leave me hanging in some strange city? This is a despicable way to do business. I will not be flying with Delta again. Stop overselling flights or be honest with your customers."
"""a negative experience""","✅ Trip Verified | . It seems every time I fly Delta I have a negative experience. From rude women that check you in to a freezing cold flight to delays to cancellations it seems I’ve been through it all. I make it a point to fly delta because I thought they were a pretty established airline (the prices reflect so). The customer service outside of the aircraft may be the worst!! I am about to throw in the towel on this airline. On this experience they delayed my flight from Erie 4 times which made us late to our connecting flight, I get to the gate completely out of breath to see that they locked the door on time (so they say) with 4 people not on the plane (that I saw). The only good experience I had in the half way flight just now was how calm the gentleman was with me (I was very irate) rebooking my ticket for the next day. Shame on delta."
"""Worst airline ever flown""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. Worst airline I have ever flown. The staff in LA are rude and not at all about customer service. The lady that was at the gate should not be working that job. The last row seat from Hawaii to LA was the worst flight in all my decades of flying. The seat doesn't recline and the seat in front of you is un your lap with no room at all to move. No leg room in the last row, other rows we were in on this trip were fine. I will never fly Delta again. They should teach the crew how to be customer friendly. The flight is to take off in 40 minutes and the staff is just chatting instead of helping the line of us that have been standing here over an hour from our connecting flight. Terrible people. Delta is horrible."
"""Good service""","✅ Trip Verified | Nashville to San Juan via Atlanta. All flights arrived early or on time. Seats were somewhat cramped because I am 6’1. Delta Comfort is worth the extra charge if you are tall. Great selection on entertainment. Good service. Definitely my choice between US airlines. Will fly again. Planes looked to be in perfect condition."
"""not happy with her answer""","✅ Trip Verified | We got in aircraft in Minneapolis and there was no room for my carry on bag. We were flying to Sydney via Los Angeles. I said I need my carry on bag for next flight, but flight attendant rudely told me if I don’t want to check my bag in then maybe I should catch next airplane. I am not happy with her answer. Next time I’d look for different airlines. I payed few thousand dollars for tickets and don’t want to be treated like that!"
"""Absolutely terrible customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Two fights leaving Minneapolis to Fargo. I was on the later flight so tried to change to the earlier flight. Would of been charged $75 a ticket to change (me and my wife, two tickets $150) I literally did not have enough money to pay this and asked the ticket agent to help as I’ve switched flights before without being charged (on Delta). She said that it comes down to the day and how busy the flight is, and in her own words “comes down to the ticket agent and if they want to waive that fee or not”. I waited until everyone else was on board and pleaded with the ticket agent to help me out but they drug there feet and “thought about it” and chatted with each other about non work related subjects until it was to late and they closed the doors with me standing there. Bags in hand and 7 open seats on the flight. Absolutely terrible customer service. Not even a word out of her mouth or an apology for it. Just shut the gate and ignored me and went back to chatting with a different coworker."
"""service is pretty bad""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Atlanta. Customer care service sucks and they are very unappreciative. They make it very hard for customers and their service is pretty bad. Hate the service."
"""this was a good flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Like the outgoing flight from JFK, boarding for this flight was quite orderly, proving that Delta's new boarding process worked. The seat on this 767 was more comfortable than the one on the A330, though legroom was a bit tight. However, the aircraft looked tired, and the IFE was a bit outdated. Meal service was good, providing this was a domestic flight. The flight departed and arrived on time, but it took longer than normal for our luggage to arrive at the carousel at JFK. Overall, this was a good flight."
"""professional and also sincere""","✅ Trip Verified | Toronto to Aruba via Atlanta. I would just like to thank the travel consultant Michael that helped my sisters and I when we had to make a flight down to Aruba in a hurry, due to my parents health. He helped us with the boarding and the booking of the return flight. It is very rare these days to have someone help as much as this employee did. He was very professional and also sincere with his actions."
"""Awful customer service""","Not Verified | Awful customer service. Flight crew are typically very nice and professional. Flights are more often on time than late, but when they are late they do not announce it until the last moment or even give wrong information to make it appear that the flight is not as delayed as it is and then they keep pushing official departure time by a couple of minutes at times until they reach the real departure time which makes it very hard to plan anything (connections, business, rides) in a reliable fashion. They will say that the flight won’t take off at 5 but 5.15, at 5.10 they say it will take off at 5.45, at 5.30 they say it will take off at 6, until they finally admit that that departure is delayed by 1.5 hours and it will happen at 6.30. In the meantime you have to change your subsequent plans 5 times due to incorrect information. Food served is extremely unhealthy. Beverages okay with wide variety of options."
"""staff were unwelcoming""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Las Vegas with Delta Air Lines. The staff were unwelcoming and had a bad attitude when I tried to see if I could change my seat location. I don’t understand how you could have such horrible customer service! Your passengers are paying hundreds of dollars to fly and they can’t even be nice to you! I use to love this airline because the other companies were very bad! But now they are bad too! The Orlando gate agent was so rude, telling us to sit down, then when no one left the line she rudely was said “or not I guess”. Then she said it was gonna be a while before she would even help us, with an attitude!"
"""the worst experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Oklahoma City to Gainesville via Atlanta. By far the worst experience I’ve had! I’m a frequent flyer and this is the first time I’ve wrote a review. Flight was delayed twice, the connection flight has no outlets for chargers and you are paying all this money to fly. My luggage was still in Atlanta when I arrived to Gainesville which was a inconvenience to me, I had items I needed in my bag. Now I have to wait til my bag is delivered because of there mistake. I wouldn’t advise anyone to fly delta."
"""I feel unappreciated""","✅ Trip Verified | I work in Anchorage and have been commuting there and back from North Carolina every month exclusively and satisfactorily via Delta Airlines for the past eight years. However, Delta changed their mileage plan last year making it impossible to get any higher than gold status (downgraded from platinum). This made me start shopping tickets, and I noticed they were about $200 more per ticket than the next cheapest airline for months. I tried to call, and get them to price match so I could justify the $ to stay with the them, but was told they could not match prices unless it was the exact route. For someone who has been with them for so long, I feel unappreciated, and have been flying satisfactorily with American Airlines for the past couple months for much less money. Wish they tried harder to keep me."
"""seat did not seem comfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Los Angeles. First, I was impressed with Delta's new boarding process, which was by far the most organized one I have experienced at a US airport. Onboard, the 2-4-2 configuration was among my preferred one (I purposely booked flights based on the equipment). However, the seat did not seem comfortable (compare to other economy seats I've experienced). Cabin staff were courteous and pleasant. A cold meal (quite good), a separate snack service (though very small), and 3 rounds of beverage service were offered for this 5.5-hour flight; not bad at all. The IFE provided good selections, but no earphone is offered."
"""This was not a good trip this time""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Kansas City to Salt Lake with Delta Air Lines. For the amount you charge for tickets you would think you would fix items like armrests. Both were broken going to Salt Lake and on my way back to Kansas City. I could never get the app for movies to work on my way to Kansas City. This was not a good trip this time."
"""cabin service was great""","✅ Trip Verified | The cabin service was great. There were a good variety of food and drink options onboard. Cabin staff were generally nice and friendly. However, the WiFi connection in economy cabin is too weak and my phone kept losing connection and re-trying. Only when I walked towards business class did it work better. The flight was nearly one hour early on arrival. There were a lot movies but just hard to find the one you want."
"""it was good value for money""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Tokyo via Detroit. Besides the inexperienced fellow passengers who needed constant getting up and down during my flight and who shouted and laughed out loud at films, I had a terrific experience. I gave up on Delta several years ago, but booked a ticket well in advance for an extremely reasonable price. My mileage statement reflected this as I did not get 100% mileage, but it was to be expected. The flight attendants went out of their way to call me by my name, the food was good and served on Alessi service ware with real silverware (plastic cups), the AVOD has an incredible amount of movies and television shows to watch, the FA actually cleaned the toilets, and the seat comfort in premium economy was satisfying enough. We had no delays or drama on either of my journeys to and from the US from Japan. If the price is right, I will consider flying Delta again in the future as I was satisfied and felt it was good value for money."
"""far better than expected""","✅ Trip Verified | The overall online experience was awesome. Unlike domestic flights in US, Delta's cabin service on international routes (especially on those operated by its Tokyo Narita hub) is far better than expected. Both main meal and snacks were great. There were a good variety of movies. However, a search function is suggested since it's really hard to find one just by scrolling. The ground service however, could be improved. Majority of airlines operated in Changi airport offers early checkin service which allows passengers to drop their bags 24 hours in advance. It's specifically useful for early morning flights like this one."
"""never been more appalled""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline I’ve ever flown. They told us to line up by “zone” and my ticket did not have a zone. They never explained what to do if you do not have a zone. When one of the other passengers asked why we didn’t have a zone they basically told her since she bought the cheapest ticket she was boarding last. Worst customer service i have ever experienced. They also forced me to check in my bag and when I told them I had fragile objects in my suitcase, they simple told me, “then take them out.” I have never been more appalled by an airlines service. Will never fly delta or ever recommend it to family and friends"
"""particularly comfortable""","Not Verified | Ottawa to Palm Beach via New York. One of the aircraft flights was particularly comfortable (lots of leg room) Over all one of the best flights I have taken. Unfortunately before we landed back in Ottawa we had to circle several times due to an issue on the ground. However we were constantly informed which lessened any anxiety. All flights on this airline was very good. Would recommend."
"""never fly with them again""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt lake City to San Jose. The worst experience ever! Usually don't fly with Delta, but thought to give it a try. My flight was booked for Tuesday, 3pm. Got to the airport, to the gate that was on the screen. The gate doesn't show my flight, shows different flight. We started asking where is our flight information, why our flight is not on the gate screen. First, no Delta representatives were even there, finally few Delta employees showed up, nobody knows what's going on and why our flight is not on the gate's screen. The Delta representative got confused didn't understand what we were asking and multiple people were asking the same. After a while she realized what's going on but wasn't sure why our flight is not there. Then we were told that our flight was delayed by half an hour. After about an hour they told us the flight was delayed by another hour, after another hour the flight was cancelled! So frustrating! It's a short flight from SLC to SJC.. they rebooked us for 3 hours later from a different gate, far from the original. And they don't even know if they are going to make this flight. I have a midterm exam that i must attend for my school. I gave myself enough buffer from arrival to the exam time. Now I'm not gonna make it to my exam! Very stressful!! It's not a long flight (<2 hours) and with no layover. I signed for the skymiles account with Delta.. Now I'll cancel it and will never fly with them again."
"""Never flying delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Atlanta. I dont want to invest anymore time or money into Delta. Employees were not helpful and pretended not to see me while chit chatting with another employee. And when I was helped they acted annoyed. Traveling is stressful enough. Why would you treat your customers that way? Never flying delta again."
"""Most ridiculous experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Kahului to Salt Lake City. Most ridiculous experience I’ve ever had with an airline! Delta dropped the ball so many times over the last 48 hours that I’m seriously considering never using them again. I’m thankful they realized a problem with the plane before we took off, but they were seriously incompetent from that point on. We unboarded the plane around midnight, we’re told that we were on our own to find a hotel (at midnight), but they ended up helping some people secure a hotel, taxi, etc from a different kiosk. We ended up sleeping on a freezing cold concrete floor by the baggage claim, on one of the coldest night Maui has had in 10 years. It was pouring rain and windy as hell. They were actually getting snow on the peaks of Haleakala. We were told to go grab our luggage, but TSA was closed once we got down there, so we weren’t able to go back upstairs in the warm enclosure. Those who stayed up there were given blankets, pillows, and water, but the 6 of us downstairs were left to fend for ourselves. And that’s just we’re the drama began. One thing after another, over and over again, we dealt with issues from the Delta employees. People who didn’t know what they were doing whatsoever. More delays, sending info for the wrong runway, and BS from employees in Utah once we finally landed, 3 hours late, at 2:30 AM. 48 hours of no sleep, rude and ignorant employees, and no info relayed to those of us on the flight. Let’s just say that I’m glad to be home! They need more training on how to deal with these kind of situations, and if you’re going to be able to compensate some, you need to compensate all."
"""very disappointed with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | I am very disappointed in flying with Delta today. I was flying back home to Tampa from Chattanooga with connecting flight in Atlanta. The flight out of Chattanooga was delayed that caused me to not get to Atlanta and off the plane until 5:23pm and my flight left at 5:29p. There was 0 communication between anyone to alert the next flight that there were multiple people that were coming from the delayed flight to hold or wait or do something so that we could all make it on the next flight out to Tampa. 27 people waiting on stand by for the next flight out. It's absolutely ridiculous that Delta did nothing to help their passengers get to original flight or help with getting on an additional flight out that was guaranteed a spot. I am beyond irritated with this airline, Southwest would have offered more assistance and help, I'm surprised Delta did not."
"""it has no customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Rochester. Delta Air Lines is by far the worst experience I’ve had in many years of travel. Out of four legs of flights in a round trip, 3 were delayed, one by over an hour. In an attempt to reschedule one of my flights for a more advantageous time, I was told by a very rude gate agent that nothing could be done without being a platinum member. In a phone conversation involving the same issue, the agent hung up on me with no provocation. This airline does not have poor customer service, it has no customer service. I will avoid flying Delta at all costs in the future."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Boise to Punta Cana via Minneapolis / Atlanta. I have had multiple bad experiences with Delta, however, I have never written a review. Everyone has a bad day, right? Well this last time was it for us. We will never fly Delta again if we can help it. Our luggage was list, however, that wasn’t the problem. How it was handled was the problem. We got the run around a lot while in a foreign country, and are still dealing with things a few weeks later. Supporting businesses that care for their customers is very important to me. Clearly it wasn’t important for Delta. We did have kind personnel on most of the flights, and some of the customer representatives were nice. Unfortunately not all were, but the main issue lies with Delta and their policies and procedures. I wouldn’t recommend Delta to anyone I know."
"""put the cabin at ease""","✅ Trip Verified | Tonight my wife and I were on flight DL2784 from Atlanta to Seattle Tacoma. Before departure the pilot notified the passengers and crew there would be flurries on decent and landing. Well, mother nature had a little more snow in store for flight 2784. Just east of Seatle we were flying in blinding snow with an uncomfortable amount of turbulant air but the crew and the pilots were cool under pressure and their calm demeanor coupled with their preparedness put the cabin at ease. The pilots have nerves of steel and a flawless job landing the aircraft in snow and ice."
"""worst flying experience""","Not Verified | Seattle to Detroit. This has been the worst flying experience I’ve ever had in my life. They boarded the plane, drove to the runway, and turned around due to bad weather. The pilot never made any announcement about what was going on and we were on the runway for 2 hours for a 3.5 hour flight! They deplaned us and were not accommodating. The plane got delayed from 10:55 pm to 11:30 am the next day. They made all of the passengers sleep in the airport unless they paid for a hotel on their own. After all of the delays the staff managed to mess up my delayed boarding pass and didn’t even book a connecting flight like they told me. I only knew it wasn’t booked because I wasn’t confident and double checked. I will never fly with them again and neither should you!"
"""choose another airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Albeqerque. Here we go again with Delta! Delayed, then made it to the plane, pushed back, now back in the airport again. Possibly changing planes. I would say this is unbelievable, but this is par for the course with Delta. If you don’t have to fly Delta, choose another airline. Anything else would be an improvement."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Mexico City. We originally booked a flight from BWI to Merida Mexico for my godson's wedding. Delta canceled the flight and a representative from Delta rebooked us on a flight from BWI to Atlanta to Mexico city to merida. When we checked our flight the night before we joked that Delta was offering up to $500 to give up your seat. It was imperative for us to be in Merida by 5 pm for the rehearsal and dinner so that was not an option. On the leg of the flight from Atlanta to mexico city we only had a half hour to get from terminal A to terminal F. Atlanta is a large airport and we had to get from one side to the other. We arrived at the gate 15 minutes prior to departure. The delta rep at the gate said our seats had been sold and we needed to get on another flight. The next flight to Mexico city wasnt until 4 hours later and the flight from mexico city was also much later. Long story short we did not arrive in Merida until 230 am the next day. Needless to say we missed the wedding rehearsal and dinner. We filed a complaint with Delta and their canned response was basically saying that they were disappointed we had a bad experience and sorry their agent was not accommodating and they were forwarding our complaint to customer service. We will never fly Delta again"
"""two best flight attendants""","✅ Trip Verified | Rome to Atlanta. Had the two best flight attendants ever. There was a guy that refused to get out of my assigned seat even after both staff asked politely. Without causing a ruckus they directed me to a new seat which was even better with more leg room which is a premium for me since I’m very tall. They didn’t have to do what they did and I know plenty of flight attendants who would’ve handled the situation completely differently. I am very grateful!"
"""I am furious""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Orlando. They delayed my flight over 3 hours because of a “clamp” replacement that I’m sure is a very common and simple fix. After wasting half my day, they gave me a bag of unsalted almonds and said “we apologize”. Needless to say I am furious and my daughter’s trip to Disney World was ruined by their incompetence. Don’t use this airline if you can avoid it. You may end up wasting hundreds or thousands of dollars."
"""did not compensate my loss""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Atlanta. Coming from SFO, I had a layover in Atlanta before arriving in Burlington. My flight was scheduled to land at 10:20pm but we did not get to the plane until close to 11pm. After getting off the plane, I waited for awhile and I did not see my luggage. By the time my luggage was located at the service desk, it was already 12am and I was told that my luggage did not get delivered and was still in Atlanta. It was freezing cold in Vermont, I did not have my luggage or any change of clothes. I had work in the morning and was notified that my luggage would arrive by 10am. My luggage did not get delivered to my hotel until 5pm the next day, which surpassed the 6hour. The company did not compensate my loss with anything. No extra miles, ride to my hotel, or anything to help me get through the freezing cold weather. By the time I found news of my luggage, everything was closed already. If I didn't already have an account with Delta or if the flights to Vermont was limited, I would definitely choose another Airline. But after this experience, I don't think I would want to fly with Delta again."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Punta Cana to Des Moines via Atlanta. Our plane took off from Atlanta and made it to Des Moines then was turned around and sent back to Atlanta because of weather. Not Deltas fault at all. But when we got back to Atlanta we were told the flight would be leaving in the morning and they weren’t going to do anything for us so we just had to sleep in the airport. Then the next morning we get on the plane and have to wait for almost an hour because they couldn’t seem to coordinate filling the plane back up with fuel from the previous night! Evidently 8 hours isn’t enough time to put some fuel in an airplane. When we finally made it to Des Moines the 2nd time they told us we couldn’t land again and we were running out of fuel so we could only wait for 45 minutes before we’d have to re route to St Louis. An hour went by and we still couldn’t land so we ended up in Kansas City where they told us we weren’t allowed off the plane. Then it turned into oh you can get off but can’t get back on. Then it was “if we can’t land in Des Moines this time we are going to Atlanta so if you want off get off and we will pull your checked bags.” So we got off and inside the airport we were told to go to ticketing to have our bags pulled from the plane. At ticketing we were told to go to the baggage office. At the baggage office we were told “sorry you aren’t getting your bags. They’ll be wherever the plane ends up.” Which at this time was looking like it was going to be Atlanta. So naturally we went back to the plane where they told us sorry you already got off and there’s no way we can get you your bag. Delta has been nothing but horrible and unorganized through this whole thing and never has been able to help us out or do anything for us. I will never fly Delta again."
"""very unpleasant stewardess""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Lexington. We were on one of those rare flights with lots of room. My daughter and I moved to empty seats opposite each other, the stewardess asked and said we had to pay more for those empty seats and made us move back (even tho a minute earlier I watched the gate agent give a free upgrade to a gal boarding). The stewardess was unpleasant, not only ordered us back to our assigned seats but also made several others move, even just across the aisle. What was also interesting is I asked her name and she pulled her smock/jacket over where I could see her badge, reached down and tucked the badge completely out of reach. I moved one seat back so my daughter and I could each have separate rows and she made me move back “someone is sitting in that seat” which of course was a lie as no one boarded. An unpleasant experience with an very unpleasant stewardess."
"""no compassion with this company""","✅ Trip Verified | Due to weather I needed to change a flight reservation. After what I had already paid for the ticket they required a $200 change fee. Now I could understand if I was canceling to go with another airline or cancel altogether. I sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours and now the needs of the trip have changed due to flight delays etc. I understand this is no ones fault, but I don't understand when seats are available on another flight, same day, just different time they charge especially with a 24 hour notice! I will definitely reconsider flights in the future as no one plans for a needed change, but there is also no compassion with this company!"
"""Communicated with passengers""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Minneapolis. PIC Excellent. Communicated directly with passengers with conditions, delays, what they were doing and why. He cane out and spoke directly to us and offered to answer questions."
"""not impressed with Delta's new flagship""","✅ Trip Verified | I've flown Delta's new A350 at least 8 times in the past year on transatlantic and transpacific routes from Detroit to China and Europe. I am not impressed with Delta's new flagship. In economy class, the aisles are very narrow and you are constantly getting bumped by flight attendants and passengers if you're in the aisle seat. Seats themselves are narrower than on other Delta aircraft, although legroom is adequate. The number of bathrooms in economy is seriously inadequate. Most disturbing, though, is the quality of the interior. It is very evident that costs were cut, as things are breaking down quickly. On this current flight, the window shade was stuck in the closed position as it looked like it was off-track. On another flight, it was a broken lavatory door. On a third flight, the lavatory light didn't work so you had to use the facility in total darkness. And most annoying, the entertainment system didn't work on yet another flight so all passengers were out of luck, no compensation was offered. I'm a Delta Platinum Medallion member and at the point where I'm purposely seeking out either A330 or 777 aircraft on my frequent trips to Europe where possible. Those older aircraft are more spacious and comfortable, and their interior fittings much more durable and reliable. It will be a sad day when the A350 replaces these other aircraft unless Delta does something to improve it."
"""a truly satisfying trip""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to New York JFK. Cheerful, friendly crew; on time flights; generous and helpful inflight service; and orderly boarding — all combined to make for a truly satisfying trip. I am traveling on Delta more frequently and noticing continuing improvements. On these non stop flights we had two runs of beverages and snacks service - four choices from peanuts, Kind bar, cookies and pretzel mix! Attendants helped with stashing bags and winter jackets into overhead compartments. Personal entertainment screens were easy to use - a good selection of current movies. On the way out, they had no earphones to give out and I had not brought my own - so missed out on the entertainment. On the return, head phones were sold for two dollars! Both arrivals were ahead of schedule. Easy, comfortable trip from NYC to SLC in larger aircraft. Delta is the best option for this route."
"""didn’t hold it for 10 minutes""","Not Verified | Boston to Salt Lake City via Raleigh. Our plane from Boston was 10 minutes late and the put in a holding pattern over Raleigh so when we landed our connection to SLC had already left 5 min ahead of schedule. Even though there were 6 of us in the flight they didn’t hold it for 10 minutes for us even though Delta caused the delay. I didn’t get to SLC until 24 hours later. Not happy."
"""this trip was a shocker""","Not Verified | My husband and I had flown Delta to Seattle for holiday. I had previously flown Delta and loved the airline and had often paid more to book with Delta. But,I hadn't traveled via air for about 3 years so this trip was a shocker. The day of our return flight was foggy earlier in the day. Flights had been delayed earlier but not bad and I had flown in much worse fog before. Our flight was in the evening and it hadn't been foggy for at least 6 hours. However, about an hour before our departure Delta canceled a few flights including ours. They rebooked us on a flight leaving at about 11am the next morning and handed us meal vouchers that only covered a basic Subway sandwich with old browning veges. We asked the Delta agent for help and were booked on a flight that was leaving that night but the agent said it was weird because only about 5 other passengers were booked. We thought that was great of Delta to open another flight and expected the flight to fill quickly with the other stranded passengers. But a few minutes later we saw a man with a Delta badge approach the agent and tell her the flight was only to transport a pilot and co pilot with a full sized empty plane to salt lake city (our destination) and no passengers were allowed because there wasn't a flight crew. Why was that flight allowed to leave and not ours? Why didn't Delta scramble and come up with a crew for that flight!? What a waste. I'm not a crier, especially in public but I couldn't hold back the tears and it's not like there is anywhere secluded to go in an airport for privacy. So my husband and I had to stay the night in the airport and watched for openings on earlier flights. Thankfully we found a flight out at about 6am but we were up all night hungry, exhausted and I was completely humiliated. I had also called Delta's customer service asking for help but they said to talk with the agent at the airport. It was especially important for us to get back to Salt Lake because I had a surgery consultation at 10am in Salt Lake, that I had been waiting about 5 months for. We went straight from the airport to the appointment disheveled and gross. Ironically my appointment was for my foot which was swollen like a melon after sitting in the airport for over 12 hours. I used to recommend Delta to everyone but they've changed. I won't fly Delta and do yourself a favor and choose an airline that at least pretends to care."
"""I am truly disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight was delayed leaving Birmingham and We were told multiple times by the flight crew that we would make our flights. My son was on my connecting flight in Atlanta and he told the gate agent we were on the ground and that I had his heart medication. I ran to the plane and the door was shut a minute before I got there which was Still prior to when the flight was scheduled to leave. The gate agent rudely told me that if I flew more often I would understand the flight rules to close the door 10 minutes before departure time. I am a silver delta member and have flown Delta for over 25 years. Even when I had choices on other airlines I would do my best to select Delta over American. That now has obviously changed. This was the worst experience I have ever experienced with Delta or any other airline. I am truly disappointed."
"""mistake booking a flight""","✅ Trip Verified | I (possibly Delta) made a mistake booking a flight. I was looking to go to NJ for my aunt's funeral on 1/22/ to 1/24/2019. I never booked that flight. I was also looking to book a flight for 2/1/2019 to Orlando for my nephew's birthday. I thought I booked that flight. Today, my niece asked me to send her my flight information, and when I went to do so, I realized my trip is to NJ, not Orlando. I called Delta and explained the mistake. I booked this 4 days ago. Delta won't do anything. So that's $416 lost. No refund, no credit, no partial credit. Now the flights to Orlando are much higher-at least on Delta. I am a Skymiles member as well as a Skymiles credit card holder. That does not mean much to Delta. My husband, a Platinum member, insists we fly Delta even when the flights are more money. I suppose we will be taking some separate flights in the future."
"""one of the worst airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta is hands down one of the worst airlines I have ever flown. Not only were none of their representives helpful when it came to the multiple re-routings of our gate, our flight was delayed 12 hours and no one could help us figure out our next flight time or where we would be sleeping for the night. Now that we are finally on the plane after waiting 12 hours and 34 min, there are technical difficulties and we will have to unboard the plane. I can not emphasize more how disappointing this airline experience has been."
"""Delta came through!""","Not Verified | I flew into Las Vegas from the UK. My luggage was checked all the way through to my final destination, San Diego. But my luggage from the UK did not make it to San Diego. There were several of us flying the exact UK to Vegas to San Diego flight and none of us had our luggage in San Diego. At the lost/delayed baggage office they took our details and they told us that the bag would be delivered to my house by 11pm that night. Frankly I was really sceptical but the bag was delivered that night by 11 pm, just as promised. I was really impressed. At the end of day, it was only a tiny inconvenience and they really did exactly what they said they would do. Things can happen at 1st port of entry into the USA which can cause onward baggage delays (like government shutdown, for instance). That’s not the airline’s fault, but what they do after something like this, is what really counts. And Delta came through!"
"""never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Paris. I bought my ticket from e dreams and for the first time in 13 years travelling to the USA yearly was I charged for my bags. My first bag. Bags total cost $114.00. Staff of Delta at both airports were surprised that I had to pay and I was the only passenger paying for my first bag. The lively lady in Kansas even went to ask her supervisor. So Delta allows nasty edreams to do this? I paid 1300.00 for my ticket so not cheap. Will never fly Delta again and want you all to check this airline before you book"
"""staff very welcoming""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Palm Beach. Easy ticket buying online no extra or hidden fees that I stumbled upon. Very comfortable seats with personal entertainment systems (that didn’t have an extra cost!) flight staff very welcoming. 10/10 will recommend and fly again"
""" never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Columbus to Detroit. I will never ever fly Delta again! I had a 33 min layover and my Delta flight was late (sat on the runway for a good 15 min) I ran through the airport to get to the gate. The plane was there, others from my previous flight that ran were there, but the gate was closed. They were loading our bags on the plane but shut the gate before we had a chance to get on. But have no worry, they have another flight in 6 hours! I was meeting my husband (who is out of town for work) for our anniversary today. Now we both get to have our anniversary dinner alone. I will never fly Delta again."
"""never travel with Delta again""","Not Verified | Boston to St Louis where I had halt in Michigan for an hour. Due to the bad weather, the flight departure got delayed and I was obviously late to catch the next flight in Michigan. I checked with Delta support and they gave me a 20% coupon for a hotel and booked my flight the next day. So, which means I had to pay for all the expenses including transport to go the hotel, food, and hotel charge with 20% discount. They only mentioned they cannot do anything if they delay the departure time because of the weather. This is highly disappointing. I will never travel with Delta again and will not recommend to my friends too. Worst management of all flights."
"""should have seated us together""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Phoenix. I bought tickets a few months ago for my girlfriend and I. I get our tickets and realized that my girlfriend and I will be sitting in separate seats. I asked the person at the gate if there were any available seats where we can sit together and the person couldn’t find any. If I’m buying a few months in advance and the tickets were bought together, then the airline should have seated us together."
"""moves my paid for chosen seat""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Detroit. Delta moves my paid for chosen seat again. Tired of this airline. I need an aisle seat so they move me to a window seat. We pay to choose seats and they move us anyways. I have been flying Spirit more and I will keep doing so."
"""treat passengers with contempt""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to London. Delta Air Lines are supposed to be an American flag carrier, and they promote their Delta One business class product as a premier class. First, the Delta Lounge at JFK is nothing short of disgusting. The lounge itself is shabby, and the queue to the bar was massive. Upon finally getting to the bar, the staff try to charge you for the drinks. The food, (help yourself), is truly of such poor quality you would not feed to your dog. Served on paper bowls, from school meal-esque vats, of some kind of watery curry on boiled rice. The flight itself was dreadful, onboard some ancient, Airbus 330-200, presumably inherited from USAir. Terrible crew, who merely served the meal as quickly as possible, and then disappeared to the galley. The meal, per se, was ghastly. I have flown American Airlines, British Airways, and Virgin Atlantic trans-Atlantic, and Delta Airlines set the new low standard; not Business Class, but no class whatsoever. Delta treat their passengers with contempt, by offering this rubbish service. The seat comfort was unbearable too."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","✅ Trip Verified | London to Salt Lake City. I had not flown Delta for over 20 years, and only did so due to the Virgin Atlantic code share. I was intrigued to try their much vaunted Delta One business class. The aircraft was an old B-767-300, which was in awful shape. The so-called business class was atrocious, and must be at least 20 years out of date. I thought British Airways Club Class was bad, but this was worse. The food onboard was inedible, and the wine selection poor. The ONLY good thing about Delta Airlines, was the use of the Virgin Atlantic Upper Class lounge at Heathrow. Other than that, there was nothing to commend about this flight, or indeed this airline. Why to American carriers persist with such ancient aircraft trans-Atlantic, and their incredibly uncomfortable business class seats."
"""lost my business for good""","✅ Trip Verified | Spokane to Salt Lake City via Albuquerque. Delta left us stranded at 9pm. I was with a minor child. Delta offered no compensation for food or hotel. We missed our connecting flight after being delayed due to fire smoke. They only offered to put us on a flight the next day. Delta said they only offer vouchers, if the delay's are weather related. Fire smoke in the air, should be considered weather related. Delta lost my business for good."
"""Delta is the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to Atlanta via Key West. I have had a terrible experience flying with this airline. I have traveled all over and Delta is the worst! Where do I start? Purchased tickets with customer service by phone asked for 2 seats right beside each other and specifically asked how many pieces of luggage each passenger can check in? The sales agent responded 2 bags each for first class! The next day we went to the Delta counter to board our flight and the counter agent only said that we were aloud 1 bag to Key West. Had to leave a piece of luggage the airport! Boarded the plane to find out that our seats were not together! Landed at Atlanta airport to eventually find out that our connecting flight was cancelled! Had to get a taxi to a hotel that was discounted and not paid and only having the clothes that we were wearing and nothing else! We left at 3:00am to catch our flight for 5:30am! The Delta agents advised us that we will not receive new boarding passes and that we will have to use our existing boarding passes from the day before, needless to say I had a terrible experience with security because our boarding passes were for yesterday. I finally boarded the plane to find out that the piolets did not receive to necessary paperwork to fly to Key West! We waited 1 hour for someone to hand deliver the paperwork while on the runway. Finally landed in Key West to find out that my luggage and clothing was soaked! Still having issues with baggage claims. They rejected my claim stating that the verbal claim was put in Dec 2nd 2018 when I purchased my tickets December 19th and actually did not land in Key West till Dec 21st when I called about my luggage. Spoke to an escalation manager and they could not believe the inept the claim department is."
"""Air steward conduct was mixed""","✅ Trip Verified | Guatemala to Baltimore Washington via Atlanta. Check in staff at all airports were excellent, professional and helpful (including Dulles where we started from). Boarding was done in an organized way. We bought our tickets online and it was not clear that we had to pay extra for each bag. Two flights (Dulles to Atlanta and Atlanta to Guatemala just before Christmas) were seriously overbooked and that contributed to significant delays. Air steward conduct was mixed. On the way there, all the stewards were friendly and courteous. On the way back from Guatemala city, the male steward in economy was grumpy and unhelpful. The final straw was near and of flight when he trapped me in a by now dirty bathroom with urine on floor by not moving his beverage-snacks cart and continuing to unload his trays. When he continued unloading, I insisted he move his cart and let me out. Customers should not have to demand to be allowed out of dirty bathrooms. There was no apology. The other airline stewards were not polite or friendly when we disembarked at Atlanta. One Asian stewardess was kind to our daughter though and gave her extra cookies as she was hungry. However, on the next flight from Atlanta to Baltimore all the stewards in both first class and economy were very gracious to economy passengers as well. Food was terrible on all flights. I have never experienced international flights with such poor food options (poor quality cookies and snacks). We could only buy a box of decent snacks on one flight. Food options definitely need to be vastly improved especially on international flights. Overall, much to be commended but also much to be improved."
"""Service is very low standard""","✅ Trip Verified | We booked a Virgin Premium Economy Flight from Los Angles to Sydney. When we boarded to our surprise it was a Delta Air Lines Plane and we were given seating grade equivalent to Virgin`s Economy X. Not what we paid for. The Service is very low standard compered to Virgin`s Premium Economy. Firstly the pillow had dirty marks and hair all over it, but they were able to find me a clean one. The seats are narrower than Virgin`s Premium Economy. The hostess admitted she did not know the difference between the food packages and was handing out different ones to what passengers asked for. She rips them open to see & check if she got the right one. I got a ripped open one, no bother complaining. The bread rolls they brought around were literally rock cakes. Coffee served was cold and to get anything extra to drink was very difficult. When the hostess finally brought some water around she split it over me. Every seat is supposed to have a travel pack and mine missed out, no big deal but just part of the low grade service and care. The pocket that holds the instructions etc, still had the previous passengers rubbish. No Do Not Wake Signs as other Airlines have, so when you take off at 10.45 pm you do not really want to be disturbed 4-5 hours later, but Delta does. I suggest Delta Airlines stick to domestic travel in USA & Canada what they do good at, But with International Travel their service including Staff, Seating, Passenger Comforts, Quality of Food is flat out getting 1 Star. Warning : Check who you book with and make sure you are not transferred to Delta Air lines."
"""disdain and arrogance""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Delta Comfort+ from Springfield to Greenville via Atlanta. Flight delayed in Springfield 7 times. First explanation was a weather issue then changed to a maintenance issue then to a crew timed out issue at which point it became obvious it was nothing more than a lying issue. Connecting flight in Atlanta leaves on time at 10:29 pm, unfortunately we do not arrive until 11:30 pm. Directed to 3 different agent locations then to Baggage Claim area. Approximately 150 people standing in line at midnight after being stranded by Delta. After 2 hrs of standing we are close enough to make out the Delta employee stating that Delta will rebook your flight and nothing more. Someone asked about overnight accommodations and was told there were plenty of chairs in the terminal. Another person asked for a meal voucher and was told Delta does not provide meal vouchers. It was suggested that if anyone got a hotel room they could try to apply for up to $100 in reimbursement after the first of the year. After watching the Delta agents treatment of the customers in front of them and twice hearing an agent tell a customer they did not like their attitude and would have them arrested we exited the line. I am not adept at kissing someone's butt while they treat me like an animal and it had become apparent that Delta's agents were fully aware that passengers have no legal recourse against Delta and they did not hesitate to pass that along with a heaping serving of disdain and arrogance. During this fine example of ""Special Services"" Delta continued to be consistent with the emails telling me how sorry they were for the delay and how they care about their customers. New flight leaving 8:55 am next day. Delayed twice because the Flight attendants were reported by the gate attendant at 8:45 am as being in the airport but did not show up at the gate until after 9:30. Possibly they were in time out like the ones the day before. All in all our 6 hour flight only took 32 hrs to complete and the depths of Delta's incessantly repeated ""The most important connections we make aren't between places. They're between people"" really applies."
"""What a great experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Mexico City. My husband and I were traveling to Cancun to celebrate our marriage with our friends and family. I was extremely happy with the customer service from the minute we walked up to the counter to getting our bags at the terminal. Staff were so gracious and very attentive. Big smiles and super professionals. You want to greeted like you are a valued customer no matter what seat you buy. I was impressed. We expressed how stressed out we were about one particular bag (wedding dress) making there with no issues, they assured us that it would get there and not to worry. When we got to Cancun, our bag had a priority tag. They really made us feel special. Thank you ladies for being true professionals and great at your job. We need more people like you! Moving forward I will fly Delta because of our experience. What a great experience!"
"""Very lousy customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to San Jose. Very lousy customer service and no respect for their economy travelers. They did not assign us any seats upfront. Checked in very early online but could not pick our seat. At the airport, the Delta airline agent told me that Economy cannot pick their seats. You would need to wait and as we are boarding the plane, they assigned us the seats and we were seated at the very end of the plane where the rows do not recline back because they are positioned against the wall. This seating craziness is unheard of. You either give the passengers the first come first serve like Southwest or allow people to checking online and choose whatever is available at the time they are. On both flights of this trip they also checked in our carry on at the boarding because they say they are running out of space for carry on and the plane carry on space seemed to have available space when the plane door was closed."
"""attitude and lack of confidence""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Salt Lake City. I could not be more disgusted with an attitude and lack of confidence check in. Over an hour and a half in a bag check line with over half of the agent stations empty. A nonsensical woman walking around telling people who are going to miss their flight they should have gotten there earlier. What a waste of oxygen. I just have one thing to say to people thinking about booking a flight on Delta, don't."
"""never want to fly with Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Oklahoma City to Atlanta. Delta Air Lines said 2 months ago that they credited my account for another flight, but now, the day before, are telling me that they didn't and can't do that. So their first Customer Service representative told me false information and then they told me today to use it or lose it. Now I'm giving it away because we can't use it. I loved Delta, but now I’ve been completely lied to by them and they didn’t take ownership of it. I never want to fly with Delta again because of this."
"""sassy and give attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Albany via Atlanta. Everything’s great except for the customer service reps at the desks in front of the gate. If I ask “how are you”, please dont just stare at me blankly if I’m trying to be nice. Don’t be sassy and give attitude when I ask for my ticket to be printed. I had no seat number. Usually fly Southwest and wish I had."
"""I’m so done with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to LaGuardia. I’ve flown Delta Air Lines many times but usually they are okay. However, this particular experience was absolutely horrible to say The least. I flight that was supposed to leave at 3pm, didn’t leave until almost 6pm. They didnt offer us drinks as we wait almost an hour in the plane. Terrible service. I’m so done with delta."
"""Worst customer service""","Not Verified | Seattle to Atlanta via Orlando. Worst customer service and airline I have ever experienced. We bought our tickets June 2018 for December 20th 2018. The flight was changed more than 6 times and eventually cancelled making us reschedule and forcing us to change plans. The non stop flight we bought was changed to a connecting flight. The first flight was 2 hours late, making us miss the connecting flight. We were told oh well and scheduled in the afternoon to our destination. We were supposed to arrive in Orlando at 6 am originally and after everything, we arrived after 6pm. They also lost our baggage. Customer service didn't accommodate, didn't give us the time of day when we expressed concerns, and when we asked for a supervisor, we waited 15 minutes and eventually walked away because they never showed up. If you can, do not fly Delta. They are awful!"
"""not be flying Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Cleveland to Seattle via Atlanta. Extremely disappointed with the ground crew and maintenance of Delta in Cleveland. Had to abort flight just before we got to the end of runway due to a maintenance error that was not even clarified on. We ended up spending about 2 hours in the plane with no AC as a result. I made it to my next Delta flight destination with 3 min to spare, only to be told I can’t go on the plane 100ft in front of me. It may have been a different story if the ground crew was not so lackadaisical back in Cleveland. Will not be flying Delta again."
"""the service is horrible""","Not Verified | Raleigh Durham to Detroit. Got to say that the service is horrible. I can't get over the fact that the flight was delayed twice leaving RDU. This is known by the airline yet zero effort is made to make connections. We made it to the gate with 10 minutes before take off. Plane at the gate and no agent around. That is the first issue. Why is no one at the gate? I have to track down an agent. They should have been waiting for at arrival. Next she speaks with the gate agent while he is closing the door. I am a customer service manager, this would not be at all acceptable in my industry. Worst ever. I feel as though the airline broke their contact and left me the passenger out in the cold."
"""Absolutely the worst ever""","Not Verified | Burlington to Nassau. Absolutely the worst ever! We thought we were in First class what a joke! Rude employees, they ran out of meals. Flying with Delta was a horrible way to start my vacation with my husband. The first class is not separate from coach so if you are flying do not waste your money, fly another airline."
"""there's no customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Montego Bay to Atlanta. Air France flight operated by Delta. Our flight on November 12, 2018 was planned for 4:42pm. Due to a technical issue, the plane didn't take off and another one was sent from Atlanta. The so-called ""rescue"" plane didn't take off from ATL before 8pm and we only left MBJ at 00:15 on the 13th. In consequence we spent the whole day at the airport (we arrived at 2:15pm). We weren't offered to stay in a hotel close by and I even had to ask the staff for something to eat. We landed in Atlanta around 3am and were charged a no show fee at the hotel. We also had to pay for the transport to the hotel as airport shuttles don't run at this time. AF customer service that's supposed to take care of that refused to compensate us as it is a US company operating a US flight. Doesn't matter that we booked from Air France. Is it really our problem that they delegate the flight to a partner? Even scarier: that ""technical"" issue was apparently a leak that prevented the plane to take off, however the plane just flew from ATL. So, there's no customer service but there's also no maintenance!? Cheap ass airline we will never fly again."
"""kind and generous act""","Not Verified | Greensboro to Atlanta via St louis. On this trip, I arrived on Greensboro nc to start my flight, I didnt notice until I was at the airport that my extra luggage was severely damaged (possibly from my last flight with delta), however I did not mention that to them because I didnt know if they did it or the bag was just worn. So the lady took my bag and said she would tape it and send it to St Louis, my final arriving spot. After leaving Atlanta and getting to St louis, they had my bag beside the claims department, no surprise because I had a stop in Atlanta. When I told them I was picking the bag up they wheeled out a brand new luggage with tags on it of 160.00 and said Merry Christmas, we want you to travel safely next time. I was in shock, o had never said a word to them about my bag. Not only did it make my day and Christmas, it totally turned my neutral thoughts on Delta, and they made a customer that will continue to use them, and I will not forget what they did for me. Thank you Delta for a kind and generous act."
"""I am outraged""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Salt Lake City. I had a terrible experience. Delta made me check in my carryon bag and I have had traumatic experiences with this in the past. I was then seated in a row behind my partner when it could have been avoided. Probably just wanted us to pay the extra fee. I am outraged."
"""unprofessional customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Houston. My family and I experienced unprofessional customer service by the flight attendants of this flight. My family and I had a very rough ten hour trip on our first flight since we had a connecting flight from AeroMexico to Atlanta. We did not expect this type of treatment. During the one hour flight from Atlanta to Houston we experienced behavior that consisted of loud conversations in the back of the plane and rude responses when ask to be attended. By rude responses we would be answered with words such as ""cool"" and ""move"". At some point my family and I didn't even want to be approach by them, that's the kind of discomfort we felt to display towards them. The pilot on the other hand gave us a smooth flight and accommodation."
"""likely not fly with you again""","✅ Trip Verified | Orange Country to Seattle. An employee at Santa Ana Airport Delta check-in whose rudeness and customer service were to a point that is ridiculous and unacceptable. She rudely explained to me they had to check every higher class guests before me, so I kept waiting. A while later a third employee came out (now there were 3 lines) and signaled me to come up. Not longer than four seconds after I came up, the other agent proceeded to cut off our conversation and almost yelled at my face, ""I already told you many times we have to help all higher class guests before you, why do you keep asking."" And let's not mention customer service yet, even on the normal basis, politeness between two humans, she does not have! A customer does not deserve basic polite interaction between humans, because of economy class? Thanks very much Delta, I will most likely not fly with you again to avoid headaches like this."
"""the experience was good""","Not Verified | Travelled from Tokyo to Honolulu on Delta Air Lines Boeing 767-300. It was about 7 hours flight. A comfortable one - Staff was nice and courteous - food (AVML) was good, well the choice could have been better but then it is all personal - and most of the facilities including entertainment were also good. The seat spacing was okay but then you have to adjust somewhere when you travel economy. Checkin facilities were also up to the mark. On the whole the experience was good."
"""crew was professional and friendly""","✅ Trip Verified | Paris to Raleigh Durham. Flight left and arrived on time. Cabin crew was professional and friendly. Pilots provided flight info and alerted passengers when turbulence was expected. The flight attendants handed out a printed flight schedule and menu outlining when services would be provided and they followed through on this. Lunch had three options, mid flight snack was a warm chocolate chip cookie and two options for pre-arrival snack. During the flight, the attendants came through three or four times to offer water. At the end of the flight, flight attendants came through the main cabin thanking passengers for flying Delta and handing out candy. The experience was very nice and a cut above the Air France flight we had from FRA to CDG to connect with this flight. In-flight experience noticeably better than other legacy carriers I have flown in the past year. The flights to FRA (RDU-DTW then DTW-FRA) were also good. Delta has a new safety video which also presents a very positive image about travel and connecting with family and friends and is very nice to see."
"""terrible customer service""","Not Verified | Raleigh Durham to Detroit. I understand weather delays but, you shouldn't have your customers sit on a plane for 2+ hours after being delayed 2 hours and seating at the terminal. You should have better communication with the airport and ground crew. This is just overall terrible customer service."
"""not able to use the business lounge""","✅ Trip Verified | We split our time between France and US. So we fly quite often between the two, and we also travel a lot for leisure. So we decided to use around the world tickets, the advantage being it allows you to make stops, change flight schedules etc. without penalties. Additionally, we opted to go Business class with 1st class flights with the latter being carriers who do not have business class. There is an unspoken expectation that if you upgrade, you will be allowed to use the lounge. Long story short, wrong. We flew from Paris to Detroit. Stopped in Detroit, MI for a few days, then flew to Reno, NV. We were able to use the business lounge in Paris, but not able to use the business lounge in Detroit, stating that we could only use it if we continue on to Reno on the same day. Or basically flying continuously around the world? WTF? I am not trying to be entitled or ask for special treatment, but when you pay for business or first class tickets, there is an expectation that you can use the lounges. So I tweeted to Delta and they asked me to PM them with my complaint/feedback. Response I got, it’s basically their policy, and they’re not making exceptions. Again, I was not asking for special treatment nor do I feel as though I am entitled, but there is an expectation when you pay 3-times that of economy. I write this to let other’s know, because you have choices for around the world tickets. I like flying business because, call it paranoia, but I like being at the airport early so as not to miss my flight, and having the comfort of these lounges. Delta really needs to look at their “around the world policy” as it relates to usage of their lounge. This is the response I got from Delta. “Thanks for your patience, Randy. I have further reviewed policies and we strongly enforce these guidelines. Please know we regret the disappointment as we value your business and choice of airline. Applying for the Delta American Express Card or buying a Membership is also another option. You can find further details on the link I provided for you earlier. *AST” If using lounges is important to you, then please check the individual airlines policies first."
"""Worst flying experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | I’ve never written a review before but service was so terrible I vowed to write to Delta. My wife suggested this forum. I have flown all over the world and there are always small problems. This was different. This airline flew me to my destination and then back to Seattle without any explanations. No offer of hotel or accommodations. Just a long stay in the airport with a ""too bad, so sad attitude by staff"". Also destroyed my luggage in such a way to completely remove an entire corner. I will never ever use this airline again. Worst flying experience ever."
"""fallen of a cliff""","Not Verified | Delta service quality and customer care has fallen of a cliff. I am a Diamond 1.5 million miler and I fly at least 4 flights with them every week. So I have s lot of experience to compare. They say they appreciate loyalty but they sure don’t show it. And they certainly don’t seem to appreciate those who don’t fly as much. I get better service on American as a Platinum frequent flyer than I do with Delta. Hello American!"
"""given special attention by staff""","Not Verified | Portland to Seattle. Special thanks to all the staff. While it was a very short flight I had been feeling ill and was given special attention by staff who checked on me constantly and helped me with the luggage and information. You have all been truly amazing and I cannot thank you enough."
"""missing my connecting flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Detroit. Wow am I upset with this airline. Staff at front desk told me to not worry about missing my connecting flight as I had plenty of time. Here I am still sitting on the plane. They told me 20 extra minutes due to snow preparation. 30 minutes later I have not gotten an update. Will be missing my connecting flight during a very emotional time for my family. Never ever again will I fly this airline that could care less about their passengers and where they need to be"
"""never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Charlotte. I will never fly Delta again. The trip out was a nightmare. The trip home was even worse. The attendant had an attitude and raised her voice at me. The bags that are considered carry on and were not a problem on our Delta flight out are now an issue and we were told we should have paid to have them checked. Never again. Flying isn’t a cheap venture and I will go spend my couple hundred dollars elsewhere."
"""Delta man at gate was rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Jacksonville to Atlanta. Good: seats were surprisingly spacious; actually had some foot room. Plane was clean and seemed fairly new. Poor: original flight delayed; caught another flight. missed connecting flight even though they said: “connecting flight knows you have landed. It is possible they will wait for you, but go fast!” We did. Ran all the way to tram!train then to connecting gate. Delta man at gate was rude. Just kept saying “plane is gone” (sign said now boarding). We almost fainted from running. He never even looked at us. Just kept repeating “plane is gone” as we tried to catch our breath. Did receive overnight accommodations after asking. We felt we (the passengers) were quite an inconvenience to the man at the gate."
"""horrible experience with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | I was flying from Boise to LAX with a layover in Salt Lake City flight 1211 nov 28 departing at 8:25 which gave me 45 minutes to catch the connecting flight. Delta had one delay after another, but fortunately I received a text that flight 1211 was delayed to 8:40. Our plane from Idaho landed at 8:15 and I made a mad dash across multiple terminals and arrived at my gate at 8:21. The plane door was still open and I saw the last few people enter the plane and the attendant said I was too late. In short. The flight attendant saw me, ignored me and was very rude when I approached her. She made no effort to accommodate me and simply scheduled me for a flight arriving at almost midnight. Both attendants were a disgrace. I had a horrible experience with Delta, between delays and rude people."
"""paid for our Premium Economy upgrade""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Newport News. On boarding the aircraft the pilot stated that there a possibility of turbulent weather entourage. For that reason it was unsafe for beverage service an all flight attendants would remain seated. Into the flight we noticed First Class was served snacks and multiple beverages. The remainder of the aircraft was offered water after First Class was done. This is wrong we had paid for our Premium Economy upgrade."
"""delays cost me over 13 hours""","✅ Trip Verified | This airline severely mishandled the winter storm that came in. For starters, a message notifying of my delayed flight was not sent until I was on my way to the airport, a trip about 1.5 hours with the road conditions. I arrived about 1.5 hours before my flight departed, so this was less than a 3 hour window. About half way to the airport, I was notified of a 2 hour delay. This was understandable given the conditions. However, Delta kept pushing back the flight at that point in 1 and 0.5 hour increments all the way until 5:40. In this time, all I could do was wait. While Delta did provide food for the many people waiting, it certainly was not very good (cheap pizza and water) and not enough for everyone. They even ran out of plates for people. Finally, when the plane arrived, the passengers were told that the crew could no longer work, and we were forced to wait another 3.5 hours while they tried to find a crew. Given they knew about this storm and the delay, they should have been aware of the crew's inability to work more hours and have a standby crew ready. After finally boarding the plane at 9pm, almost 12 hours after arriving at the airport, the passengers learned we still didn't have a co-pilot and were forced to wait another 1.5 hours. Even after finally landing it took an additional 10 minutes than normal because there were problems getting the hallway for people to get off to work. Overall these delays cost me over 13 hours, and I missed a class and a fairly important meeting. This management is inexcusable by an airline, and now I know to avoid flying Delta when possible."
"""no inflight service""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Atlanta. My husband and I bought our tickets way in advance, not only that, but we also precheked the day before. We were assigned separate seats, why? Not only that, but when we approached the counter at gate 76, the Delta staff was extremely rude, Unaccommodating and unsympathetic. I am extremely angry! Oh, and by the way, as a cherry on top of this unpalatable “ice cream” there was no inflight service."
"""Being polite costs nothing""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight attendant was really rude. I was flying from Seattle to Sacramento and the cabin bag was not fitting inside. The attendant asked me to take of the stuff from the bag and asked me to hold it. I took out the laptop and charger and when I was doing it, she was yelling. She asked me to put the laptop on floor and she yelled so loud that everyone turned back and started watching. Being polite to people costs nothing but makes a better world Delta should do a better job in hiring!"
"""Never fly Delta again!""","✅ Trip Verified | I was supposed to fly from Toronto to New York and then New York to Boston. I arrived 5 hours early at the airport to make sure I have enough time for everything. The flight got delayed 4 times since then! And it was for reasons such as ""the crew wasn't ready, the baggage guys messed up"" etc. Completely unprofessional! When I landed in New York, the flight to Boston had already left and it was the last one for the day. They put me on a flight in the morning and told me they don't provide any hotel, accommodation, lounge, no compensation! I am currently sitting in the chairs of the airport, having spent 9 hours already for what was supposed to be 3-4 hours journey, and it will be 12 hours more until I am finally home. I am tired, hungry, smelly, sleepy, my body's aching and I'm furious about the way they treat people. Never fly Delta again!"
"""doesn’t care about you""","✅ Trip Verified | Greenville to Detroit. Horrible customer service! I already had my bag check paid for and checked in online. They had no one to give my bag to so I had to wait in a huge line to give them my bag and when I did, they wouldn’t take my bag because I was 2 minutes past the half an hour mark before my flight! That’s right, 2 minutes! Rather than trying to be helpful, they refused to take my bag and made me switch my flight, which is 6 hours after my original flight. If you don’t have money & fly priority, Delta doesn’t care about you and will not do a thing to help you!"
"""Very very frustrated""","✅ Trip Verified | Richmond to Cancun via Atlanta booked for January 2018. Extremely disappointed with Delta. My husband and I were planning to go to Mexico for our honeymoon, and we decided to purchase insurance - well it turns out the insurance is completely useless unless you are rich and fly first class. I am so angry; why do you offer insurance if it does not protect your trip? Mexico is very unsafe right now, and we don’t feel comfortable going anymore, but they will do absolutely nothing for us, not even change the flight to a different location. Not to mention, we fly quite often and 9 times out of 10 Delta’s planes are ALWAYS delayed! We have the delta credit card which has been pretty nice so far, but I am very sorry to say we will be canceling it, and not flying Delta as first choice any longer. Very very frustrated."
"""Thank you to the workers""","✅ Trip Verified | Birmingham to Charleston with a layover in Atlanta. My flight took off 45 minutes late in Birmingham due to icing. We landed in Atlanta with fifteen minutes before my next flight took off. I was the last person to be seated on my connecting flight and a couple of minutes later the doors closed. Somehow those guys were able to get my luggage on my connecting flight. Thank you very much to the workers who were able to get my luggage to the next plane. Not having my luggage would have been very inconvenient."
"""they took care of us""","✅ Trip Verified | Saskatoon to Honolulu via Minneapolis / SFO On the 2nd Oct. my wife and I flew from Saskatoon to MSP with Delta's regional carrier and I must say it was a very pleasant experience. Arrival in MSP and went through Customs with a long layover. We arrived at our gate for our flight to LAX only to learn that the flight was being delayed due to mechanical issues. It was later delayed again which would result in us missing our connection in LAX to HNL. We were told to proceed to Delta Operations and they would arrange flights for us to HNL. They arranged a flight to SFO on DELTA and a flight from SFO to HNL with Alaska Airlines. In the end we arrived on time as originally scheduled. However my bag did not arrive. The baggage attendant in HNL took all the necessary documentation required for missing luggage and advised that it would arrive the following day. She advised that we could purchase items that I would require in the interim. My luggage did arrive late the following evening 3rd Oct. Delta reimbursed us for the Comfort seating which we had purchased along with the late luggage, in a very timely manner. We will no doubt fly with Delta again as they took care of us. The lady at Delta Operations was very nice for being under a great deal of pressure from a number of other passengers on the same cancelled flight."
"""luggage lost for a month""","✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew from Minneapolis to Singapore with Delta. Mistakes happen in life, and this time Delta made a (from my understanding) fairly rare error resulting in my luggage being lost for a month. I realize this happens from time to, but expect when it does for it to be handled professionally. I have never seen such inadequate and unprofessional management of what one would assume to be a simple situation. Repeatedly my Delta agent simply ignored my requests for information related what Delta was offering to cover and what they were denying—I still have no idea what exactly is being covered. Furthermore, the agent ignored my requests for a phone call--when she final addressed the request she said the time difference was too great despite my offering to take the call at any time no matter how inconvenient it was for me. I had to drive the entire conversation with the agent frequently taking over a week to get back to me even after multiple follow-up emails from my end. I spent about 15 hours of my own time handling this situation and in the end Delta provided me with a $250 voucher for the $2,000+ ticket and is covering 75% of my cost and the damage to my personal things. If Delta actively employees a strategy of confusion and incompetence to reduce costs, they nailed this case."
"""not be flying with them again""","Not Verified | Denver to New York. I had a pleasant trip flying into NYC but I tried extending my trip and the customer service rep and supervisor couldn't help me. Even though I was willing to pay more to push back my flight they were not helpful at all. I understand I didnt click a certain button when I bought the ticket but I wasn't aware I couldn't move my flight for that reason alone. How is Delta suppose to keep my business if they aren't willing to help a first time flyer. I will not be flying with them again due to this. Customer service is to help not to deny. Especially when I want asking for the end of the world. I'm pretty sure the supervisor could have helped me but her instant ""NO"" was very rude and unnecessary especially when I'm sure she could override the system. Lost a customer due to that."
"""Horrendous experience""","✅ Trip Verified | New Orleans to Baltimore via Atlanta. Horrendous experience. Delayed arrival into ATL and that is the worst airport for connections. I barely made my connection, but not without running and taking a spill in an escalator. Learned my lesson. I’ll pay more for a different airline, especially one that doesn’t connect through ATL."
"""Terrible customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Phoenix. Terrible customer service. In order for you to find a charge to get your miles back. You have to go through 5 steps in order to find it. I canceled previously and never got charged. But now they wanted to charge me. Inconsistencies. I will never book through Delta again once my miles are up."
"""most incompetent airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to San Francisco. I’ve flown over 100 times and this weekend is the first time I’ve used Delta. One of the most regrettable travel decisions I’ve ever made. They are the most incompetent airline available. It’s impossible for them to do their jobs properly so that’s people may have a stress free trip."
"""felt crunched in Seat 1A""","✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo Narita to Manila. Couldn't believe the difference between Delta One published pictures of the seat area and the real thing! It was really small. I felt crunched in Seat 1A. The lay flat seat was not very comfortable. Flight Attendants looked really good in their new pink outfits, and they seemed ok, but a little distant. Food was horrible -I had some kind of chicken ""blob"" with a mashed ""sweet potato"". The IFE was severely lacking with only about 18 movies offered, and the screen was tiny. Compare this to Philippine Airlines with approximately 100 movies available."
"""They are so inefficient""","Not Verified | Flew Oakland to Salt Lake City. Stop adding more boarding zones. Other airlines have a 30 minute flight turn around (land, deplane, clean, and board). Delta has trouble just boarding a jet in under 45 minutes. They are so inefficient."
"""wouldn't recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. I bought mine and my son tickets together. I've never been separated from anyone I've flown with. He is 13 yrs old with severe anxiety issues. I'm told they have no seats to put us together and I've spent the last 30 mins trying to call him down. I don't care if he is old enough in your terms to fly alone. Mentally he is not! I have never been so unhappy with an airline. This is unacceptable in my book! I wouldn't recommend anyone flying with children that they consider old enough to fly on their own with any type of disability or concerns with their mental health to fly this airline!"
"""if it’s really going to takeoff ""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Phoenix. I have only flown Delta twice in the last year. The last time I flew in the entire flight was canceled and today I have no idea what time I’m going to land because it’s currently posted at an hour and a half late but departure time is still two hours away so who knows if it’s really going to takeoff or not. I’m not asking for champagne on my flight, I’m simply asking that the flight departs and lands in some semblance of the scheduled time. All I ask."
"""worst airline of them all""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta is the worst airline of them all. Spend extra money to avoid flying with them. During my most recent trip, all three of my flights were delayed. One was on account of weather, which was not Delta’s fault. Telling me and everyone else with connecting flights that we had been “rebooked” when in fact we had not was certainly delta’s fault. They did this for the other two delays that were undoubtedly delta’s doing and had nothing to do with weather. Each leg involved hours upon hours of trying to find a delta phone operator who felt like rebooking my flight. When I finally made it to my destination, I was informed that delta had sent my bags (which would have come in handy for my two-week vacation) the opposite direction all the way back to Detroit. No airport nor telephone staff could divine the location of my bags for about two days. Really consider avoiding Delta at all costs, even if it’s domestic"
"""thankful for the simplicity""","✅ Trip Verified | After having numerous problems with a different airline flying from Milan to Baltimore including multiple delays, I was going to be missing my Delta flight from Baltimore. Because it was a different airline that was causing me to miss my Delta flight, I was worried that Delta would make me buy a new ticket to get home. I contacted them via Twitter and ended up messaging with someone who was extremely helpful and put me on the next flight from Baltimore no questions asked. I’m very thankful for the simplicity and ease Delta provided by putting me on a new flight."
"""worst travel experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Austin to Seattle. Just had the worst travel experience of my 50 years on delta. Flight supposed to leave at 6 am and repeatedly delayed until now scheduled to leave at 8:30 pm. Gate attendants gave few updates and the ones they gave were misrepresentations. Most recently, they said flight was pulling up to gate and would board at 3:30 but then 2 minutes later delayed another 4 hours. Because of the misleading information provided all day we missed the opportunity to book on other flights and so incurred significant losses in hotels and other travel costs. When I asked for compensation they offered to reimburse the flight and give me $100. This does not even cover my actual out of pocket financial loss much less the inconvenience and mistreatment."
"""nothing but issues""","Not Verified | St. Thomas to Washington via New York. Worst airline ever! I’ve had nothing but issues with them every single time I’ve flown with this airline. At STT, the Delta crew were all on extended break and took their own time to show up to finally start checking bags. Once the flight arrived at JFK, it took an hour to make it to the gate. We kept being told “5-10 mins”. Then we find out our connecting flight had been cancelled. Delta felt they did us a favor by rebooking a flight for us- that went out the following day - late evening - with another layover. After several errors on Delta’s customer service to book us a better flight- we finally thought we were on our way home after 6 hours - for that flight to also keep getting delayed. All Delta flights were extremely delayed. Some because they were “waiting on the flight crew to arrive”. This airline doesn’t even attempt to accommodate considerably or appropriately for their negligence or error. I’ve always had the worst experiences with Delta and we will not allow them another chance. Other airlines seem to have more helpful employees and operate much more smoothly - making their airlines much more dependable"
"""Shockingly awful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Toronto to St. Louis via Detroit. Shockingly awful experience and further validation why I try to avoid Delta. Booked a flight to make a birthday 75th birthday dinner for my dad. My first flight (Delta) was delayed significantly by 1.5+ hours. When we landed at the connecting terminal, Detroit, I asked the flight attendant to let the second flight (also Delta) know we arrived as we had 10 minutes until takeoff. She shrugged and said it would be fine and to run. I and several other passengers ran to the gate for the second flight and the airplane was gated but we weren’t allowed on it. See below pictures of the airplane at the gate that everyone on the first flight was denied entry. I could not make the birthday dinner party with the other flight offered and asked for a refund and to be returned home. I was told I would not be refunded and to go home I would need to purchase another ticket. Absolutely shocking! Delta: 1) did not communicate with itself about the connecting flight being delayed. 2) when explicitly asked to notify the gate refused to do so. 3) when I asked to go home and be refunded was told I had to buy my own ticket home and no refund so it is cheaper for me to sit here in the airport, fly to St. Louis, then fly back to Toronto."
"""most disrespectful treatment""","✅ Trip Verified | Panama to Amsterdam via Atlanta, connecting to Dublin with KLM. Worst most disrespectful treatment by gate/ground staff I've ever had in a airline anywhere. Suffice it to say the following that occurred to us, a family who was on a trip that we saved thousands for with a terminally ill family member trying to make memories To have it ruined at the last minute and have bad memories of it is extremely unacceptable. First was called by Delta the partner in the flight with KLM, called and told us they were changing our flight with a 24 hr lay over ""as crew couldn't find a place to stay for the night in Panama City due to the storm"". Never mind that we looked up and found several places on the beach. In any event, this meant we would have to add another day of expense and change our flights to 5:55 AM, meaning we also lost all ability to submit our VAT refunds among other things, but the worst was yet to come. On checking in the 'lady' at the gate told us we could not carry on our policy size and weight carry on bags, as the ""flight was full"", yet the bags had important medical equipment, medicines and fragile expensive goods that we had no ability to lock up as we were told the bags would be able to be carried on. If the bags were lost or damaged replacing the equipment and meds would be extremely hard even once back home. The worst part-every other passenger behind us and at other gates for the same flight were being allowed to carry on their bags as advertised. CWhen confronted about why this was the case the gate attendant told us ""call direct if you like its in the policy fine print, we can do this to you"" She then became belligerent and gave one word answers, didnt look at us and said 'next"". When I tried to ask if wheelchair assistance had been confirmed, she spouted off a series of gate numbers where I could go ask for a wheelchair, and rushed us out of line. I then returned to the gate as her info wasn't sufficient, and asked another gate attendant who simply stuck her finger in the air and said ""over there somewhere"" and didn't even look at us. Wheelchair assistance either wasn't at the gates or was very late and we had short connect flights and couldn't just hope it showed up. My son and wife had to almost carry me at a run to the next gate. The only connection this didn't happen at was Atlanta and then only because we we hunted down a wheelchair attendant when ours wasn't there. The gate attendants were disrespectful, dismissive, and left us genuinely concerned given my inability to walk the distances due to legitimate neurological disease for which I carried medical proof- They forced us to check bags that others were carrying on board -passengers of the same ticket class as us. In fact nearly every other passenger boarding had their bags, The only difference in us and other passengers. -we had a disabled passenger. Thanks KLM for taking what should have been a good memory for our family with thousands of dollars of expense and sending my family home stressed, insulted, worried and upset. Never again."
"""They are just awful""","✅ Trip Verified | Indianapolis to Atlanta. They are just awful, they cancelled my flight 3 times spent over an hour to get rebooked. Changed my route completely and also gave me the middle seat even though I specially told them I needed a window seat. Apparently booking 2-3 months ahead of time does not mean anything. First time and probably my last."
"""experience was deplorable""","Not Verified | San Antonio to Los Angeles. My Delta experience was simply deplorable. My flight was delayed until me the next day and they kept on canceling our flight until we were told there was a 12 am flight. I waited only for the flight to be canceled due to excessive flight hours by the crew. It was impossible that they did not know this when they told us that a 12 am flight from LAX was coming. I injured my left toe due to the chaos by other passengers catching the hotel shuttle and today I received a message from the Delta Customer Service that it was an unfortunate incident and I cannot be compensated when that was not even what I was asking for! The crew the next day said they were waiting for notification from Delta and were told that the flight was canceled and the crew verified that they did not work excessive hours!! Imagine our disappointment. I just think that the blatant disregard by Delta about their passengers is deplorable. No compassion. Total dishonesty. Just disappointing. Useless upgrade. Simply disappointing!"
"""worst travel experience""","Not Verified | Des Moines to Columbus. This has been by far the worst travel experience of my life and I fly a lot. My flight from Columbus to Des Moines 1276 was delayed from 12:20 to 8 pm, we had to switch flights. Then on the way home from Des Moines to Columbus our flight 6008 was again delayed from 10pm to potentially being cancelled the plane we are currently waiting on is sitting in Louisville and we are in Detroit. My internet didn’t work on flight 1532. The seats are smaller than Southwest and American. And the beverage service was slow. By the time I got my drink we were almost landed. Delta is by far the worst and I will never travel with them again and I will be telling everyone I know not to utilize them either. On top of everything the staff is extremely rude and not empathetic at all. Stay away from Delta."
"""refused to give me mileage credit""","✅ Trip Verified | Athens to Sarasota via Amsterdam / Atlanta. Delta has refused to give me mileage credit for a flight to Europe. Apparently their ""partner"" KLM somehow snagged the miles even though I booked through Delta. Delta wouldn't help me. I needed the mileage to maintain my medallion status. I don't want it now. I am done with Delta. I am done paying premium prices to get ripped off. There are many, many cheaper ways to fly to Europe now. No more Bad Delta for me."
"""seat space was tiny""","✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo Narita to Manila. Flight crew looked very professional and were polite. Food was horrible, it was a southwestern US meal (?) and consisted of a hard corn mix, some kind of potatoes or starch, and chicken blob. The Delta One seat space was tiny! Not like any picture I have seen before as I made my selection to fly Delta."
"""motivated and extremely attentive""","Not Verified | Dublin to New York JFK. The crew were caring, motivated and extremely attentive. On board my flight there was a small mix up of vegan and vegetarian meals, the crew noticed how I had received a vegan meal and not a vegetarian meal and within 60 seconds they handed me a vegetarian meal that was for everyone on board the flight! Refreshment’s were handed out on a regular basis but you could request at any time! Flight left 14 minute’s early and arrived 70 minute’s early! Everyone on board recieved a clean blanket and a pillow that was surprisingly comfortable! The entertainment was decent with lot’s of great music to listen too! A huge selection of movie’s and series was available with a flight-map! I would be extremely happy to fly Delta again."
"""Very poor service""","Not Verified | Flew Los Angeles to New York JFK with Delta Air Lines. Very poor service. I had to check in my only bag when everyone else had more then two. I also had to wait because the overhead compartment was broken which should of been taken care of before we got on the plane."
"""Do not use this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Boston. Awful! Do not fly with this company, yesterday on my way to Boston the flight was delayed, we boarded, there was no room for even routine carry on luggage, we waited on the plane for over an hour, then deplaned only to reboard 50 minutes later! Now I’m sitting here in Philadelphia, plane was supposed to depart at six and here I am at 6:36 writing this review, again after receiving notice that the carry ons will once again need to be checked in. Do not use this airline or things will never improve!"
"""they wouldn’t serve peanuts""","✅ Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Minneapolis. For the most part I have had good experiences with Delta. Except this last time. My daughter has a peanut allergy and I made sure to tell the lady at the front desk before we boarded the plane. She even let me board early to clean my 3 year olds area to prevent any reaction to the peanuts. She also told me that I would have nothing to worry about and they wouldn’t serve peanuts on the plane. I even told the flight attendants as I got on the plane. But, as the flight attendants are coming by with snacks I over heard her ask the lady across from me if she wanted peanuts. I then asked her if she was serving them. She turned red and realized she messed up. Peanut allergies are very serious. She came back and told me they would give me a 25 dollar Visa card to come to my email for the inconvenience. I think it was totally not responsible of the entire staff working considering I told everyone before boarding the plane."
"""absolutely disgusted""","✅ Trip Verified | My fiancée and I booked what would have been a once-in-a-lifetime trip from Dulles-IAD through Atlanta to Key West, through Delta. We did everything in our power to make it right. We booked seven months in advance and showed up at the airport four hours early. But then Delta delayed our connecting flight causing us to arrive late to Atlanta, then they rescheduled, and rescheduled, and rescheduled, and changed the gate, and changed the gate, leaving us stranded wandering around Atlanta while they figured out they couldn't get us to our destination. After a day stuck in the Atlanta airport we finally manged to catch a redeye back to DC, only to have them lose all of our bags in the process. I would call their level of incompetence criminal, only criminals would be more organized than this. We're out thousands of dollars and absolutely disgusted. How can anyone be this disorganized? We will never fly again due to this experience."
"""forget any thoughts of sleeping""","Not Verified | Buy an expensive ticket or be prepared for your punishment! I have flown in a more comfortable fairground ride. You will be crammed with a seat pitch lower than that of a standard UK domestic flight. The seats are hard and forget any thoughts of sleeping if you are flying home from the USA. If you don’t buy an expensive seat everyone who boards ahead of you will ram the aisles so be prepared for a bore of a boarding process. Forget overhead locker space as Premium economy holders occupy the overhead lockers back to the wings. The staff are excellent with a good sense of humour and I had a good joke with them about how passengers are treated at ‘this end’ of the airplane. I accept that I paid a low fare and can expect cattle class but you will literally have less space than EU regulations require cattle to be afforded as they are transported to the abattoir. The worst part is that I actually booked a Virgin flight but apparently as a Virgin Partner its the luck of the drawer. It’s like going to an expensive concert only to find out it’s actually a tribute act! Oh My God, what have I done!"
"""older, worn down 767""","✅ Trip Verified | Another older, worn down 767 on a Delta International Flight. That makes a perfect trifecta for the year, London, Paris and Narita/Singapore. All with run down 767's, full of flat hard cushions, broken USB ports, glitchy touch screens that take you 15 minutes to select a movie. Last week they only had enough meals for half of coach. They blamed it on the contractor who provides the meals, although it could have been caught if they had checked it. Their inability to board a flight on time probably precludes the Flight Attendants from being able to double check the ""Contractors"". Thank goodness for their partner airlines, like KLM, they have newer planes, and are much more pleasant to fly. I see no value in being a Diamond Medallion on Delta Airlines. Stick with the discount airlines, at least you know what you are getting. Signed, Delta Diamond."
"""Food and service were decent""","✅ Trip Verified | I always have mixed feelings about Delta's 767-300ER. It (and 767 in general) has the best economy seating arrangement of 2-3-2. However, the aircraft is loud and the overhead bins are small. IFE on this particular aircraft was good, with a nice selection of movies (this has been my positive impression about Delta). Food and service were decent, as expected from the airline. My flight was diverted due to bad weather in NYC (sounds familiar?), and this, of course, was not the airline's fault. In fact, the crew did a good job updating us about status and showed effort to get us to JFK as fast as they could."
"""Delta is a pleasant airline""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to Frankfurt. When I left the Sky Club in JFK terminal 4 and headed to the nearby gate roughly 10 minutes before boarding, I got a text from Delta that the departure gate was changed. It was a non-issue unless the new gate was in terminal 2, and the only way to get there was by bus. To make things more confusing, the text did not advise me where I could take the bus, which departed from another gate. When I made to T2, an old, small and overcrowding facility, the flight was delayed because they needed to transfer the food, which had already been loaded to the original aircraft at the original gate, to the new aircraft (?). I ended up arriving at Frankfurt late, and the delay was not caused by weather or any technical issue. Reading many reviews here, one can easily notice that many complains about US carriers are about delays and how the airlines handle the situation, and that was what exactly happened here with Delta. The 767 perhaps has the best economy class seating arrangement, with only 1 per row that is not either a window or an aisle seat. The 767-400 used for my flight had the old version of IFE which was not that great (Delta's 767-300ER had better, newer IFE). I paid for wifi (the free version never works) and it worked fine. Service and food were fine. Crew distributed bottle water after meal (without us asking) which I think was a nice touch for us to stay hydrated throughout the flight. Overall, without the ground service issue, Delta is a pleasant airline to fly with."
"""I had a great experience""","Not Verified | Buffalo to San Antonio. I had a great experience, especially when compared to my flight back home with American Airlines. The attendants were humorous and made conversation with those of us flying which made a big difference (ex: joking and having character.) There were a few snack choices, and the plane ride was smooth. It was a bit more expensive than AA, but I'd use Delta again for these reasons! Secondary flight was a few minutes delayed, but that's understandable (there was bad weather in ATL.) Also appreciated the free access to Facebook messenger - it helped me to stay in contact with a loved one and it was 100% free."
"""received are two No Reply emails""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Milwaukee. Apparently when climbing into my window seat my iPhone dropped out of my pocket onto the Aisle seat. When that seat's occupant boarded she assumed it was left by someone from the previous flight and, without checking with those around her, turned it into the Flight Attendant. I discovered this when we landed and I realized my phone was missing. The Flight Attendant explained that he'd given it to the Gate Attendant back in Atlanta, and even provided her name. He provided all the information from the flight and as soon as I arrived home I filled out the online information. All I have received are two ""No Reply"" emails explaining that once three weeks elapse they stop looking. Today is three weeks."
"""Terrible customer service""","Not Verified | Indianapolis to West Palm Beach. Terrible customer service, pathetic seats each flight leaving and returning. Rude gate personnel and I was told seats would be changed once arrival to gate only to be rudely told no seat changes allowed! Will never fly Delta ever again!! Southwest puts Delta to shame!!"
"""Leg space very short""","Not Verified | Denver to New York with Delta Air Lines. Carry on baggage very small. Leg space very short not good for tall people. Customer service not so good attitude. Assigned seat available is last row and seat pocket with old dirty plastics and food."
"""service was phenomenal""","✅ Trip Verified | Memphis to Milwaukee. Customer service was phenomenal, flights were on time going to and from, and planes were nice spacious and clean. I haven’t flown Delta lately but will definitely fly again in the future!"
"""worst experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Honolulu to Los Angeles. This has had to be the worst experience ever! My Flight was delayed 4 hours with multiple gate changes. I arrived at 11:30am and their crew was super rude, didn’t not want to answer any questions! Several people given upgrades and when I inquired she refused to help me! This customer service was garbage. I had family flying Hawaiian Airlines at the same time and they were also delayed but they were on their way at 3:45pm, also with $200 credit for another flight ! It was so disorganized and crew abuses power. Horrible! horrible ! If you can fly Hawaiian or Alaska airlines you should do so."
"""I should have drove""","✅ Trip Verified | This was probably the smallest commercial aircraft I ever flew in. Even carryon’s had to be checked in, only personal items were allowed onboard, keep that in mind if you find yourself in one of these flights. The seat was super tiny, for a flight that lasted about 45 minutes there was really not much to complain about even though we taxied for 2.5 hours thanks to the notorious JFK runway traffic. I should have drove from Philadelphia to JFK instead of taking this flight. It was a Delta flight with a Delta branded airplane however it was operated by Canadair."
"""customer service was poor""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Seattle. One of the worst flying experiences, I was sent 5 notifications for delays. I was suppose to be flying out at 6:45 pm and they delay the flight all the way to 10:51. I can understand the delay, but customer service was poor, and they do nothing to compensate! Cheap flight with uncomfortable seats. Wish I knew better."
"""Worst airline I have ever flown""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Los Angeles. While checking in for my flight I opted for the option to check a bag in. This cost $25. I decided to carry on my bags instead so I just proceeded to the flight. I was assured by the lady who checks in bags that I’d be able to call after my trip and get my refund. I was not able to do this when I called in. They said that according to their systems I had apparently checked in a bag. This was incorrect. They then attempted to hand me off to their baggage handling service line to get more baggage history. Shouldn’t getting their things together correctly be their job? The flight itself was horrible. I checked in a day early to ensure me and my fiancé had seats together and when the actual flight came they tried to switch my seat without asking me or even telling me that my seat had changed. They had even threatened to kick me off the flight. What for? Their mistake? Worst airline I have ever flown with."
"""Horrible service!""","✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Los Angeles. The flight leader started out not serving beverages on the ground in San Jose Costa Rica. Then we heard that Costa Rica does not have bottled waters, so only plastic cups could be filled. After begrudgingly taking our drink orders in first class the beverages were slammed on our trays without a please or thank you. This is a 5.5 hour flight and for most of it the FA was nowhere to be seen. We finally found her sitting in a comfort seat in 17A. After 3 hours of being thirsty I finally walked to economy class and asked the FAs there for sodas. Even after telling then that we had no service in 1st class I was just given a ""oh sorry"" which did me no good. The FA further was unable to give the correct coats (from coat check) back to the proper passengers because it would have required her actually labeling them or tracking them. This woman clearly did not want to do her job. She works in the wrong industry and gives Delta a bad name. She was based out of LA and had the attitude to go with it. Horrible service!"
"""meal was restaurant-quality""","✅ Trip Verified | Madison to Orange County via Minneapolis. First leg of the outbound was delayed on the tarmac due to flow control into Delta's Minneapolis hub, where I was to transfer. Apparently this is not uncommon, so one wonders if the airline should adjust its schedule accordingly -- perhaps by disallowing short layovers -- which is the reason for an imperfect score. I arrived at MSP about 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to depart. The Delta app said my gate was a 12-minute walk. However, I'd gate-checked my bag, so I was still in jeopardy of missing the connection. When I stepped off the plane I was met in the jetway by a Delta staffer who solved all my problems by escorting me to a car on the tarmac, where we grabbed my bag from the baggage handler, and shot off through a tunnel under the C and G concourses, directly to my connection. I had 10-15 minutes to spare. To top off this good experience, the Asian vegetarian meal they served was restaurant-quality -- delicious and healthy. Good job, Delta. (I am a Delta elite frequent flyer, so YMMV.)"
"""worst crew and flight""","✅ Trip Verified | La Guardia to Fort Lauderdale. This is the worst crew and flight I ever had. Specially because I bought more than one ticket and ask for specific help because I have back problems and they don’t even care about the client. I won’t be buying any of this airline flights because is always a problem, this is the third time I use this airline and always a problem and rude. We specially ask before anything and the first time they gave me a emergency seat. Now I do have the las line and also my back is with problems. Very rude, and not organized. Never again. Worst airline."
"""the scheduling was so bad""","Not Verified | Boston to Bemidji via Minneapolis. Every experience I’ve had with Delta has been frustrating. This last trip had us running over a mile through the Minneapolis airport for a connecting flight that should have been next-door gates. Literally not a single other plane in the airport for our 9:30 pm board time and of course our first flight was late. It was only a few minutes and still the scheduling was so bad that we had to have our next flight held as we ran toward it."
"""I at least expect a tasty meal""","✅ Trip Verified | On September 6, 2018 I travelled to Seattle with Delta Airlines Economy Class and I returned to Amsterdam Delta Airlines Business Class. The food in the Economy was better than in the business class. In the Business Class I had ravioli which was dry with a very chemical tasting kind of sauce. Afterwards I had an ice cream which I returned as well as it did not taste like vanille but like chemicals. The next meal, ""breakfast"" was cereals (too sweet) or a tortilla. I desided to take the tortilla. However, that was something made of egg powder. It was just horrible. One pays a lot to travel business class, for that money I at least expect a tasty meal. Also the personnel on my way in economy were much friendlier than the attendents in the business class who were arrogant and not very friendly. All together I will never fly Delta business class anymore!"
"""such an abysmal service""","✅ Trip Verified | Last minute ticket purchase. Boeing 757 New Orleans to Atlanta. Great flight. Transferring in Atlanta in 27 minutes was a challenge, but I made it to my flight. Older A330 to AMS. Good entertainment, tolerable seat, ok food. Horrible service. Rude, uninterested cabin crew. Haven't experienced such an abysmal service in ages. Flown Delta after that few times, and never seen such a miserable cabin crew as I've experienced on ATL - AMS flight. Otherwise nothing notable."
"""flight delayed every half hour""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Im in the airport now and the flight delayed every half hour with no excuse for 3 hours. I came to Las Vegas in same airline and a delay for 2 hours again with no mail and very bad communication and bad way. No mail sent to us and we are in the airport now for 5 hours including waiting hour for main fligh."
"""Delta is my last resort""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Des Moines. I don't know how people, particularly anyone over 6 feet tall, routinely fly on Delta. Their jets have the worst—least—amount of legroom of any airline I've flown. I'm 6'4"" with long legs, and the seat I was in had just enough space behind the seat in front of it to allow me to wedge my legs into the space, but I could not move them side to side because of the people beside me. Consequently, I had to sit for 2 hours with my knees jammed up against the seat in front of me, with all the obvious discomfort you can imagine. Luckily, the lady in front of me did not recline her seat. That would have been an even greater amount of pain. Seriously, why does Delta pack these seats so closely together? Do they not realize there are people out there taller than 5-1/2 feet? They should make one-third of the rows with larger leg room, and reserve these seats for people of a minimum height. Delta is my last resort for flying, and the only reason I had to settle for this flight was it was the only direct flight option for me. I guess I should stick to American and just accept the added hassle of connecting flights and layovers just to get a more comfortable ride. Come on, Delta!"
"""Terrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | St Louis to Knoxville via Atlanta. Terrible experience. My family exclusively flies with Southwest but they don’t fly to Knoxville. So we took a chance on Delta. Mistake. First I was separated from my 2 yo and had to spend an hour on the phone with a service rep to change our seats. Then our flight to Atlanta was delayed and we were going to miss our connection. We were told to call the rescheduling number. When we did, it took talking to a supervisor to get rescheduled. We spent 6 hrs in the airport with an upset 2 year old. And as of now we still have not boarded our new flight. In the future I will either fly southwest or drive. I will never take another flight on Delta."
"""we were vehemently denied""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta’s customer service policies for ticket changes and upgrades are “consistent”. By “consistent” I mean that my husband and I witnessed two different families receive upgrades/flight changes under exceptional circumstances, yet when we asked, at the gate, to board a non-full flight that would allow us to arrive home six hours earlier, we were vehemently denied. Denied when we checked in, denied when we spoke to the crew at our layover stop, and denied by customer service on the phone; and that was just the state-side experience. When on our international leg, our flight was originally overbooked; we went out of our way to volunteer for a later flight. The itinerary was lined up and at the last second, the staff decided they did NOT need us to switch. So there we were, having gone to the trouble of adjusting our arrival plans, only to rush to re-arrange them in the five minutes before we took off for the states. Funny how they had no trouble adjusting our itinerary twice for their own needs. As I write this, that homebound flight is leaving, with empty seats, and two fully dissatisfied customers sitting in the lobby who will forevermore go out of their way to fly anything but Delta."
"""served water for passengers""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Buffalo. Seat 21E next to window provided a nice view with almost two windows. This flight was delayed nearly 3 hours due to a big storm. Captain informed the weather information as well as delayed status of airport during waiting time in runway. Cabin crew also served water for passengers."
"""terrible for transiting""","✅ Trip Verified | Buffalo to Tokyo via Minneapolis. It was terrible for transiting at MSP overnight. Since my connecting flight to HND was in the next day, I could not check-in. There were a few seats opposite the check-in counters. I did not sleep well in these seats. However, after checked-in and cleared customs, I could go to the sleeping area which provide many mats for free."
"""I wouldn’t recommend them""","✅ Trip Verified | Portland to Raleigh Durham via Salt Lake City. Where do I start. I show up to PDX at 3:00am to check in for a 6:00am departure (I’m an early bird). I wait until 4:30am and ask when Delta reps are supposed to be out. That was supposed to happen at 4am. So, that’s strike one. Not out until 4:45am where there’s a line of at least 30 people. First flight to SLC was fine. The flight staff I liked, they were the only ones I liked. Super short layover at SLC. Get on at SLC, the new staff made a big deal about a pet and made sure I knew not to remove the dog from the crate. Land at RDU, have maybe 20 minutes to deliver a puppy, check in, and go through TSA. Oh wait, I am “too late” because I was on the plane for the last four hours and didn’t check in at least an hour in advance and my seat was given away. I had no way of checking in when phone barely receives iMessage on the free WiFi. So I get a “seat request” and am told if I’m not fast enough that I’ll have to come back out and buy a new ticket. Strike two. After TSA, I sprint to my gate where I have seconds to spare. Luckily I have a seat left. During that flight is what sealed the deal. They offer flight fuel and meals. I wanted a specific one, I was given something else. Ok, I can deal. When the flight attendants come back to collect trash and recyclables, they never took mine. Keep in mind, this is the same staff that flew from SLC to RDU, now they’re serving in the return flight. They wouldn’t refill my water. Basically refusing service, and I’m suffering from nausea (all flights prior were rough), dehydration, and exhaustion. That’s not ok. They picked and chose who to serve. I had to leave my garbage in my seat upon landing because they wouldn’t take it. I was happy to get to SLC where Delta staff had better attitudes. The flight from SLC to PDX was better. I slept. I was woken up by the landing. I was happy to be off the plane. My recommendation for Delta is nonexistent. I wouldn’t recommend them to my worst enemy. Who ever was working that flight from SLC to RDU, and returning, you displayed very poor customer service. I wasn’t the only one to notice. They act as if they’re better than everyone. Alaska is cheaper quality, but their staff is top notch and service is stellar."
"""sat for over 30 minutes with no AC""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Harrisburg. Flight was delayed due to mechanical issues, in that the Auxilliary Power Unit was not functioning. Once on the plane all passengers sat for over 30 minutes with no AC. Flight attendant script starts by thanking us for allowing them to deliver exceptional service. This is not my definition of exceptional experience. I don’t care about WiFi, or in flight entertainment, give me a comfortable environment at the very least"
"""I am really mad now""","✅ Trip Verified | When I am writing this review about my trip with Delta, I have to use my cell phone data (the hotel's wifi doesn't work). Let start with my ticket: it's a round-trip ticket from Binghampton to New Orleans and versa. The flight from Binghamton --> New Orleans was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-5 Then, this was how it happened. My first flight was delayed for 1h30min, and of course, I missed my connecting flight. I have to stay in a hotel overnight in Detroit. I don't have much time with my family this trip, and now I have to spend 1 night in the middle of nowhere. I was really mad with them, they gave me a voucher $100, and at least I felt they care about my feeling. At that point, I can rate them 4 stars. The flight was delayed, but the reaction was good. The flight from New Orleans --> Binghamton was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-10. Again, the first flight was delayed for ""2 hours"". And again, I have to stay in Detroit 1 more night. I can't imagine how my trip 5 days with 4 days with my family turned into 6 days with 3 days at home. I contacted them about my issue, now the attitude was changed, they thought that they gave me $100 voucher and it's done. I deserve to have the delay one more time ""on the same trip"". They sent me to a hotel name Travelodge, it's a very very bad hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 11:30PM and hadn't had dinner yet. I was thirsty and need some water. Since I don't have cash with me so I ask the help desk at the hotel for some water. After I said I don't have cash, she told me to drink water in the bathroom, ""it's OK!"". Now the wifi doesn't work, but I have to write this because I am really mad now. The lesson is: you may have a fault, but the way you fix it is more important. For the person who thought that $100 voucher is big, and it's ok to wait 2 nights for 2 delays on the same trip, I'm ashamed of you, you are so cheap! Thanks ""Delay"" Airline for a wonderful flight!"
"""refused to let me move""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Detroit. There was many open seats in the red section. I was one row out of the red section and was overcrowded in my seat. The flight attendant refused to let me move unless I paid to upgrade. Eleven red seats open. This will be my last time flying Delta."
"""don't treat people like that""","Not Verified | Flying from Atlanta to Richmond last night and I have never had a more unpleasant interaction with a flight attendant. Twenty minutes into the flight (after her and another stewardess sat back and gossiped) they began to serve passengers off of the beverage cart. After serving 3 quarters of the passengers, the attendant said ""Sorry, we are done."" I asked for a water and she said ""No, pilot's orders."" She later came by and asked if we had any trash to which I responded ""How could we, you didn't offer us anything?"" She asked if I was upset and I told her that I was because I just needed some water as I had traveled all day. She said to take it up with the pilot. At this point we still had half an hour until landing. Also, there was no turbulence. My Delta flier miles card is going bye-bye. You don't treat people like that."
"""obviously gone downhill""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Minneapolis. Delta used to be one of the best airlines apart from Alaska, they used to take customer service seriously. I haven’t flown much in the last several years but due to work I am beginning to travel on a weekly basis. Delta has obviously gone downhill in the last several years. Not putting families together when flying, not able to assist with seat changes to accommodate families, and this entire process change. This will be my very last flight with this company. It’s sad how they’ve taken Northwest Airlines amazing customer service aspects and simply thrown them down the drain. What a shame."
"""disappointed in Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Manchester to Birmingham via Atlanta. I arrived early in Atlanta from an 8 hour flight from the UK. I was scheduled for a 6pm flight home, but there was another flight at 4. I went to the ticket counter and asked about the earlier flight and was told I could get on it. They re-tagged my bags and I happily went through security and to my gate. When I arrived home, my bags didn't make it. I went to the Delta baggage office, and the clerk simply stated they were checked in late, they would be on the next flight and I could come back and get them. No apologies no nothing. I am most upset that the agent in Atlanta didn't say anything to me about it being late. Had I known I would have waited for my original flight. I am a Diamond member, and they can care less. Very disappointed in Delta."
"""leave on an earlier flight""","Not Verified | Lansing to SFO via Detroit. I was able to leave on an earlier flight and they had seats available but wanted to charge me the current ticket price of several hundred dollars more. Knowing they had seats and they could make a change with a few keystrokes I asked they make the change. Eventually they offered to do it for $200. $200 for what - I’m taking an empty seat."
"""had to give up our seats""","✅ Trip Verified | New Orleans to Atlanta. I was flying standby and my flight was originally supposed to be at 1154am. I was bumped off of 6 flights because of availability. It was time for the last flight out and I was very nervous. They called my name to board the plane and I was very relieved. I got settled on the plane and started reading my book. All of a sudden the flight attendant called my name and another gentleman’s name. Right before the plane was getting ready to take off they told both of us that we had to give up our seats. This was one of the most degrading experiences of my life! The supervisor made us get off the plane and give up our seats. The other person working for the airline told me she wasn’t supposed to do that because the people didn’t arrive until the plane was about to leave. This was the same supervisor that told me to board the plane. The supervisor showed no remorse whatsoever. I'd been at the airport since 930 am and now I’m going to miss work and not be able to get home to my pets! One of the delta employees that was working one of the flights I was bumped off earlier told me that the airport had an agreement with the local hotels for discounted rates for people that were displaced because of issues with flights. The supervisor told me that she was the only person I could speak with about my issue. She also didn’t mention the discounted hotel rates until I brought it up and the rates she told me were twice the amount of what the previous employee said. I understand that you aren’t guaranteed a seat flying standby but they shouldn’t treat people like they’re inferior. I also understand that people make mistakes but good companies do their best to rectify them. The supervisor I dealt with did the least she could to help me with this situation. I don’t recommend that anyone else uses Delta"
"""there is no sign of the bag""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to New York JFK . Most pathetic experience ever. My carry on bag was taken from my possession on board the flight as the overhead compartments were full. One of the hostesses came to our aid who promised to tag my bag and send it to the checked in baggage on the aircraft, of which I left total faith in the integrity of the staff. She apparently tagged my bag according to my seat number, and no receipt of this was given to me. When i disembarked the flight, while awaiting the baggage there is no sign of the bag. No one from Delta can give me any answers. It seems to be 'lost' or so im told. I have made numerous calls to the agents and i keep being told they are searching for the bag as there are many bags from Delta which are untagged. I am currently miles away from home on a holiday which i saved up for a long time, the agents tell me to go ahead and purchase whatever needs to be replaced from the bag, then i am told it will take 4 weeks for the claim to be processed and there is no guarantee it will be fully reimbursed!"
"""no food vouchers, no hotel""","Not Verified | Washington to Lexington. After delaying the flight by 5+ hours, the flight is cancelled after midnight and I am rebooked on a 6am flight. No blankets, no food vouchers, no hotel, no nothing. Turns out the 6am flight is over booked and I have no seat assignment."
"""never fly this airline again""","✅ Trip Verified | Charleston to Atlanta. I had a round trip with one lay over each way. I flew from SLC to LAX just fine, but when I flew from LAX to Orlando, I sat on the plane waiting for takeoff because there seemed to be issues with the plane. It ended up taking 2 hrs before we were able to take off, which is fine I understand things happen, and I’m glad it got taken care of (not to mention it pushed back all my plans and was very inconvenient.) Now, I’m heading back home and am making arrangements to get picked up, etc when I hear on the intercom that we can’t depart because there are more issues and it’s going to at least take an hour? Does this happen often? I’ve flown many times with other airlines, and have never experienced this, let alone back to back. I will never fly with this airline again."
"""efficiency at its lowest""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Los Angeles. This is the worst nightmare. I do consider not flying delta again. First the system was down and the fly delay 40 mins at the gate. Then when we started boarding the gate attendant insisted that I tucked my 2inch x 4inch clutch inside my bag because it is the third bag. Then we proceed on to the plane and noticed that due to runway conflict we are now going to wait for another 40mins inside the airplane. Or at least that is the minimum estimate of wait wait time. This is worst efficiency at its lowest."
"""Terrible 4.5 hr experience""","Not Verified | Detroit to Portland. My new boyfriend and i booked oir first trip together a month and a half ago, tickets booked at the same time, in one transaction, and of course we asked and assumed we would be seated together. There were plenty of open seats at the time, and when we got on the plane we were seperated, different rows and different sides, among a bunch of passengers flying solo that insisted on staying put, for no damn reason. Got our trip off to a lousy start, for absolutely no reason, such a basic thing, they scammed us, and it was completely unnecessary. I will never, never fly this hack airline again, and I recommend that you dont either, they clearly have no concern for their customers comfort or satisfaction. Terrible 4.5 hr experience."
"""Terribly slow service""","Not Verified | Dayton to Eugene. Flight was delayed no reason given. Missed connections to Eugene. Waited in line for 45 minutes to change connection. Arrived late in Eugene bag not there. Had to find an agent and another long wait. Luggage didn't arrive until 3am at the hotel. Room phone rings 3am and tell them I will get it in a few hours, ugh. Return flight same thing delay and miss connecting flight, puts me back in Dayton 11pm. Only question now is will luggage show up. Terribly slow service, delayed flights - try a different airline. Nothing offered for poor service, late flights and no luggage."
"""demanding money from older lady""","✅ Trip Verified | Lagos to Washington via Atlanta. My 83 yrs old mother was on this airline that was later reported rescheduled after I called delta airline customer service that lasted about 20 minutes. This is a terrible experience for all involved, firstly my mother is wheel chair assisted and does not speak english she was just sitting in Atlanta on a wheel chair on a spot not knowing what a heck was going on. I was waiting at Washington Dulles airport not knowing what was going on until i called the customer service and found out that the particular flight has been rescheduled without been warned. Not only that the man that was assigned to wheel mother at the Atlanta airport was actually demanding money from older lady just coming from Nigeria without local currency. This whole experience was appalling and very terrible.I really wish no other person have to go through this sort of experience."
"""food was delicious""","✅ Trip Verified | Paris to Detroit. The seat and legroom were amazing. Cabin crew was not friendly at all. The food was delicious. WIFI was so fast. Bathrooms were dirty. The landing was a bit bumpy. IFE was okay."
"""will give Delta another try""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Kalamazoo via Detroit. We had long delays on the tarmac in SFO, and missed our connecting flights in Detroit. It was long and miserable. We waited in line and communication was poor from the staff. But, Delta did redeem themselves today, and they are sending me a check to cover the hotel room I paid for out of pocket that fateful night. Too bad they didn't cover the $50 taxi bill to the hotel, or the $50 in baggage fees, but at least they made good on the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised by the good training and demeanor of staff. I will give Delta another try."
"""not fly with them ever again""","Not Verified | Delta has to be the most inefficient and useless flight in hurricane situation. I was flying from Boston to Greensboro, NC for a job interview on Friday when the hurricane is supposed to hit the region. My employer canceled the interview, but since they did not cancel the flight, I was told that this is voluntary change that I am making. Additionally, I had to fly before September 20th, since the ""bulletin"" board mentioned that is the law. 2 flaws in these statements: A bulletin board cannot determine that my flight needs to be on a certain date because that is when my employer wants to interview. I would love to fly before September 20th, but I cannot do that- that is impossible from my employer's perspective. When it is supposed to rain 20 inches and since you have not canceled the flight, does not mean that flight will not fly. Just because you dont cancel the flight does not mean that the hazard of the hurricane goes away. Extremely rude customer representatives who would argue with me about my own thought process, would not let me finish the sentence and would keep on going on and on about this supposed bulletin board that is their law. I have been a customer with Delta for over 10 years, but would not fly with them ever again."
"""expect space for overhead bin""","Not Verified | I'm told that I have to check my bag, that all overhead bins are completely full. I get to my seat and there is a completely empty bin at my seat. When your customers pay you hundreds of dollars for a seat, they expect space for the overhead bin. Especially when there actually is space available. Not wanting to lose essentials, I frantically attempted to move items to my backpack from my carry on, breaking the zipper in the process."
"""prepare to be admonished""","✅ Trip Verified | My family just traveled from Ft. Myers to Atlanta round trip on Delta. We purchased 5 economy tickets for 2 adults and 3 children. When we checked in for the first flight to ATL the counter personnel made a snide comment about our tickets being basic economy and how lucky we were to have seats in the same row. For this first leg we had 5 seats in row 40 with 1 other passenger between us. That was good and we had a fine flight. When I used the Delta mobile app to check in for our return flight to RSW, we were given 5 middle seats (737 seats b and e) throughout the plane. We didn't get 2 seats together. When travelling with children (9, 12, and 14) that is not disastrous, but still sucks. When I asked the Atlanta check in staff if there was anything they could do for us, that is when I really experienced how Delta feels about basic economy tickets. The check in person was very friendly and helpful until he saw what type of fare we had purchased. His demeanor and helpfulness completely changed as he informed us that our tickets were take any seat class. We went to customer service and received the same treatment, even after telling the rep the ages of our girls. At the gate we tried again, and this gentleman was even more discourteous. He told us he wouldn't even look to see if there were seats available for moving us. When we got on the plane (last - zone 4), several passengers saw our predicament and offered to move to accommodate us. We didn't ask them to. Nice to see there are good people flying on Delta even if the people running it are jerks. We fly often and usually on Frontier, Allegiant, Jet Blue, and Southwest Airlines without difficulty. No other airline has embarrassed me or belittled me for choosing to fly economy with them. Bottom line is, if you buy a published basic economy fare on Delta Airlines, be prepared to be admonished and treated like you don't deserve to be on their plane."
"""getting rid of the Delta card""","✅ Trip Verified | I booked a first class trip for two on Delta Airlines using my Delta Sky-miles Platinum Card. We were flying from La Guardia to Houston. It’s about a four hour flight. For me, any flight over two hours I tend to fly first class. Unless, the ticket value is exceptional. Although I’ve held this card for sometime now, I’ve only flown first class twice on Delta. I generally use Delta to fly to Atlanta, which is approximately two hours. Anyway, the trip began with the rep at the gate informing us that we wouldn’t be able to sit together due to a broken seat. I was like that blows but whatever. Then I thought to ask the Delta Rep if maybe they could simply inquire with the passenger; who one of would be sat next to, if they didn’t mind switching to a different seat (still in first class but with no on occupying the seat next to it). I was told by the Delta Rep, that I should do it myself. Which, if that’s their policy, I get! He offered no other remedy. Maybe he could’ve said: hey, I realize it’s a bit of an inconvenience, separating you and if it’s important for you to be seated together; I could move you but you’d be losing first class service (which is much on Delta anyway). I just felt that there was no regard for professionalism. It matter of fact and deal with it attitude. The kicker was this, we boarded the plane and the “first class” Stewardess was no prize either. I will give this though, she did assist in getting us seated together. She then took drink and food orders. My order was taken first. Apparently, too many people ordered the chicken salad dish. She came back to me and here’s the dialogue: I can’t give you the chicken dish, you’ll have to have the pastrami sandwich. I said well I’ll pass, because I don’t eat pastrami. But how does that work anyway, you told me my choices and I selected like everyone else? She says we ran out of the chicken. I say, but you took my order first? She says well in looking at the medallion status, you fall to the bottom. What was so crazy about that is that I purchased both first class tickets and she brings my boyfriend the chicken salad! We both laughed like hell! Again, to her defense it could only be the Delta Airline to blame. No ideal how she decided he got to eat over me though. There is clearly no training on tact or etiquette. And if I’m wrong in that statement; there is either no policy in place for common occurrences. The whole point of this review is to hopefully save anyone from wasting money on Delta first class. I’ve flown first class on American Airlines quite a few times also and have had zero complaints. Their planes even appear to be nicer. The meal thing wouldn't happen either as you select it 30 days to 24 hours before your flight. I’ll be getting rid of the Delta card. It serves no purpose."
"""disgusted by the treatment""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Santiago. I will never chose Delta to fly again. I paid for a very expensive ticket and I was treated very unfair. I was given no respect and was given no attention as a customer. I was seated twice on the plane and both times had to leave the plane because of some excuses. First they said the plane had some mechanical issues, then they said the pilot had just came from a 10 hour flight and was tired. Then they said we couldn’t leave because of bad weather, which was a complete cover up for everything else. I spent more than 24 hours at the airport and even had to sleep on the floor. I was disgusted by the treatment, attention, care, and service of Delta!"
"""No customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. Worst company and service ever. No customer service at all, no knowledge on what they are doing and no respect for people. They don't return calls, no notice or fix your ticket IF your flight gets changed because of their service. Very unprofessional"
"""Complete disaster""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Chicago. First time flying Delta. Booked first class ticket. Not informed 7.30pm flight was cancelled until arrival at JFK from an overseas flight. Cancellation was allegedly a result of poor weather (weather in NYC and Chicago were fine). Rebooked on next day midday as ""there were no more first class seats on the 8.30am flight"". No hotel accommodation or food was arranged and Delta Sky Priority staff at counter told that there would be no reimbursement because the flight cancellation was due to ""poor weather"". Mididay flight was then delayed until 1.30pm and again until 3pm. In total - a simple 2.5 hour flight resulted in an almost 24 hour delay. Complete disaster."
"""stressed by lack of care""","Not Verified | I took the flight DL422 from Sao Paulo to Berlin on August 14th with a 8 hour layover in New York. The first part of the trip was ok but unfortunately I can't say the same about the NY-Berlin portion. The flight was delayed in more than one hour and when I got to Berlin I found out my luggage had been lost. I didn't receive any support from Delta, instructions on what to do, if they were trying to track my luggage, anything. Everything I had was on my dispatched luggage, I had nothing but my passport, wallet and camera on me. When I complained about not getting any support from them, an employee gave me a toiletry kit with a small tooth brush and some shaving cream and sent me to the lost and found area of Tegel airport. After waiting in line for almost 2 hours, I was told there was nothing they could do and I should fill out a form online with my personal information and if they found my bag, they would contact me. When I tried to talk to Delta employees again, I discovered there were none at the airport anymore (it was 3 pm) and there was no one at the airport I could talk about my situation. On the following day, I returned to the airport to try to solve the situation with a Delta employee and I was told my luggage had arrived on the flight from New York that was landing at that time but they couldn't hand me my bag because it had to go through customs. After that, I kept receiving emails saying my luggage was still lost and couldn't be tracked and I should be patient. My luggage was only delivered on Wednesday of the following week. At any point I was not contacted by Delta airlines with instructions, received any support or voucher to pay for the extra expenses I had to have or even an apology note. Having spent half of my time in Berlin without my luggage seriously impacted my time there as I was always concerned that my luggage might be delivered while I was out of the house. I didn't stay at a hotel and the building didn't have a doorman and no one would be there to pick it up. I was worried about not having my things back at all as I kept getting emails saying they had no idea where my luggage was, was always uncomfortable from wearing clothes borrowed from friends and generally just stressed out by the lack of care toward me from Delta."
"""experience was outstanding""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Seattle Tacoma. My experience was outstanding from comfortable seating, online check in, the meal selection, and flight attendants. I didn't realize how amazing delta was until I took a different airline home with my 3 year old. Delta definitely has set outstanding standards thank you for making my flight to Seattle enjoyable & I got to watch all the good movies that my husband never let's me pick."
"""was very impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | Maui to Las Vegas. Was very impressed. Hurricane Lane was on its way to Hawaii. While all other airlines cancelled all flights, Delta saw it was safe to still fly in and out a little longer until the bad weather hit. The storm was about to hit us so Delta moved up the departure time about 20 minutes so we could make it out safely. We made it out of there with no complications, barely even any turbulence. We would’ve been stuck there for days if they didn’t go the extra mile to get us out of there."
"""Delta receives a big fat F!""","✅ Trip Verified | Oh Delta! To begin, all my flights were on time. Stewardesses were pleasant. Except when one decided it was ok to tell me that I’d be much prettier if I didn’t have on my beanie hat. But I degress. My sole complaint is about every single solitary employee I came in contact with whether at ticketing or the gate. All of them were unwelcoming, stood with a sour look on their face, had a lack of personality and enthusiasm for their jobs, didn’t make customers feel appreciated and made me feel like I was bothering them if I asked them a question. Whew! From someone who is in the hospitality industry and understands the importance of customer service, Delta receives a big fat F! The initial contact with a company is everything and if I was a person of authority within this organization, I’d perform a complete retraining on all front desk staff. In the future, I’ll ask my corporate office to book me on another airline."
"""Worst experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to San Diego. Worst experience ever. Just before boarding, they took my cabin luggage saying there was no more room in the aircraft. Arrived in San Diego and my luggage is missing. How can an airline be so unprofessional on an 1-hour flight? They ruined 1 day of vacation and nobody can explain what happened. Run away from Delta airlines."
"""I will never chose Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Bonaire to Baltimore via Atlanta. I was supposed to be rebooked on this flight due to an AA flight being extremely delayed because of weather. AA was extremely helpful and friendly while getting us re booked on a Delta flight since all other AA flights were sold out. Success! So we thought. Delta was too incompetent to figure out the new reservation, even after we gave them the new confirmation number and showed them the email we received from Delta conforming our new flight - once Delta figured out what was going on (they took too long) and then said the flight just closed and we were no longer allowed to check in. Now we had no flight home and had to start all over again. When asked to speak with a Delta supervisor, we were told that one was not available and because the guy was only a trainee he couldn’t help us. Thanks to AA they were able to help find us another flight. I will never chose Delta for a flight option ever. Their customer service is one of the worst I’ve seen!"
"""airline service is okay""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Shanghai via Detroit. The wifi onboard was good. The airline service is okay generally, but not for a team out for a robotics competition: we were in Houston for a robotics competition and checked our robot before the flight. However, the ground staff made us dissemble our robot, which caused significant damage. Also, I think Delta's fares are relatively high when compared to its competitors like, which may be a concern. Their service is much better than United though."
"""It’s such a joke""","✅ Trip Verified | Seoul to New York via Seattle. There is always a reason why they leave you sitting in the airplane minutes after it lands. This airline is horrible. My most recent experience yesterday (8/22/18) we sat on the runway for 30 mins and I missed my connection. Now we are sitting here again after landing finally in New York. This time there’s some excuse about something breaking down. It’s such a joke. Very frustrating. Not only are you sitting in a little baby airplane for hours all scrunched up but then you can’t even get off when you finally arrive. 15 mins sitting as I type. Unreal. I’ll probably miss my transfer home now as a result."
"""worst airline experiences""","✅ Trip Verified | New Orleans to New York. One of the worst airline experiences of my life with irresponsible, and horrible customer service. This was supposed to be a direct flight from MSY to NYC. It left several hours late due to a landing gear failure, yet they still flew the plane - but only to Atlanta! From there they would not let me take my checked bag off the plane, even though they were switching planes and I notified them I would be booking a ticket with another airline from ATL since they tardiness caused me to miss my flight to Ireland at JFK. I landed in Ireland 9 hours late, spent and extra $1300, did not get refunded on my Delta flight, and on top of that am still missing my bag 2 days later. Unreal."
"""Almost 2 hours delayed start""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Tampa. Almost 2 hours delayed start, which, in today's world, is plain and simple unacceptable. I understand that it was probably not their fault completely, but the airline should have ensured access to the runway before boarding the flight and make us sit inside the plane for so long without it starting."
"""last time ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Montreal. Honestly the worst experience ever. We had a flight from hspan to Detroit then to Montreal. The Japan Detroit was great people were amazing but once we got to Detroit everything went down. We asked if we can move our layover flight earlier as delays started to appear they said if it's not 90 min they can't or we have to pay 400 usd in total for a flight change. We decided its not worth it. So we took our original flight next morning which has been replayed since 5 am. Its been delayed with no explanation again and again. The staff at delays usa is completely rude. Do not answer questions i mean who is training them? Do they even get training? I am literally still sitting here waiting for a plane which is so stupid because I am only 1.4 hours away from Montreal. Horrible. 1st time ever using them and last time ever."
"""Exceptionally slow service""","✅ Trip Verified | Eugene to Las Vegas. Exceptionally slow service. I understand that computers can take time, but the folks working behind the counter were casually strolling from side to side and into back room at a pace that was painful to watch. High disregard for the long line of people waiting to check bags. Please improve the sense of urgency at Eugene."
"""I was impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | The plane, despite it being 14 years old, was in great condition. The plane was packed, however, I was assigned a seat next to the emergency exit so the legroom was amazing. The crew were friendly and we were served snacks and drinks. There was no IFE system on the back of seats, however, there was WiFi (free Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, otherwise paid) and I was able to check the flight status. This was the first time I flew in something smaller than an A320, and I was impressed!"
"""expectations were exceeded""","✅ Trip Verified | Milan to Cancun return via Atlanta in business and my expectations were exceeded. Excellent polite staff at MXP Airport very helpful and professional, once on board senior cabin attendants warm and grateful to us for flying with them. Sky priority is a good product, seats and food good quality. Lounges in ATL are huge full of people, drinks and food I think DL it's the best US airline choice and can compete with the Europeans. Delta mobile app so useful and efficient with the possibility to truck your luggage also. Wi-fi was working on all flights perfectly and for free."
"""Worst I've ever flown""","Not Verified | Orlando to Los Angeles. Checked in a minute before my time, got ""assigned seats"" in row 40. Called customer service to change my seats, because I was traveling with my 3 1/2 year old. I said I will pay whatever the price is for ""comfort"" seats, they said I don't even qualify to pick those seats. The ""roomy"" seats were by the exits and I can't sit there with a kid. Bottom line I was stuck by the bathrooms on a 5 hour flight with my son. We fly frequently and this was the First and last time we will fly with Delta. A I would rather pay way more than fly with Delta. Worst I've ever flown!"
"""super sweet staff""","✅ Trip Verified | Cincinnati to Calgary. I didn't realize my passport was expired until I was in the airport to check in, while my families' are still active, they left without me. I was in a great disappointment since we are traveling to Canada I couldn't leave without a passport. One of the ground crews showed her empathy and kindly lead me to the special help crews. They talked and came up with a plan, since it was early in the morning and we are close to Chicago (~8am), they tried to help me get to Chicago Passport Agency (closed at 3pm) and have my passport renewed on the same day. So that they booked me a ticket to Chicago and rebooked my trips for the next early morning leaving from Chicago all for free! Since I needed two 2""x 2"" pictures and form DS 82 before I go to the CPA, staff helped me to find a nearest place where I could get those documents, and she even walked me down to the ground transportation. It was a long day and lots of running, but I was so lucky everything worked so smoothly, I was at Calgary just about 12 hours later than our original arrival time. My trip wouldn't happen without the help of these staff. Delta has super sweet staff and fare price."
"""Never more frustrated""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Atlanta. Never more frustrated. Flight delayed and missed connection. No representatives to speak with only told the flight left and to go to a different gate when at gate and told to go to baggage claim because desk was closing. Flight could have waited less than 5 min for the late delta flight to get off as next flight was one gate down. Oh and we couldn't get off flight because a truck was blocking gate. No excuse for this any other business would be bankrupt."
"""Can't recommend this airline""","Not Verified | My recent flight from JFK New York to Sacramento via Atlanta was 24 hours from hell. Despite my efforts in trying to remain optimistic, experiencing disappointment after disappointment, I had to choice but to just be upset. I flew out of JFK on a rainy day, therefore all of the Delta flights were delayed. I found it curious that the online airline that experienced delayed take-offs was Delta that day, but what can you do? The delay would make me miss my second flight I need to get to my final destination. When I spoke to a Delta employee about re-navigating my flight, I was given very half-invested attention. From making jokes constantly with her fellow employee, to forgetting what she was searching for, she ended up booking me on my original flight in hopes we would make up time in the air. I just went with it, trusting a professional opinion over my own. Of course the flight was delayed even more and I missed my flight and the second option she put me on standby for. Delta accommodated me with a hotel and meal voucher. I the next available flight from Atlanta to Sacramento the next morning. Not anything you can do at this point. As inconvenient as this was, this is not the part of my Delta experience that really put me off. After finally arriving to Sacramento, I only an item that was at the top of one of my bags was missing and my other bag was missing altogether. When I finally received my second bag at home that night via their delivery service, the wheel was completely broken off and the side of my baggage had a big hole in it. Can't recommend this airline after receiving my belongings in such a state. Basically I received poor customer service, 12 hours added to my travel and over $300 worth of damage/lost items."
"""Worst flight experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Indianapolis via New York. Worst flight experience I have ever had. I have flown a lot for work and vacation. Delta Airlines cancelled my flight due to “weather conditions”, but the nothing supported that reason. Delta failed to plan for contingencies and left several individuals and families stranded at JFK without any accommodations or productive solutions for their customers. The staff were rude and displayed no compassion to the travelers. Bottom line, do not fly Delta Airlines."
"""had nothing but issues""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Portland via Seattle. I've had nothing but issues with Delta. I booked a trip to Vegas for a wedding. The flight was delayed to the point I was late for the wedding. There was absolutely no customer service. Every employee I talked to trying to get a different flight just blew me off. One actually told me I should have booked with another airline because all the Delta flights are late. She was correct. Every single flight has been delayed. Its cost me a total of over 8 hours of layover time. What a joke. Awful customer service and nothing but late flights. I would recommend any other company besides Delta."
"""flight is cancelled""","✅ Trip Verified | Me and my family were supposed to fly to Buffalo from LGA by Delta. The flight was originally scheduled at 11.50 am 13th Aug 2018. I got an SMS at 9.30 am saying the flight is cancelled due to bad weather. There were mild showers for 30 mins or so, but most other airlines were operating, even Delta had another flight 4 hrs later on the same day to same destination. They could have delayed the flight by 2-3 hrs, but they cancelled it and booked a flight for 14th morning. It will throw off all my subsequent plans (extended hotel stay in New York, plans in BUF and flight booked from BUF back to NYC). I tried booking some other airlines within 2-3 hrs, the prices of which were $600-700 for each ticket. It was a very uncomfortable and stressful experience."
"""Overall experience was good""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to San Francisco. This is the short domestic flight. The checked bag will be charged for 25USD for the first bag when checked in. My bag was 55 lbs which is a bit exceed the allowance. I asked the staff to repack my bag, removing something out and re-scale the weight. She blamed me and talked many words. She wanted me to pay the heavy-bag charge just because to complete everything quickly. Then I gave up and let her charge the fee. She completed printing the tag and receipt and said ""a hundred dollars"". I have just known the fee at that moment. She never informed the fee before. 100USD is about 80% of my ticket price. My friends checked-in at the counter beside. Staff advised them to re-pack. She was very polite and helpful. Poor me, wrong counter, changed the experience. On cabin experience, everything went very well. Thai cabin crew on board was very very nice. She was very helpful, respectful and service-minded. All other crews were also nice. Overall experience over the Delta domestic short flight was good except only one bad ground staff at the check-in counter."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to New York. This has been the worst flying experience. In fact, we never actually ended up flying and did not make it to our destination. We were originally booked to fly to NYC on August 4th and back on August 5th for a weekend trip, and that flight was delayed for 2 hours and then cancelled after a very short time, and I'm about 99% sure this was due to a mechanical issue. We rebooked for the next weekend on the same flights (August 11th-August 12th), and the gate agent was willing to upgrade us to first class. Sounds great, right? I guess it would've if that had actually worked out. That flight was delayed for 3 hours and then cancelled AGAIN. Now, this time, it was due to weather, which they can't control; however, this is the first time I've been cancelled due to weather. In the past, I've been delayed for a long time, but not cancelled. We rebooked on another flight, this was 3 hours later, and it gets delayed due to weather/late inbound flight, and once it finally makes it to the gate, we get ready to board, and then the gate agent announces that the flight was cancelled again literally just as the plane is about to board. Some airlines like to keep delaying the flight and are really hesitant to cancel, where as Delta just decides to give up and cancel the flights. We went back to the counter and asked to rebook and there was one agent there who was literally the opposite of helpful, and he kept asking us to wait a minute, and then stand back, and to give priority to the people on the Paris flight, and my dad had to call his attention by saying, ""Don't worry about us. We're just customers going to go to New York,"" and the one woman that was standing next to him gave another sarcastic remark, and then they walked away. We waited an hour and a half on the phone to ask if we could be reimbursed. They were willing to give us our money back. I've flown Delta many times without incident, but I have to say I was quite disappointed this time. I'm not saying I won't fly them again because I will, but this was an experience that really let me down. They are usually good to us, but this was an experience that I won't soon forget. My ratings for Value for money and Ground service are based on this trip. My ratings for Seat comfort and Cabin Staff service can't apply for this trip because we never actually made it into the air or even on the plane, so they are based on past experiences with Delta."
"""a terrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Austin to Seattle. Baggage handling was completely incompetent. I checked in online and printed my boarding pass, but it took 35 minutes in a huge long line simply to drop off my bag in Austin. After arriving in Seattle, it took one full hour after the flight reached the gate before I got my bag!! From what the staff told me, the bags were unloaded from the airplane but no one was there to deliver them to the baggage claim area. We were all standing around waiting for our bags and it took a very long time for the staff to figure out what happened. Finally I got my bag and was given a ticket for some bonus miles, but the agent did not tell me that I only had 3 days to claim them. I waited until I returned home a week later, and by then it was too late to get the miles. The flight was expensive and uncomfortable The 6:40 am departure time was too early. And wasting over 1.5 hours of my time on dropping off and collecting my suitcase was inexcusable. Overall a terrible experience with Delta and I will avoid flying with them in future."
"""never fly this airline again""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to New York. Absolutely terrible, they cancelled my flight less than 12 hours before I was supposed to leave via text. I had no other options to fly out of the same airport, so I had to switch to another airport almost an hour away. My return flight home was returning to the airport I had originally booked with and if I wanted to change that flight it would cost me more money since that flight was not cancelled. A whole bunch of phone calls and issues 3 hours later I had my new flight, but needed to now book a car to drive me since my car could be in Boston MA when I was flying back to Manchester NH. $150 later I had the ride, but the hassle of all this was not fun. I feel as though cancellation should happen much sooner and if one flight is cancelled, you should be able to change the return flight at no extra cost. I will never fly this airline again."
"""Our trip was ruined""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Amsterdam. Frequent fliers with Delta status for the past decade. Delays have certainly become more of an issue with them yet we have continued to remain loyal. Flew out of Atlanta to Amsterdam to cruise for 13 days. Arrived in AMS, no bags. No explanation of where our bags were. Filed our missing bags report with KLM baggage office. Made several phone calls every day trying to track down our missing luggage. Call after call, lie after lie. Total disregard and lack of follow through. After day 6 I really started to panic when my husband received an email from Delta saying that our bags were delivered to us and the file was closed. No joke. I started calling like a maniac at this point. KLM and Delta - all different stories. Our bags showed up on day 11 of our 13-day cruise. Our trip was ruined. I have never been so furious, frustrated, and frantic in my life. Shame on you, Delta. Losing a customers bag for so many days and not taking responsibility for it is inexcusable."
"""waste time sitting in an airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas Ft Worth to Detroit. Delayed flights all the time! Not just once. Lost baggage. If you are looking to waste time sitting in an airport then you will definitely want to fly Delta Air Lines."
"""They do not care""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Pittsburgh operated by Delta. A nightmare. After 21-hour flying from Asia to JFK with my little kids, a 7 year and a 2 year old, we supposed to have only 3 hours layover at JFK and a 2 hour flight to get home. The last flight was delayed totally 12 hours including 1 hour in plane. The nightmare was, they extended the delay every hour and then every 20 minutes and they changed the gate for almost every time. We had to stay in the terminal, moved every time they extended the delay and changed gate. Our kids could not take a rest after 21 hours flying from Asia. They slept while sitting on the ground, in the crowd, in front of the gate to wait. I talked to Delta reps, they said ""sorry"" and turned their back. I did not see that they cared or felt sorry. It is the word they use to avoid troubles. It was not only our flight. Delta's terminal was a mess with many flights canceled, delayed, changed gate. We used to have problems with Delta. If there was another choice, we did not travel with Delta. Value for money - No. Cost to fly with Delta is not low. Ground service - Delta attendants are robots. They do not care. Seat comfort - small, narrow. Cabin staff service - The only thing they can do is to bring you water. Conclusion: very high price for very low cost flight."
"""how not to do business""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Houston. Front seat at the gate employee: Based on delta/reservation representative: I had to direct my question to the Delta front seat at the gate: it was about seat re-assignment. The problem was that I was not able to even pass my question to him properly (the front seat employee gave me no time to ask and he -rudely- interrupted me and asked me to look at the blue screen). Of course I did look at the blue screen prior to asking him: but I didn’t get an answer from the board about my question He was a very poor communicator I was the only customer at his desk: not a busy day, but he showed me how “not to do business “"
"""experience was so terrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Delhi via Paris. The entire experience was so terrible that it still gives me nightmares. The itinary from Seattle to Paris was uneventful. The horror started when I landed in Paris for the connection to delhi. The flight was cancelled due to technical issues, and Delta rebooked me via Air France to Munich, and then via Lufthansa from Munich to Delhi. Nobody however thought of these 3 things when rebooking me. France needs a schengen transit visa when changing the airports. I of course did not have that. I was denied boarding to Munich due to this. I would need new boarding passes from Air France and Lufthansa. Since this was a rebooking, the PNR changed. Delta did not provide me with that, and I had to run back & forth between counters in CDG airport to find Air France counters to give me the boarding pass. There was an available flight from Paris to Mumbai, but Delta did not book me on that. I eventually reached via CDG-DXB-DEL. The DXB-DEL was via Emirates, which was a pleasure. The whole ordeal added 12 hours to my travel time. Delta did not agree to any refund / compensation (they shook off any responsibility for this)."
"""experience was terrible""","✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Seattle. Flight experience was terrible. The flight was delayed for more than 4.5 hours ( due to some cooling system issue with the aircraft ). This with an airline , which is supposedly in top 3 of US airlines. The customer service is a joke, only 1 person trying to answer questions of an entire flight. People missing their connections, and the response is a shoulder shrug. I also observed the ground staff to be rude, and unhelpful to elderly passengers. Delta does not care that when we reach to our destination at 1 am in the night, the passengers have to pay surcharge for Uber, and wont obviously compensate for it. Any snacks, and hot meals wont compensate for the terrible handling of the entire situation."
"""a wonderful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | This is the first long-haul flight from Haneda to Minneapolis–Saint Paul Airport. I sat at 51J next to two windows and the width of seat is large enough for me. The pilots did very well to inform the passengers and also reduce the effect of turbulence. There were one dinner after taking-off, one breakfast during flight, and one lunch before landing. These dishes were good and the snack was also great. I was impressive by the internet connection during the flight, even over the Pacific. That was a wonderful experience since I can keep connecting with my family, my friends, and others via the internet. For entertainment, there were many latest films and videos, especially I liked the documentary videos. Summary, even though I just flew in economy class, this was a wonderful experience."
"""entire experience was terrible""","Not Verified | Booked to fly Delta from Orlando to Pittsburgh. The entire experience was terrible. The flight was cancelled without notice when we reached our layover in Boston. We had to sleep in the airport and wait until the morning just to get put on standby. We kept getting pushed aside as though we hadn't paid the same or equivalent amount as fellow passengers. Now we have to wait until Sunday because this for lack of a better word terrible airline did nothing to accommodate us for the massive inconvenience that occurred."
"""will now miss my connection""","✅ Trip Verified | Sitting on the runway for 45 minutes, captain announced a short delay when everyone was loaded due to a storm cell. I will now miss my connection in Detroit. I have flown with Delta for several years and have seen this happen too many times. There is nothing worse than sitting on the runway in the plane. It's already an uncomfortable experience and I could be making arrangements for getting home in the airport but I'm stuck on this plane in the middle of a storm!"
"""customer service is horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to New York JFK. The customer service is horrible. Cancelled my 10pm flight so we rushed to the airport for a delayed 11:30 flight now taking off at 3:30 only to find out it was delayed till 4, then 6, then 7, then 8 and they cancelled it completely -because they didn’t have a flight crew! How in the world does an airline not have a crew to fly a plane scheduled months in advance? Why is there no back up in place. Customer service is a joke, spoke to a supervisor who was condescending and absolutely useless, not at all sympathetic or customer service oriented. Will not be flying Delta again, my sisters missing her best friends bachelorette and I now get to spend a whole day flying with stops in order to get home to my 8 year old child."
"""almost missed our flight.""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Minneapolis. Everything was fine except that we almost missed our flight. The gate was changed without our knowledge and when we happened to see our flight information at a different gate, the gate agents were absolutely rude They said they had announced the gate change. We had been there for 2 hours and never heard a gate change announcement. Also, the guy at the original gate never announced anything. And the other agents couldnt be heard or understood. At least 6 seats were empty as well so I'm pretty sure others missed the gate change too."
"""worst airline for families""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Sacramento. They are the absolute worst airline for families. They sat every single person separate in my family of five including my 3 year old and 5 year old girls. My girls were crying because they were sitting away from us. Luckily some people moved and my husband sat next to them but it’s the airlines policy to not get involved. I asked several ticketing counters to correct and and they overbooked the flight and kept passing us off to the next person even though we arrive 2.5 hours in advance. Won’t be getting my $2000 anymore for family trips."
"""the seats were so close""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Amsterdam. Our flight was delayed from 5.30 to 6.20 PM, therefor we miss our luggage when arriving in Copenhagen. In the flight the seats were so close to each other - not enough space for the feet (I am 180cm tall). The crew looks very stressed - forget about smile on your journey - all the menu was sold out except from from some pasta - no choice. My boys slept, therefore they didn't get anything to eat. I can keep on, but I don't think nobody deserve to hear that much garbage."
"""wide seats and adequate pitch""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Shanghai. Great flight on route just re-established by DL. Oldish 777, but wide seats and adequate pitch. IFE is dated, but seat room and genial service inflight make up for it. Delta says they are trying to make pax comfortable while other US carriers (hint AA) are only about profit. I agree based on 2 trans Pacific flights last week, one on each carrier."
"""a very personal touch""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Las Vegas return. Took my son to Las Vegas for his 21st birthday, actually leaving on his birthday. When the FA's made the rounds for drinks I made it a point to tell them make sure you check his ID. When they discovered he turned 21 on that day they served him. Then they came back later with a bag of snacks with a hand written card wishing him a happy birthday. The same thing happened on the return flight. I thought it was a very personal touch and made him feel special. Both flights were pleasant, the aircraft clean and we even arrived a little early on both flights. I would advise anyone to fly Delta as the go the extra mile. The only downside is that my son's suitcase was severely damaged when we retrieved it in Detroit. I filed a claim and am waiting to see what happens now."
"""Delta needs to catch up""","✅ Trip Verified | Avoid taking the Flat Bed Delta One from Minneapolis to London. Delta still uses older 767-300ER on this route and these flat beds are less comfortable than the new one on Delta's 777 (if you seek to fly Delta). That said, the service was good and the food was good but not competitive with the better airlines in business class. After using the route and Delta, well, next flight I will seek a better airline when booking a first class flat bed. Delta needs to catch up."
"""Worst experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo Haneda to Los Angeles. First of all this flight was delayed at least 4 times which caused our connection to get totally messed up many times. Because it left so late in the evening, we ate before boarding. Then within 1 hour of boarding they served dinner at 1am, which we had already eaten dinner, so we skipped it. Then we only got food again breakfast just before landing at LAX. Then it took over an hour to get through customs and then another 2 hours on top of that to get our luggage. Then we had to totally check back into the airport because we missed our flight and they made us leave. So now it's almost 8:40 and back through security, baggage and about to board connection and our tickets were invalidated and my wife's TSA wasn't applied to her ticket or app so the added pain there and landed in PHX after 11pm and all is closed in the Delta terminal. So didn't get any real food again until we left the airport after midnight which options are very limited. So that's from 9pm Tokyo time (our 5am) till 11pm to get any real food beside a breakfast snack. Worst experience I've ever had on Delta and has ruined us for all future air travel on Delta!"
"""Terrible accountability""","✅ Trip Verified | La Guardia to Pittsburgh. Terrible accountability. Delayed over 2 hours on way to Savanah. Now delayed 3+ hours on return. Maintenance issue supposedly. Delta reps offer no explanation or assistance when traveling with 3 small kids. As I sit here writing this, delayed once again"
"""they just cancelled our flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Shannon to Las Vegas via New York. We get on the flight in JFK and hit bad weather. Aviation rules say they let us off after 3 hours of sitting on the tarmac. It took 4 hours. There were a lot of us traveling and my brothers San Diego flight took off within minutes of them unloading our plane. The captain said the crew on our plane would time out in the air to Las Vegas so they just cancelled our flight. My in laws on a flight to Phoenix were also brought back to the terminal because their captain timed out. The best delta could do was get us home by midnight the next night via a ton of transfers but couldn’t leave jfk until 2 the next afternoon as all flights were sold out. Then I find a San Diego flight that was supposed to leave at 7:25 but it’s delayed until 12:40 so we get that flight because it’s close enough. The soonest they can get us out of San Diego is 5 pm. I’m on the phone with delta and the lady talks to me for over 20 minutes. Most of the time on hold. I walked to the gate and asked the ticket agent about getting on the flight he gets us passes before this lady can get me off hold. Not sure what she could have possibly been doing. I decided to purchase tickets on southwest because now I’m getting home on Saturday and I leave again on Tuesday. We are returning from a 3 week trip and just want to be home. I’m also flying with children. We finally get on the San Diego flight but there’s no pilot so we don’t leave until 1:40 am. But the icing on the cake is that we are given comfort plus seats and I ask for blankets and pillows when we sit down. The flight attendant says she will check when she gets a second—she was a little frantic over whether a pilot was actually coming. No one helps me so I try to sleep. Get up to use the bathroom and see the entire coach class with blankets and pillows. When I ask again, they are all out. The in laws were loaded on a plane to Atlanta, driven out to the taxi way and then brought back to the gate because the pilot timed out. Why even put the people on the plane?? They can cry weather all they want but the flight I got on had their entire crew time out so they pulled another crew and put them on this flight so we could take off. It’s interesting how forth coming these people are with their information. This crew could have been given to the vegas flight. I can’t see how it’s cost effective to strand 100’s of people. I’m paying and extra $800 to get home because delta can’t get their act together. And then I can’t get a blanket?"
"""attendants were super nice""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Austin. I was travelling alone for the first time ever, and as someone with high anxiety this was a major deal. The flight attendants were super nice. When i casually mentioned it was my first time alone and i had already gotten lost in the airport, they made sure i was okay and one gave me one of those pins with wings! I know theyre meant for little kids, but it means a lot to me and i wish i had gotten her name to properly thank her."
"""denied me a seat""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Atlanta. Delta delayed my fight and denied me a seat on an earlier flight with an available empty seat. I was at the gate 45 minutes before takeoff, had my ID out, and boarding pass in hand. When they asked if I had checked a bag, I foolishly answered “yes.” The supervisor used that as the reason for denying me a seat, citing it would be a “security” issue. So I guess every time we fly on a Delta flight with a bag belonging to someone who missed her connection, we are risking our security?? Does it take Delta over 45 minutes to locate and transfer a checked bag?? Is an ontime departure of a plane with empty seats more important than customer service? I wonder how Southwest and Jet Blue handle this scenario — based on customer reviews, I am most certain it is not like Delta does!"
"""Delta is incompetent""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Los Angeles. Horrible experience. I purchased two round trip tickets to have my kids come visit me. I paid the fee to have them accompanied by a Delta employee. At the time I purchased the tickets I gave both parents information. The flight was changed at the last minute and was not even notified. When I took my kids the the airport for the return flight they didn't have My Ex's info so I had to give it to them again. When my kids arrived they didn't let her through security because they said I didn't pay the fee to have them accompanied by Delta employee. Which I did. I cost me an extra $300. So they were going to have to walk by themselves down to baggage claim. Something they have never done before. Complete lack of organization. When I got to the ticketing counter the ticketing agent didn't even know how to activate the tracker arm bracelets. Delta is incompetent."
"""Baggage charges not posted""","✅ Trip Verified | Duluth to Austin. All of Delta Baggage charges are not posted on their website and excessive. After returning from a family fishing trip that had the first leg canceled. On the return we flew out of Duluth they charged me $200 or $2/pound for fish. My brother who was traveling on United Flight 5167 the same day paid nothing for the same amount of fish in his cooler. They told me they would respond to my complaint 45 days later. They called me on the 25 day and told me they did not know where the excessive freight charges were posted on there web site and the would not reduce my charges to even be competitive with United Airlines. I guess I will fly United next time."
"""Completely horrendous""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Buenos Aires. Completely horrendous. Delayed on first leg only to be more delayed on longer route. Not only delayed for an hour and half a gate but tv screen in op. Flagged down two stewardess who sighed when I asked about screen. Mobile to Atlanta flight one hour behind with a stewardess that shouted rudely over the mic for a passenger to sit down, not use the restroom. We had been sitting in the plane for over 45 minutes. Now trying to leave Atlanta. Same rude attendants, broken in flight display and stewardesses who could care less. Been thru this many times with Delta and will drive to another departure city so I don’t spend my money with this crew. Terrible!"
"""had the worst experience""","✅ Trip Verified | We have had the worst experience flying with delta. We got off of our cruise ship at 9am on 7/20/18 and were required to take the shuttle to the airport where I waited with my mother, my 14 year old son and his 14 year old friend. After waiting all day for our 6:40pm flight we were informed it was delayed over four hours and we would miss our layover flight from Atlanta to Dayton because of it. So they gave us standby tickets for an earlier flight (from Orlando to Atlanta) that was already overbooked; when I asked about getting a hotel room at the Orlando airport for the night and just traveling in the morning I was told they wouldn’t cover any of the costs and that we needed to take our original flight to Atlanta if we couldn’t get on any earlier flights and for the second time we were put on standby for yet another overbooked flight (they offered $600 to people to give up seats) because they were already overbooked. They went ahead and changed our missed flight from Atlanta to Dayton to the following morning at 8:10am so we were supposed to be all set for when we finally arrived in Atlanta. Finally we boarded our very delayed flight to Atlanta after being at the airport for over 13 hours when we arrived in Atlanta at 1am there was no one to help us find a hotel or somewhere to sleep so I went to the help phone to ask them. The delta help lady on the phone informed me we weren’t even secheduled for any flights from Atlanta to Dayton!!!!! She went ahead and set the flight up for us (she was the only helpful person; she also informed me that the closets place to stay was not within walking distance) so we had to nap in chairs at Atlanta airport until our 8:10am flight. Then our 8:10 flight got delayed another two and a half hours so here we sit we have been at the airport for over 24 hours with absolutely no accommodations (besides one nice worker NOT with Delta that brought us blankets and snacks at 2am because everything was closed and she was off of work for the night). This mornings flight is said to be delayed due to weather however when I tracked the plane it is still at its last destination where the weather is clear....we do have rain in Atlanta however all the other planes are arriving and departing just fine! Delta is a joke and I will discourage everyone I know from using this horrible airline!"
"""will not fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Tampa. Recently I decided to start using Delta Airlines. It was a fairly last minute trip so I scheduled a flight from Detroit to Tampa and paid around $450. I scheduled the 8:20 PM because I didn't know what time I would be done with work. It turned out my assignment ended early so I got to the airport at 1PM to try to get on a 3:30PM flight. At first I was informed there would be a $75 fee to change to the earlier flight which was fine with me and well worth it. Then after looking up my fare the Delta employee told me that I could not change the flight because I had an economy fare. The only option was to buy a new ticket for close to $500 on the 3:30 flight. I asked if I could go standby they said no. I asked if there was anything I could do to get on the earlier flight short of paying another full fare. They said ""sorry but you purchasd the cheap fare and Delta tries to make as much as they can."" So the 3:30 flight was delayed until 4:45. I hung around hoping I could get on the flight. I tried again and Delta said that if the 8:20 is delayed then they would allow me to get on the earlier flight. I asked them to check and they said it was not delayed - sorry. Once everyone boarded the earlier flight I tried again and they said they could not put me on the flight even though there was plenty of extra seats. The later flight is not delayed and that is the only way they would allow it. The flight left. Not 10 minutes goes by and I get an email saying the 8:20 is delayed. Delta Airlines does not care about accommodating its passengers. They could have put me on that earlier flight and made an extra $75 but they chose to be greedy and make me sit in the airport for another 4 hours. My flight has been delayed to 8:45 and I am betting it will be later than that. Fly Southwest - they are the best when it comes to making changes to your flight. They are very accommodating easy to deal with and generally care about their passengers. I will not fly Delta again."
"""young men who were so helpful""","Not Verified | Because of a bad knee, I require a wheelchair when changing planes. On my recent trip from Peoria, IL to Bozeman, MT, along with my two adult daughters and a niece, the young man pushing my wheelchair at the Minneapolis airport was very helpful in getting us to the departure gate on time. On our return trip, the plane was very late leaving Bozeman for Minneapolis. We only had 10 minutes from deplaning time to our departure to Peoria. That young man, pushing my wheelchair, was also very helpful. When we exited the tram from Section D to Section A, we heard our names called for the flight. We were at A 1 and going to A 13. My 53 year old daughter said, should I run and the young man said Yes. She started running and then my 61 year old daughter started running and passed her sister. They were waiting for our group when she arrived at the departure gate because they could see the ""girls"" running toward them. I'm sorry I did not get the names of those two young men who were so helpful to get us from one plane to another. Also thankful that the gate agent saw the girls running toward then and held the plane. Also wish I had a video of the event."
"""will not fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew Delta from Accra, Ghana to Boston transiting in France. The check in process in Accra delayed for about 3 hours due to a system failure so essentially our baggage didn't make it to Boston. Due to the system failure, Delta couldn't pull up my records which it later turned out, they had wrongfully assigned my baggage to another person. Basically it took Delta 3 weeks to find and deliver my bags. To add insult to injury, Delta decided to compensate me with $100, and even that, it's a voucher I have to use towards my next ticket purchase with Delta. Such an appalling gesture from Delta after this grueling ordeal; from terrible experience in their sister Air France flight to wasting my time for 3 weeks. I will not fly Delta again."
"""Worst airline ever""","Not Verified | Hong Kong to Seattle. Do not fly Delta. I have traveled extensively in my 65 years and only fly Delta when I have no other choice. I bought my ticket asked for a window seat, checked in about 24 hours prior to departure, got to the airport three hours early and guess what, got a middle seat for a 14 hour trip on a full plane. Argued my point with the counter clerk and all I got was you can fly standby next flight. Worst airline ever!"
"""lack of compassion""","✅ Trip Verified | My 16 year old daughter was flying solo for the first time. Her mom booked through an agency. We were never made aware of a $150 unaccompanied minor fee. Her flight was cancelled due to poor weather. I get that. It happens but the customer service that followed is unacceptable. Gate agent told my 16 year old daughter that since the fee was not paid there was nothing she could do. My wife had to speak to gate agent on speaker phone to even get her to do basic customer service. The lack of compassion this gate agent showed is appalling. Regardless of any additional fees paid or not the safety of a minor should have been Delta Airlines main priority. Leaving a minor stranded without rectifying the issue is unacceptable. It should not have taken a call from an adult to fix. She knows her job she chose to be lazy and do the bare minimum or actually even less than that. With all the bad press Delta has been receiving you would think that retraining your agents would be a priority. Shame on you Delta Airlines for leaving a 16 year old kid crying hysterically and doing nothing to solve the problem. Your lack of compassion and human decency is noted."
"""crews are really nice""","Not Verified | Flight was very good, we came to Atlanta Hartsfield Airport 40 minutes early and that was a smooth landing. Also, on the cabin is kind of hot but it is okay. The crews are really nice and friendly, ground services is nice too. They push back early than the departure time."
"""flights were canceled""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Abuja via Paris. I initially got an email saying It’s time to check in. Within a few mins, I got another email stating that my flights were canceled. After being on hold for over an hour with Air France, they finally changed me to a different flight that actually got me to my destination earlier than before, which I thought was impressive. With my return flight, I got a email at 3am that my flight for that evening was canceled again! I called once again, and surprisingly, the wait time wasn’t nearly as long as the the one before. My flight was moved to Lufthansa. On arrival to the airport I could not even check my bags in for the flight. I’ve checked in online, got my seat and everything else - my seat was given to another person. I decided to have nothing to do with both Delta and Air France and requested for my money back. I’ve booked a return flight with another airline."
"""past trip was horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Los Angeles. Our Delta experiences have always been lackluster but these past 2 trips have been horrible. We consider ourselves to be consistent flyers of Delta (4 flights a year) and seem to be considered part of the “lower class” in their terms. Being forced to fly in zone 4 everytime has began to reveal the garbage service of Delta. Using zone 4 we NEVER get to bring out bags on board and always have them checked in. Zone 4 also NEVER gets to choose where we sit and get our entire family split and stick in the middle seat all through the plane. Our trip from Washington DC to Detroit was a short bearable trip as it was an hour but this past trip was horrible as having my children with randoms spread across the plane is a horrible way to treat a family. Upon calling to fix our seating the situation got worse, the computer system told us they would call us back in 3 hours . This is ridiculous customer service. They finally called back and told us we could switch with other passengers but NO ONE wants to switch seats to sit in the middle and we were stuck in our horrible seats. This is how Delta treats it’s frequent flyers. Don’t bother trying to be loyal to them. They will never be loyal back to you!"
"""never had a bad experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh to Denver. I have never had a bad experience with Delta--the staff always go above and beyond to help any and every way they can and is by far my favorite airline to fly, and I've flown pretty much every one. Definitely worth the price!"
"""leg space was sufficient""","✅ Trip Verified | Excellent evening/overnight flight with on time push back and arrival. The seating in economy class was in a 2-4-2 configuration and I had an aisle seat in the two seat block. The leg space was sufficient. A personal IFE provided opportunities to view movies and tv shows, listen to music, and track the flight. Controls were easy to use. Earphones were provided. Selection was on the small side but was sufficient. A menu flier was provided - I chose a vegetarian pasta dish, it came with the usual accompaniments of salad, bread, and dessert. Beer and wine were complimentary. A light morning pre-arrival snack was served. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Luggage space overhead was ample. A sleep mask, pillow, and blanket came with the seat. The aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth. At check in at JFK's Delta terminal 4, I printed out my boarding pass from a machine and did not have to interact with an agent at a desk. The organization of boarding was more or less smooth with gate agents making announcements and screens displaying boarding status. There was no anxiety or stress at the gate. Nothing to complain about. Delta did its job - taking a customer to his destination on time and in comfort. I have been flying them more often now and find that they are offering a quality product."
"""most uncomfortable flight""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Salt Lake. Paid for the $80.00 upgrade for better seating to get into the worst possible seat. Leg room was great, row 13E next to attendants jump seat was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on."
"""spread us out across the plane""","✅ Trip Verified | Jacksonville to Detroit. Absolutely horrible, we were traveling as a family and we booked our flight together. When we got to the gate they decided we were no longer allowed to travel as a family and changed our seats to spread us out across the plane. We had 2 kids with us 1 and 5. When I asked about having us put back together they said there was nothing they could do. I will never fly Delta again."
"""Horrible experience""","Not Verified | San Diego to Vancouver. Horrible experience. The flight had a maintenance issue, which in itself is completely understandable and that I was ok with. Our flight was from San Diego @ 5:25 pm with a layover in LA for 1.5 hours to Vancouver. We were told the flight had been delayed for 10 mins. Come back the flight is delayed for another 10 mins. Come back again and the lady said if it is anywhere past 6:20 we have to come to the front to change our flights as we would miss our connecting. Again totally fine, I am in a line up with one person in front of me awaiting the new update (currently states 6:20 departure) - flights delayed until 8:45pm - again totally fine. Then things start going south. The line was told if we wanted faster service to take a red card and call the number to change flights so I take a card and step out of line as I had to meet my boyfriend to let him know what was happening. I call the airline and there isn't a single flight that night until the next day. Ok that sucks but fine... we both have to book off work the next day now and so I asked politely if there was anything that they could do to make the situation better (aka seat upgrade). Nope notta. Fine. Well can I continue booking my hotel then as I would hope you cover that. Sorry mam, but you have to go to the ladies at the gate to book a room - so now I have to go back to the same line I was encouraged to step out, again 1 person in front of me before. 1 and 1/2 hours later (4 hours since arriving at the airport) finally get to the front- again. I explain to the same lady who told me to step out of the line what happened and again politely asked for anything to make the situation better - again nothing. Standard hotel room and food vouchers which are only good at the airport which we cant use for the meal we already ate while waiting for the delays. Then on our first flight they didn't seat us together and on the second connecting flight (2.5 hours) there were no TV's . This was pretty ridiculous there was zero customer service in handling the situation. We had to take another vacation day which we couldn't even take advantage of because anything worth going to in San Diego takes a full day. At the end of all of it they couldn't at least put us in Premium economy or give us credit we could use for something outside of spending more time at the airport or upgrade our room. I strongly suggest not taking this airline. Cancellations don't happen often but I would rather be stuck with an airline that cares about their customer experience rather than one which is just trying to fill seats. (San Diego restaurants however happily covered each of us for drinks so props to those guys for knowing something about customer service.)"
"""customer service was atrocious""","✅ Trip Verified | Newark to Atlanta. Delayed in airline forced us to miss connection. This connection was last flight of night so we had to leave the next morning at 9:45am. We had to spend the night at a hotel gave us a small voucher for. The rooms were full when we arrived, as were the next two hotels rooms. Delta gave no other accommodation, customer service was atrocious and deplorable at best. On our return flight their was no air and was super hot. We are still currently in the airport now waiting for a delayed flight. We will never fly Delta again, and they will not see a single cent from me or my family again. On a side note customer service in ATL was texting while assisting us."
"""feels like a cheap airline""","✅ Trip Verified | San Juan to New York. Feels like a cheap airline. Had to pay for checked-in luggage (which never happened to us on any, not a cheap airline and made for an unpleasurable experience) and fact that there was no free food on the plane. Poor choice of beverages and small restroom. Luckily seats were comfortable and there was lots of legroom. Multimedia worked great and there was free wi-fi for texting via messenger and whatsapp during the whole flight. Plane was very clean and modern."
""" pretty good experience""","✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to San Francisco. I had a pretty good experience with Delta! I flew JFK to SFO and my experience was pretty seamless. Great IFE and probably the best food I had on a domestic flight, I was actually impressed by the quality of it. Will definitely fly again."
"""Overall nice experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Las Vegas, around a 2.5 hour morning flight on board B737-800 not very new aircraft but sufficient and clean. Was upgraded to premium economy upon check in appreciated the extra leg room however don’t like the middle seats. Crew were very friendly and smiling. Meals is only a beverage (water in my case ) and a pack of peanuts. Overall nice experience and will use them again for my domestic flights"
"""delayed or cancelled""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Jacksonville. Our flights have been delayed or cancelled for 2 straight days and no offer to help us with our bags, a place to sleep, or any accommodations. Traveling with small children and the customer service in Atlanta couldn’t have been worse. I will never fly this airline again!"
"""just avoid them from now on""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to San Jose via Seattle. In several years of traveling, I have yet to have a problem free encounter with delta airlines. This most recent trip has had two flight delays, one that caused us to have to take a shuttle to another airport to get a different flight so we wouldn’t miss our connection and the other over 2 hours delayed. They ran out of meals on our 10 hour flight from Amsterdam to Seattle, so my family was left with the snacks that we left over. They tagged our luggage improperly, but luckily I was paying attention and caught the mistake before they sent all of our bags. They did send one down the belt with the wrong tag on it and couldn’t figure out which bag it was, but we managed to get that fixed just in time to run to our plane, even though we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart. I’ve traveled all over the world, and I’m sad to say that airlines from third world countries seem to operate more professionally and efficiently than delta. I tried to give them this one last chance, but I think I’ll just avoid them from now on."
"""soothing neo soul music""","✅ Trip Verified | I caught flight 454 from New York to Los Angeles seated in the main cabin returning from vacation, Upon entering the plane I had a headache and I heard this nice soothing what sounded to be like neo soul music playing, it also played as we exited the plane, It was so nice to hear that type of music playing because most airlines play elevator music. So I just want to give Delta flight attendants a high five, whoever had that music playing thank you. I dont usually fly Delta but I may in the future return."
"""was the worst flight""","Not Verified | This was the worst flight I have ever been on. The flight attendants were rude and disrespectful. I was having an anxiety attack and went to use the restroom as soon as the plane was in the gate, but I was unaware that the seatbelt sign was still on. If anyone has ever had an anxiety attack, you feel detached from your surroundings and it can be easy to make a mistake like getting up to go to the restroom 3 minutes prior to receiving permission. When I got to the restroom, one flight attendant told me to sit down, and as soon as she said that an announcement came on so I paused to listen. While I was trying to listen, both flight attendants began yelling at me to sit down so I could not hear the announcement and I was already shaking from my anxiety attack. I went to sit down, the seatbelt sign went off, and I walked back to the restroom. I was so nervous that the flight attendants would yell at me again that I waited for them to tell me it was okay to use the restroom. One of the flight attendants looked at me, angrily reached in front of me and yelled ""PUSH"" to show me how to open the door as if I were completely incompetent. I didn't say anything and went to the restroom, but while I was in there I could hear the two flight attendants talking about me. Overall, this experience was terrible, and the lack of humanity in Delta airplanes shocks me."
"""at the airport all day""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Los Angeles. Terrible experience. Only fly Delta as a last resort. My sister was at the airport all day. Initial plane with mechanical problems. Waited several hours for another plane, which came from Madrid. Finally got on that plane, sat on tarmac for 2 hours, and returned to gate for mechanical problems after hearing horrible noise on replacement plane. So two planes in one day with mechanical problems. Then they had to get another crew. So if two out of two planes have mechanical problems, this is airline to avoid at all cost. Who knows what type of old planes with tons of mechanical problems they are using. Oh, and by the way, none of the electric outlets worked on second plane."
"""consistently good service""","✅ Trip Verified | Service is perfect from online ticket purchase to returning home. Flying DL is easy and uneventful. Personnel are courteous, kind and professional, consistently good service. I love the DL App it’s easy, fewer keystrokes, online checkin email reminder takes less than a minute with no need to email it’s right in the app. It has become my new favorite airline."
"""Customer service is garbage""","✅ Trip Verified | This is definitely my last flight with Delta Air Lines. Customer service is garbage, takes hours to speak to someone and is a pain in the ass to make any adjustments to your flight. Upgraded to what I thought was Delta One (lie flat) instead got the single most uncomfortable first class seat I’ve ever sat in. It’s a bit wider than a normal seat but hard as a rock. Don’t pay premium prices for what has turned into a budget airline."
"""never fly with Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | My mom had back surgery about a month ago. She had a connecting flight from Vegas to Austin in Salt Lake City. Her flight from Vegas was late and she missed her connecting flight to Austin. She had to sleep on the airport floor which is obviously very painful for someone who had lower lumbar surgery a month ago, and is handicap. They could not get her a hotel, so they offered her was $90 in food vouchers. What is that, two meals at an airport? She had to buy her own blanket and pillow. Was not offered a mat. I am appalled by this treatment. I have had nothing but bad experiences with Delta. I will never fly with Delta again."
"""Cabin staff were friendly""","✅ Trip Verified | Very good experience on the flight from Hong Kong to Seattle. The lavatories on the right hand side were all closed due to pump problems. The seats were comfortable, food was good. They served dim sum for breakfasts, which was delicious. The flight entertainment option was good. Free wifi for texting, how cool! Cabin staff were friendly and always helpful. The gate agent was sympathetic to my long transit in Salt Lake City, i was given a meal voucher. The only thing is they change the flight time to create the long transit that I had to endure at the first place. Sadly the route from Hong Kong to Seattle will be axed, I feel sorry that this route has to be dropped. The flight was always full according to the ground agent, why drop the route?"
"""trip was entertaining""","✅ Trip Verified | St Louis to Miami. This is my first experience traveling by aircraft. I really enjoyed it. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I liked how the pilot kept us informed throughout the flight. Overall, the trip was entertaining, easy to get instructions to the right place, and relaxing. Thank you"
"""Extremely inconvenient""","Not Verified | Flew Atlanta to Tampa with Delta Air Lines. Makes me check bag when there is plenty of overhead space. Wasn't given reason for why. The overhead bin in my row itself had enough space for two extra bags. Extremely inconvenient in terms of time of arrival and needing to wait after just to wait for a bag that could fit right with me."
"""horrible customer service""","Not Verified | After booking a flight from Phoenix to Atlanta as a family of four, I was unable to select seats. I called the customer service line with the reservation (confirmation) number in order to be seated as a family. I was instructed that I must pay an additional cost ($76 per ticket) to have seats together. I paid the cost but the day we were to fly out my family was separated. I went to customer service and was told there was a change in aircraft. There were still 38 rows - why were we separated! I choose the back all the time because I have a 4 and 5 year old. At the counter, the attendant said ""not my problem"" - horrible customer service and at this rate this will be my last Delta flight. I paid extra to sit together and was told it's not their problem. Screw you Delta! You just lost service from a family who flies every other month!"
"""really went above for me""","✅ Trip Verified | Burlington to Atlanta. I was feeling pretty sick on this flight. I asked a stewardess for a ginger ale in the very beginning and she also brought me a bag and napkins. The three stewardesses on this flight were phenomenal. They checked in on me. They brought me some water and food. I couldn’t eat the free food due to my upset stomach so they found some food better for me. They really went above for me and it helped get me through my two hour flight!"
"""staff at check-in unfriendly""","✅ Trip Verified | Boise to Washington via Minneapolis. Seat choice not possible, staff at check-in unfriendly. Tried to choose my seat while online check-in, wasn’t possible. Was the first person at the gate but staff didn’t allow me to choose my seat and on top very unfriendly at Minnesota Airport. Not going to fly with this airline again until they change that."
"""one of the best flights""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Boston. This was one of the best flights I have been on! All the staff were caring and considerate. Delta has recently upgraded their A319 aircraft, there are larger overhead bins so the plane holds more carry ons. The plane also features Inflight entertainment screens. Delta’s new selection of snacks are great."
"""easiest and most pleasant""","✅ Trip Verified | Dublin to Cancun via New York. Very impressed with this airline. Have travelled a lot and used many airlines but Delta was by far the easiest and most pleasant. Staff were extremely helpful efficient and apologetic at any delays. Made the journey so easy and hassle free. Many thanks"
"""We are ever so thankful""","Not Verified | Flew to Aruba last month with no issues. Was scheduled to fly to Nebraska today (June 2018) from Ford Airport in Grand Rapids, MI, with a connecting flight in Minneapolis. Wanted to give credit and thanks to the great Customer Service Representative who helped us. Our flight to Minneapolis was very delayed, which meant we were going to miss our connecting flight in Minneapolis going to Omaha. This staff member checked every other possible flight options and everything was booked. She graciously checked on refunding our flight money, which was granted. We are ever so thankful in her turning a bad situation into a more positive one. We drove to Omaha, but have always had great service through Delta Airlines, and won't hesitate to keep flying through them!!"
"""sleeping in the airport""","✅ Trip Verified | My flight was supposed to be in Atlanta for an hour layover! We were scheduled to leave Atlanta at 10:30pm and be in Fort Lauderdale at 12:30am. I cannot believe we are basically sleeping in the airport after I paid for a hotel room. The staff at this Atlanta Airport are rude."
"""never book with Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Ft. Lauderdale. Delayed flight 3 times. Was supposed to leave at 10:30pm. Flight got delayed to 1:15am. Then flight got delayed to 2:20. Flight got delayed again until 3:20. Told us that it’s not guaranteed. At this point we are the only people in the airport here with the night workers and construction workers. You have people sleep on the floors and sleep anywhere they can. This is very inconvenient! We had a room booked and we are still currently stuck at the airport uncomfortable! I will never book with Delta again! Very unprofessional. So upset that we have been in the airport for five hours already!"
"""Save money and fly economy""","Not Verified | I wanted to alert fellow fliers that Delta Comfort Plus is really a scam, at least on this flight from New York to Barcelona. This is not premium economy at all. All it is seats with 3 inches more pitch. You get the same long boarding line as economy, same cabin, same seats, same meals, everything the same except a little more legroom. On top of that, a boarding system that was laughable and bad food (I mean inedible). This, for an extra $1000 per person, was insane. On the other hand, flight crew on both flights were excellent, as was the selection of movies on the in flight entertainment system. Save money and fly economy."
"""disrespect to customer""","Not Verified | This flight was delayed by one hour or so, which made me miss subsequent flights Delta 0121 (MSP to HND) and China Eastern 0540 (HND to PVG). This delay caused me to change my subsequent flight to next day which caused a penalty of $1,187.90 that I had to pay to China Eastern. Also, when Delta booked me for the next day flight, they told me that my single piece of luggage will be in the same flight as me and that I should not be worried about it. Next day I came early to the airport and wanted to double check that my luggage is on-boarded with me in the same flight, to my surprise, I figured out that my piece of luggage was actually sent to Chicago and no one can explain why? I spent an hour with luggage service, at the end they told me that we are forwarding it to Shanghai and that it will be in Shanghai 8 hours before me, so, I was OK to just go to luggage service to pick it up once there. When I reached Shanghai, the luggage service could not even track it, China Eastern had no clue where it is. Next day I spend couple hours on the phone to try to figure out when can I receive my luggage but didnt get anything. I called then Delta luggage service, they told me that my luggage is still in Chicago and it is planned to go to HND next day then to PVG. After calling 2 to 3 times a day, finally I received my luggage 4 days since my original flight. I was on a business trip and my stop at Shanghai was primary for meetings scheduled for Saturday April 28th, due to delay, I missed these meeting and my stop at Shanghai become worthless. I couldnt make up for these meetings since Monday and Tuesday was a Holiday in China and I had to continue my trip to my next stop in Wuhan. The damage caused by this delayed flight and luggage is difficult to quantify beside the cash penalty that I paid ($1,187.90). I would like per this complaint to explain all the negative impact I went through due to a delay of a Delta flight.Resolution: Sugar coated email with 7500 bonus point. Total disrespect to customer."
"""Completely ridiculous""","✅ Trip Verified | Was scheduled to fly from Medford to Seattle and end in Lihue, Kauai. Our flight was delayed multiple times making a 3 hour delay and would result in missing our connecting flight into Seattle to make it to Kauai. There were no later flights this same day to Kauai, so we were scheduled for the next morning to fly from Medford to Seattle (now we’ve missed our first night of vacation). After asking the airline how often this happens, she responded maybe 1/15 planes are delayed and was unlikely it would happen again. Then our next morning flight scheduled for 5.45am and was for the second time, delayed 3 hours to 8.30am and we were scheduled to miss our connecting flight in Seattle once again! Although Delta re-imbursed tickets and we will still make it to Kauai this evening through yet a third scheduling conflict - it has put us behind 24 hours into our trip. Needless to say I will not be planning on flying Delta Air Lines for quite some time- at least out of Medford. Completely ridiculous."
"""Avoid if you have other options""","✅ Trip Verified | Dublin to Toronto via Boston. Avoid the airline if you have other options. I have been left with no luggage almost 3 days now. No communication from the airline in regards to when I will have it delivered. No help at all. Ruined my holiday."
"""not seen the money""","✅ Trip Verified | Oslo to Minneapolis via Paris. My luggage got lost between Paris and Minneapolis on the 21st March. I received it on the 25th of May. I have a receipt and many emails saying I will be compensated USD 300 - I have still after three months not seen the money. I get emails from Delta all the time saying how sorry they are and that the amount will be put into my account but it never happens. All emails they send cannot be replied to. There is only one Norwegian phone number provided that transfers me to KLM Holland. They transfer me on to the USA where I am put on hold for long times. I hanged up once after 34 minutes. I have called and spoken to a number of people I have been transferred to but never end up with the right person. They all tell me to go to customer-care@delta.com. I have done that several times but only end up with emails saying how sorry the are and that the email cannot be replied to. I has been a nightmare and no one takes responsibility. But they are extremely good at saying how sorry they are and send email to me time after time that the money will be transferred to me!"
"""Better than expected""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Orlando. Better than expected experience on a US airline. The flight boarded and left on time. It arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Plenty of food and beverages during the flight. Friendly, capable, but very ""experienced"" flight attendants. The plane is old, this one was over 21 years old, but well maintained. Seat pitch in economy is tight. The IFE content is excellent, although the system had to be rebooted after take off, which took 30 minutes. Recommended. The ground handling at both Amsterdam, with the ridiculous questioning due to US regulation, and the line at Orlando for US immigration make DL to loose some stars, but can't be entirely attributed to the airline."
"""I vastly underestimated this trip""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Los Angeles to Dallas. I was not expecting much given the aircraft type and relatively short flight time but I vastly underestimated this trip. A wonderful flight attendant, a comfortable seat, great entertainment options and a terrific light supper. Not a single complaint only kudos to Delta for stepping up."
"""service is extremely lacking""","Not Verified | Kahului to Los Angeles. 7 months in advance. That is how far out we booked our travel plans. For the first time we decided to try first class. Now, the flight out was much better than the return which is what I am rating here. Note above my indication of how far out we booked. So, we checked in online and confirmed our return flight. We went to the airport and got our boarding passes (should have looked at them at the desk) but when we went to board were told we were in zone 2. Indeed the passes showed seats 24A and B. Went to counter to see what was the reason. Never got a clear reason. Change of plane (was same model as indicated on travel plans) a passenger being moved over (shouldn't we have been given priority?) and some other reason I cannot really recall right now. Let me also point out that our baggage was checked as if we were still first class which would seem odd if we were bumped to economy. Now, they told us we will receive vouchers because of this event (first class) and some refund. We are still awaiting an answer on that and our travel agent is helping. Then, oddly, just before we boarded, a seat opened up in first class. (No, we did not take it as we wanted to sit together) Delta, your service is extremely lacking. You had our contact information and never did so. Your ""explanation"" of the event was so full of holes, cheese cloth, in comparison, is wax paper."
"""each time it was delayed""","✅ Trip Verified | I rode 4 time with this airline, each time it was delayed. The last time it was delayed was to wait for 3 employees who were not even working on the airline. We waited 45 minutes for them. The other times they were delayed at least 2 hours. Extremely inconvenient. If I have a choice I will never fly with Delta Air Lines."
"""7+ hours behind schedule""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Madrid. Our flight was suppose to leave at 7PM after being delayed a few hour we finally took off around 11PM. After being in the air for almost 2 hrs we were told we had to return to New York because of mechanical issues. We then waited another couple of hours switched planes and didn't take off until almost 2an, some 7+ hours behind schedule. Would never consider flying this airline again, terrible experience."
"""Travel should not be this way""","Not Verified | I needed to change planes in Detroit. Flight was a little late but I knew on my boarding pass the gate was 71 - I was coming in at 78 - no worries. First, passengers need to check their luggage into the belly of the aircraft. So much time getting things out of overhead racks. People who are changing flights need to sit up front, not in the back of the plane, and I was in the very back of the plane. When I finally exited the plane, I learned that the gate is A49 in another terminal, take an escalator, catch a tram, etc - I have less than 20 minutes. I was running through the airport using escalator, tram, walkways and made it by the seat of my pants. Travel should not be this way!"
"""disappointed and frustrated""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas Ft Worth to Salt Lake City. Was told we had to check baggage because there was not enough room. We needed our carry ons but still forced to check. Getting on the plane, there was still plenty of room. Every crew member we talked to about this was rude and not accommodating. I am extremely disappointed and frustrated. I usually fly American and now will continue to do so."
"""toddler daughter 4 rows behind""","❌ Not Verified | Atlanta to San Jose. They knew that I am traveling with my wife and toddler daughter. They assigned my toddler daughter a seat 4 rows behind me and my wife’s seat. Who in the world will do this? Separating a toddler from their parents for 6 hours?"
"""bad communication about delays""","✅ Trip Verified | Miami to Chattanooga via Atlanta. Delta was not straight forward with communicating flight delays. Resulted in entire flight being told at 1:30am that the pilots left to get a hotel and our flight would leave 8am the next morning - after waiting at boarding area since 11pm. No hotel service offered by Delta and non available at 1:30am. Only option was to sleep at the airport. Following morning flight did not board at 8am and was continued to be delayed and told only after the boarding times came and went. Again Delta was not straight forward with the fact that numerous other flights were before ours and they knew the entire time our flight was never going to board at 8am. Renting a car and not going to wait around for Deltas lack of proper communication. Not the first time this has happened due to bad communication about delays!"
"""a great experience""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Atlanta. The seat was comfortable, the food was fresh and plentiful. The staff were kind and professional through out. All in all a great experience and a reasonable price with no downsides. Absolutely will fly with delta time and time again now."
"""flight is five hours delayed""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Shanghai via Detroit. This is the third consecutive flight that I’ve flown that has been delayed due to cabin crew rest and mechanical delays. This flight is five hours delayed. Delta Platinum reservations are awesome, but they’re the ones trying to get the money. Delta customer service is very lacking. The gentleman was extremely crude and belittling. I’ll comment on the ratings below. Value for money: Delta Economy is always the most expensive compared to other airline economy fares. In the last five months I’ve taken several flights and they’re the only ones grossly delayed. Ground service: Always great. Seat comfort: better than most. Cabin staff service: Always great Food and beverages: airline food Inflight entertainment: needs to be updated more often WiFi: unreliable."
"""Pleasant Flight""","❌ Not Verified | Madrid to Atlanta. Pleasant Flight. Seat Configuration was 2-3-2. Good Movie selection. Smooth ride. Main meal (lunch) ok, Snacks started as almonds and snack mix, then a small assortment of crackers cheese chocolate, etc and ending with magnum ice-cream bar. 3 x drink service, plus bottles of water and coffee/tea service. This was an Air France code share operated by Delta - got a really good price right after New Years. on IAD-BCN, Madrid IAD multi-city flight. Seat comfort much better than AF outbound. Couldn't get the limited wi-fi to work. Best transatlantic flight I can remember."
"""flights are not there""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Portland. When I login to https://www.delta.com and try to find my purchased flights, they are not there. Every other airline website keeps track of my trips for me, but Delta's website does not. To look up a trip, I have to enter information for each flight so Delta can look them up. I purchased a flight for a family member and never received an email confirmation. Therefore, I didn't have the information to enter into Delta's website to look up the purchased flight. Infuriating!"
"""Greatly Upsetting""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Las Vegas. On Sat May 19th, 2018 My husband and I arrived at the gate - plane terminal at 2:55 after waiting around the airport since 1:00. I followed a woman to the ramp of the plane where she did not return for almost 8 minutes later. Our plane was to depart at 3:15. When she returned, I told her our names, she told us we had missed our flight and there was nothing that could be done, that we needed to go over to the phones ""customer service"" to find out when the next flight would be available. My husband and I followed instructions and immediately went to the phones, during this time that I was placed on hold, handing the phone to my husband, I had then witnessed a gentleman in a red coat assist a person onto our plane? Next flight available to Seattle would not be until the following day departing at 3:15. This cost us additional rental car and another expensive nights hotel stay considering it being a weekend with several conventions going on. Our luggage had went on to Seattle along with some very needed medications causing me to flare into a major migraine not able to rid for days, until finally my Dr. was able to give some relief by giving a (nerve block) shot. All of this because we had arrived 20 minutes prior to plane departure. My husband and I have never been treated so poorly in our entire life. Greatly Upsetting."
"""no to Delta in future""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Seattle. The boarding staff was extremely rude and impolite. Seemed like they were taking out their frustration on the passengers. A big big no to Delta in future."
"""become progressively worse""","✅ Trip Verified | Kahului, Maui to Los Angeles. I fly First Class usually on Delta or one of their partners. I have noticed in the last year that the service quality has become progressively worse. On my most recent flights to and from Hawaii, I noticed that First Class seat pitch has become shorter. Could not even cross my legs. Seat could not recline more then 2"". Food on this flight (lunch) was disgusting. Salad was inedible. This not worth the price anymore."
"""Huge mistake""","✅ Trip Verified | I usually fly United but today went Delta flying from Philadelphia to Washington Dulles via Knoxville. Huge mistake. The persons working the gate were rude and condescending. I almost missed my connecting flight because of the ineptness of the staff at Atlanta-Hartsfield. Will never fly Delta again!"
"""Worst experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Oklahoma City via Atlanta. While I am waiting on my flight, I got a total of 25 text messages telling me that the gate has changed or the time of departure has changed. 6 Gate changes. 19 departure time changes. First they said we were delayed because the plane in our gate from the flight before needed some maintenance but our plane was waiting just outside. Then our plane pulls in, and it is out of service for maintenance. Then they say there is another plane on its way that will take us. Then that plane gets here and there are missing crew members we have to wait on. All in all it was delayed 3 1/2 hours. During all of this, when it is clear I won't make my connecting flight, we talk to customer service who says go ahead and get on the flight and the gate attendant will give you a hotel voucher when you get there because the flight I would be missing is the last one out. We say okay, no problem. I get there and go to the gate attendant. He says, you need to go to customer service. I go to customer service, stand in line for an hour, they say, go to a gate attendant. I go back to a gate attendant. By this time I am so angry and upset I am on the verge of crying, but I am trying to be polite to this innocent gate attendant that is getting caught in the crossfire. She finally takes pity on me, looks it up and says that she will give me a hotel voucher and gives me some tips about when to come back in the morning because it is one of their busiest times. Then I go catch a shuttle to the hotel, but have to wait for the 3rd shuttle because there are so many people in the same situation. Then the hotel has a line out the door to get checked in so by the time I actually get the key to the hotel room, I have three hours before I have to leave for the airport again. Worst experience ever."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Atlanta. While boarding the plane they told me and my kids that we had to check our bag that they told us we could bring on. There were about 15 people behind us with bigger bags and they did not make them check their bags. Great job Delta. This was the worst flight of my life will never fly Delta again. Great job."
"""treat passengers horribly""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Fargo. This is the worst flight I have ever been on, and I have been on many flights throughout my life. After traveling more than 10 hours through the UK and Amsterdam (and waiting for another 10 hours in airports) we arrived in Minneapolis. We only had one more hour to go before being able to get home and go to sleep, when Delta happened. Despite troublesome weather, we were still set to depart on time, which was a relief - at first. We boarded the plane, as normal, and then waited. For more than two hours. No acknowledgement was made by Delta that this flight would be late; instead, they kept stating that it would only be another ""10 minutes"" before we could take off. Ten minutes turned into changing the route, having to add fuel (a 45 minute venture) and adding half an hour to the new flight time. Don't fly with Delta. Instead of taking ownership over their mistakes (like not marking the flight as delayed or boarding us despite bad weather) they will instead treat their passengers horribly when they try to figure out what is going on and respond rudely when the passengers question when they will be leaving. Worst flight of my life, and I do not recommend."
"""sometimes the seats get scrambled""","✅ Trip Verified | Kansas City to Los Angeles. Delta separated my wife’s and my seat at check in. I picked our seats at booking so we’d be sitting together. My wife gets really nervous about flying. I called them to see what the deal was with her getting bumped from her assigned seat. I was told there was a schedule change and seats sometimes the seats get scrambled and there was nothing they could do. I could, however, pay additional for 2 premium seats together or ask a stranger to switch me seats. It’s not the end of the world, but when a business makes a mistake they should at least try to make an effort to fix it. Not in this case."
"""thoughtful and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | I have a flight scheduled for June. When I made my reservation mid January of this year, I inadvertently booked my round-trip ticket to leave the same day I am going there. Although it took some transferring and time on hold, once I got to the right place, they corrected this error for me even though it was an economy ticket and were very thoughtful and helpful about it."
"""one of my worst experiences on Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | This past Sunday was one of my worst experiences on Delta. The plane was completely overbooked and the flight attendant was rude. I was sitting in the back row and before going down we were not informed that all over head storage was completely full. So instead a rude flight attendant tells me to stand to the side and wait with my carry on out of everyone’s way. Well I was still in your customers way and had them angrily telling me to move. I then waited for everyone to be seated and they made me carry my bag back to the front of the plane before I was able to be seated. All while being 6 months pregnant, they could of been friendly and they also could of taken my bag for me instead of making me stand in the aisle. Now I have another flight this weekend with Delta and I’m not looking forward to it."
"""3 faults in 2 legs""","✅ Trip Verified | Tried to leave Monday. Plane failed, flight cancelled. Tues at Spokane, passenger check-in electronics failed. Tues at MSP. Plane failed. Waiting on replacement. 3 faults in 2 legs. Provided overnight at Ramada, an aged facility. Dirty cup found in room. 15 miles from anywhere. Not provided food vouchers, food was priced for its captive market. Inadequate explanation at Spokane led to long, slow, line. Called customer service on Delta provided card. First contact was not fluent. And would not make a reschedule without a fee. He did forward me to someone that would, but has to retell the story."
"""thank for the great attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to San Jose. I want to thank everyone for the great attitude and the great response to my mom's needs, she has high blood pressure and diabetic also her first time traveling by her self, the trip was long but everyone was very attentive. I think the prices for the 3rd baggage is completely unreasonable $150 to $200 for a 3rd bag is way too much. 1st bag $25-- 2nd bag $40 but the website does not specify the prices after that unless you actually spend sometime reading and clicking every single link."
"""a horrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Vancouver via Seattle. How can this happen? Got a fight update in the middle of the night saying that Delta changed my flight schedule. The new flight had me landing in Seattle at 6pm with a connection to Vancouver at 5pm and it showed a -1 hour connection! hHow am I suppose to catch a connecting flight that leaves an hour before I land. Who was in charge of that! Makes no sense!! Why would you even change the flight to that time. Is this how you treat your customers? Such a horrible experience, now I have to go deal with this. Don’t choose Delta Air Lines!"
"""worst flying experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Detroit. This was the worst flying experience I have had in 10 years. The BWI kiosks did not work to get luggage, the counter lady was horrible and nasty. I can't imagine who hired this woman but she was totally unfit for the job. Fly Southwest, United or anyone but Delta."
"""Done with Delta.""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Charlotte. Booked 3 passengers, myself included, at a total of $650 and change. I was never told we would be charged to change to an earlier flight within 24 hours. A few days passed, we need to arrive earlier and the lady on the phone told me that it would be $200 per tickets to change it in the computer. $200 per, to change the flight in the computer in 30 seconds! Are you out of your mind. We’ve only used Delta since 2009 since we’ve had good experiences with them over other airlines. I guess that’s going to change. The lady on the phone practically laughed. Ridiculous and basically criminal. Done with Delta."
"""expect to arrive on time""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Phoenix to New York. Every time I use Delta Air Lines for my travel, I encounter flight delays one way or another. This is a huge disappointment. We, customers, expect to arrive on time to our destinations. Once or twice delays are acceptable, though I had all my flights with Delta delayed. Even though the service is okay, I would rate them 1/10."
"""not what I requested""","✅ Trip Verified | Tel Aviv to New York. They gave me a seat which not what I requested. Asked for coffee took an hour to get to me - I had to ask again I'm coming home United States they put me on a regular seat which I made it very clear I can not sit because of my knees. Next time I fly with Turkish Airlines."
"""we felt very welcomed""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Dallas. On our flight today we felt very welcomed and well taken care of by the flight attendants who were very attentive, polite and sweet. They definitely made our flight more enjoyable."
"""flights are late""","✅ Trip Verified | Norfolk to Melbourne. The last time I will fly Delta. Delta flights are late, delayed, and poor. I am a frequent flier of many airlines, and they, by far, rate the poorest for flights arriving timely."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | New York LGA to Charlestown. When I booked the trip I paid one price for myself and a higher price for my mom’s ticket. I was unhappy to over pay for her ticket and had planned to call for a price adjustment on that. By the time I called I checked the current price and it was $30 less than my original ticket and $80 less than my mom’s ticket. When I called to request a price adjustment the lady refused. I think that is a horrible business practice. Southwest would credit me in a minute no questions asked. Instead this lady tries comparing my purchase to buying a pair of jeans at final sale?! It’s not a pair of jeans, it’s a flight that hasn’t even been taken yet! I think it’s disgusting to do that and will never fly Delta again as a result! Don’t think that is worth the price adjustment!"
"""In-flight service was mediocre""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Los Angeles. Not a pleasant experience for the most part. In-flight service was mediocre. I would actually give the in-flight entertainment a high score, but they actually charge you money for head phones if you actually want to use them The staff were amicable. That’s my best I can give."
"""do not recommend this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | I was supposed to fly Delta Airlines from New York to Jacksonville last night but I never got on the plane. The flight got delayed 3 times, then at the last minute decided to cancel the flight because there were no flight attendants. The most frustrating part of the experience was that after waiting so long to get on the plane, I had to wait another 2 hours in a customer service line where no help at all was offered. I do not recommend this airline."
"""two stellar attendants""","✅ Trip Verified | Pasco to John wayne via Seattle. I would like to send a huge thank you out to two stellar attendants on both of our flights. Both were kind and accommodating to me and my friends. The generosity and good humor made what would have been an ordinary flight memorable and awesome. The absolute best way to start a mini vacation."
"""inaccurately received texts""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been on many airplanes over the past ten years and this was by far the worst experience. Me and my roommate inaccurately received texts that our plane was delayed 2 hours. Therefore we missed our 5:30pm flight and instead of arriving home that night at 11pm as scheduled we were forced to sleep in the airport overnight. We did not return home until the following day at 11am. Delta customer service was terrible and did nothing to compensate us for our crisis. Do not fly with Delta, they are only good for wasting your time and money."
"""never get my money again""","❌ Not Verified | New York JFK to Aruba. I will never fly with Delta again, everything about them is unorganized. My boyfriend and I were taking a trip to Aruba, they stated that seats would be assigned when boarding. We spoke to the agent multiple times that we need to sit together, even though you think they would automatically do that since we purchased 2 tickets together! It's one of those simple things that makes a trip, instead of sitting next to my partner, I get a 4 hour flight between 2 random people! Horrible experience overall, they'll never get my money again."
"""this time was the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to Aruba via New York. I have had good experiences in the past with Delta, but this time was the worst. Though it was not their fault there was fog and we couldn’t land, we missed our connecting flight at the JFK airport, and that’s where I had issues. The next flight out was the next morning, we had to get a hotel which was fine, our luggage was no where to be found. We asked for the luggage to be pulled we waited an hour and a half, and found one of our bags out of four. The issue I had was no one was watching the pulled bag area. My brother who’s bag was pulled was sitting in the middle of the terminal unattended. We walked over to the bag and sure enough it was his. No one checked his bag ticket and no one even saw him take it. Very disappointed, and still waiting on three of our four bags, 3 hours later."
"""allergies started going crazy""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Nashville. Let me say how accommodating and kind the flight attendants were. Thank you so much. There were two dogs in the main cabin and I have recently discovered that I am allergic to some dogs. On the opposite window seat was there was a passenger with a dog. Of course, my new allergies started going crazy! The flight attendant was going to upgrade me to first class but there was a dog there also and only God knows if I was allergic to that breed. I was moved to the back of the plane and allergies were kept at a minimum the entire flight. Delta, please come up with some kind of system to inform passengers that animals will be in the main cabin. Had it been a Pekingese dog, we would have had to stop the plane because I wouldn’t have been able to breathe. Seems like a liability suit waiting to happen."
"""a huge unexpected bonus""","✅ Trip Verified | I typically don't fly Delta as I collect points on One World and Star Alliance, however the timing of this flight suited me. In addition it was close to 6 hours long so I was interested in travelling first class. To my surprise the first class ticket was only $200 more than the economy and around half the price of United. The plane was new, the interior and seats nicely appointed, food passable and IFE was excellent. Although the movie selection wasn't great, live TV (including sports) made up for this. For and internal US flight, the fact that it took off and landed on time was a huge unexpected bonus. I will consider moving programs to Skyteam as I think they're impressive."
"""request was rather rudely denied""","✅ Trip Verified | Miami to Atlanta via Greensboro. A last minute business trip prevented my husband from using his Delta Comfort return ticket. At the gate in Miami I requested to have his seat since my husband paid for the unused non -refundable ticket. I had both boarding passes to prove it. My request was rather rudely denied because my seat was a reward ticket. Upon boarding I found a non- rev flight attendant already comfy and cozy in the seat my husband bought. There were other empty seats on the flight, Very, very bad policy and very rude cs to favor a non-rev employee over the wife of a gold medallion status customer!"
"""wait at airport for 10:30 hours""","✅ Trip Verified | I booked from Delta's site my tickets for Sydney to Denver via LA. My flight from Denver to LA was delayed and I lost the flight back to Sydney. I was supposed to arrive at LA at 21:30 but I arrived at 00:30. Delta booked me a hotel at LA in order to get the next flight to Sydney which was planned for next day at 22:30. The problem is that I had to check out from the hotel at 12:00, which means that I had to wait at the airport for 10:30 hours. Delta also gave me one coupon to have lunch (one meal in 24 hours, thanks Delta for keeping me slim). The best part of the story, however, is that I got a seat next to a giant guy so I had to sit in half seat during my flight. I asked several times the crew to take me to another seat, but they couldn't find any, although this was not true (I spotted empty seats 3 & 5 rows in front of me)."
"""a great experience""","❌ Not Verified | I couldn’t be more pleased with my Delta experience. I flew on Thursday May 3rd, LGA to DEN and returned on May 6th. Both flights were on time, the plane was clean, entertainment was great (TV on each seat), snacks and drinks were plenty and the flight attendants were excellent. I am a Delta sky member, which gives you a free checked bag (not many airlines havec that anymore). Overall, a great experience!"
"""will never fly Delta again!""","❌ Not Verified | Toronto to Ft Myers via La Guardia. The airline would not send a boarding pass to my phone. When I got to the airport, the kiosk would not print a boarding pass. There was no customer service rep at the desk. Consequently, by the time I was able to connect to a rep from Dallas, I had missed my flight. She rebooked me on a later flight, with two layovers, and charged me $119.00 for increase in fare. I received an email shortly thereafter that the flight was delayed, and that I may not make my connector flight. Once again, I called a rep who verified such, and she booked me on a flight going out the next day, the same trip I had originally booked, only one day later. I am now told, that even though I didn't take the first rebooked flight, the additional fees were not refundable. It was never brought to my attention that this was the case, I never even printed a ticket for such flight, that may have disclosed this. I will never fly Delta again!"
"""I would fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Papeete via Los Angeles, the flight to Tahiti with Air France. Celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in Tahiti. We travel extensively and I submit reviews whenever possible for all types of service, whether for good or bad but with honestly. Flying out of Minneapolis on Delta we sat on the tarmac for over and hour because of mechanical/electrical issues. Even tho the issue was not fixed, de-icing proceeded and we left for take off. Our connecting flight was in LA where we actually made it to the gate with well over 45 minutes before the boarding process. Our bags however, did not make that connection which we discovered upon arrival in Papeete. Took 3 days for Air France to deliver our stuff to Bora Bora. I realize these things happen and feel that Air France was at fault. The issue was ""what airline do I file a reimbursement for necessities""? Air France strung me along for 4 weeks before I finally found someone who indicated Delta would be the one to reimburse. The whole Air France filing process is a joke. So today I received my $194 check from Delta and am extremely happy that I could actually get some compensation. Trust me you do not want to shop in Tahiti on a Sunday for toothpaste/toothbrushes and swimsuits. Thank you Delta, it is much appreciated. On a side note, I would fly Delta again and also Air France where the service and food were exceptional, even back in steerage."
"""Absolutely horrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Los Angeles. Absolutely horrible experience with these guys. First and last trip with them. Put on a standby list for no apparent reason! Charged for luggage even after showing them my military identification. Was told I had to be in uniform. The desk receptionist was horrible at customer service, handed him my credentials and he placed everything on the desk instead of handing them back to me. I wouldn’t suggest this airline to anyone!"
"""kindly train your staff""","✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Pensacola. We were told that our skymiles (3 people) would be added to our account in a week's time and guess what, after spending over 2 hours on the phone, the Supervisor in Dallas tells us, those 3 agents from Delta, (that we spent over 2 hours on the phone with), gave us the wrong information. I am writing this review for whoever flies Delta. When you find a deal on say, Expedia, for any Delta flights, before proceeding with your booking, call Delta with the details of that particular flight, ask them to match the price and ensure that the skymiles are added to your account. It seems like the Customer service department is very poorly trained and therefore every representative gives you different information. My message to Delta Airlines is, kindly train your staff well so they know what the heck is going on. Also, it is imperative that Delta customer service agents take responsibility for each other's actions and Delta Airlines as a Whole, rather than saying, its not my department or the Delta agent gave you the wrong information, they didn't know etc. Thank you."
"""taking my business elsewhere""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to New York JFK. I don’t know what has happened to Delta. I fly them almost exclusively and have seen their service continue to decline. On this trip outbound from JFK surprising I did not get my upgrade. First problem the cabin interior was old and stodgy. The entertainment system needed to be rebooted twice and the GOGO WiFi was a NOGO. Worst of all my seat did not recline. Lovely for a transcon flight. On my return I got my upgrade but shockingly the tray table in my premium economy seat was broken. I had to eat from my lap. In all my travels never had a tray table been broken in an upgrade section of a plane. Especially on an important business route. I’m taking my business elsewhere to try someone else."
"""I'll avoid it like the plague""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Costa Rica via Atlanta. When I booked tickets on the Delta website earlier this year to fly from London to Costa Rica I got all the way to the final screen without any problems only to find that when I clicked 'Buy' a pop up screen appeared telling me that there was now a high demand for these seats and if I wanted them I'd have to pay a couple of hundred dollars more. Delta might find this to be a great way to screw extra money out of your customers (and after all, they are an American company) and it might even be legal; but it's dishonest, unethical and just plain wrong. I've never known this from any other airline in over 40 years of flying. Secondly, as we flew over the Atlantic my wife and I were on the extreme right hand side of the plane, the guy on the same row in seat A had his window open - everyone else had their windows closed as the sun was low and very bright. This caused everyone in the row to have very bright sunlight in their eyes, we all complained to the stewardess who told us that the guy needed to work on his computer and so needed the window open to see the keyboard, I have to note that the window was partially closed so there was no sunlight in his eyes, just everyone elses. No matter how many times we complained the stewardess refused to tell the guy to close the window, so this went on for several hours, it made it difficult to see the entertainment, it made it impossible to sleep and it made the whole experience very unpleasant. Given the way several US airlines have treated their passengers over the past year I doubt that I'll ever fly on an American carrier again, they obviously don't care about passengers. As a further point, Atlanta airport is the biggest dump I've ever had to spend any time in, I'll avoid it like the plague in future"
"""never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Dallas Ft Worth. Worst experience. Had a 8pm flight and wanted to reach back home early and so reached airport at 5.30 to see if I could into an earlier flight. It seems the flight that was to leave at 3.30pm was delayed and leaving at 6.15pm but couldn’t get a spot there and is understandable. I sat patiently to get my flight at 8 when it was announced that the flight is delayed and would go only at 10. The plane came in late and we boarded and was to leave at 10.20. But captain announced they are waiting on some equipment alignment and kept the plane oh hold without any further announcement. It’s gong to be 11pm now and the flight is still grounded. Bad day overall and never fly Delta again. I fly American most of the time and have 150,000 flying miles and have faced issues but never got this kind of pathetic service."
"""not happy with the customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | The food and TVs were great. It was a comfortable ride and the snacks and beverages were the best I’ve had, however I was not happy with the customer service. The flight attendants (all males) were extremely rude to my husband and I. They had an attitude with everything they were doing, I’ve never experienced service like that. Usually flight attendants are always super accommodating and sweet. Disappointed about this Delta!"
"""wonderful staff of Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Edmonton to Minneapolis. I would like to give a shout out to the wonderful staff of Delta Airlines flight 2247 on May 2nd. I forgot something in the airport and security would not let me leave the aircraft. The pilot went and got it for me! They are the best! The whole crew was so personable through the whole flight. Nice to see people who like their job and are there to service their customers."
"""put my bag on a flight 4 hrs behind""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to New York JFK. Delta continually lets me down. This is not my first encounter with them , but surely this is the last. Their workers are not very helpful and very dismissive. They mistakenly put my bag on a flight 4 hrs behind me when I have another to catch."
"""Enjoyed an excellent flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Enjoyed an excellent flight with Delta from London Heathrow to Atlanta on 19 April. Delta uses the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse in Heathrow which is a fantastic lounge. On board, the Delta One product was excellent in terms of the seat itself, food and beverage quality and the service from the crew. The departure of the flight was delayed slightly due to the late arrival of the inbound aircraft but arrival in Atlanta was on time. The IFE system was reliable and had an extensive selection of content. The onboard WiFi was however quite unreliable."
"""Horrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Orlando. Horrible experience. Booked flight month in advance. Fixed seats via Delta website. Day before flight could not checkin online. On airport got on standby, without any reason. Only at gate KLM lady fixed seats. We have 2 young kids. On flight the purser was horrible. At Orlando we had to stand in line for 2 hours before we could collect the baggage. Horrible airport experience."
"""flight attendant refused to help""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta has always earned my praises for their customer service until today. They seated our 5 year old in the exit row with us then reseated him by himself. The flight attendant refused to help and told me to exit the plane and speak to the gate agent who also refused to assist. There were 20 open seats on the plane two in the “comfort area” which they refused to let us use. Second leg my daughter was seated two rows from her two year old. Ended up there were duplicate tickets and she had to put him on her lap for a two and a half hour flight. Keep in mind she paid for a seat. No customer service in either case. I wouldn’t recommend Delta to anyone traveling with children."
"""Now I’m stuck in the airport""","✅ Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta. First of all we booked a flight through Expedia then we get to Delta only for them not to find our flight info, we had to go through 2 places and by the time Delta found it we missed our first flight. Then get to the gate today to leave for my flight at 09.45 only to hear that’s its delayed and we have to wait 2 hours for them to get a part. Now I’m stuck in the airport again missing a flight because of the plane and going to be late."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Denver. Very professional service, from the check-in counters (at SEA and DEN) to the gate and then onboard. The snacks offered were somewhat minimal, but better than on many other airlines I have flown."
"""very poor quality service""","✅ Trip Verified | Quito to Atlanta. The most disappointing business class I have ever flown. Boarding took ages. Airline doesn’t have agreement with business lounge so I couldn’t get in. The sits are very uncomfortable and they don’t even lie down the way they normally do in any other business class. Very, very poor quality service. Avoid. My first and last time"
"""I was disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Des Moines to Sacramento via Salt Lake City. My daughter initially bought my ticket and I paid $237 to upgrade to 1st class. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement! I’ve usually fly American so this was the first experience with Delta - I boarded at 5:2o am so thought we would have breakfast- wrong! They offered a box of rice Chex and a drink and that was it! My next flight from SLC was no better-got a sack of chips and a Diet Coke! Will definitely go back to American where you get more for the money!"
"""make you check your bags""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Seattle. I hate it when you get to the gate and they make you check your bags. Of course, when I get on the plane there is plenty of room to store my bag. This is supposed to be one of the more premium airlines now, not. The last thing a customer wants to do when arriving late is wait a long time for their bags to come through the damn shoot. Thanks a ton"
"""Overall a solid 10""","✅ Trip Verified | Austin to Palm Springs via Minneapolis. Comfortable B717 to the Twin Cities. 6am flight called for a Bloody Mary, had a refill at the gate too. Once airborne, a really nice breakfast sandwich, which I was not looking forward too, as I usually prefer omelets, potatoes, etc. Really surprised at the quality here. Accompanied by very fresh fruit and more Bloody Marys. Departed and arrived on schedule. 2 hours in the renovated Sky Club in MSP. This is where Delta has really started to pull ahead. Their lounges have upgraded food options, with hot and cold items available. The standard free liquor is fine, but reasonable cost to upgrade to the premium stuff. B738 from MSP to PSP, a 3.5hr flight. An extremely nice lunch with chilled Salmon and Quinoa, followed by dessert. Enjoyed a great selection of wines, while watching a few movies to help pass the time. On-time departure and arrival, with a quick collection of our bags in PSP. Overall a solid 10 for our day of traveling."
"""there's no respect for customers""","✅ Trip Verified | Portland to Paris via Seattle with Delta Air Lines. Me and my husband booked our flights from Tel Aviv to Portland and vice versa via CheapOair, flying with KLM, Delta and Air France. The departing flights with a layover in Amsterdam ( with KLM) were great, however the returning flights operated by Delta and Air France were an horrendous experience! It began 2 days before our departure. We received an email notification that our returning flights have been rescheduled. We were not satisfied with the change, and spent more than an hour on an international call with cheapOair customer service to make sure we will depart at the original time and will remain seated together. While booking we paid to CheapOair to ensure we will be seated together, and they ensured us that even though the assigned seats may change, we will be together. In the updated itinerary all seemed OK, and we left for our trip thinking it is. When we checked in to our departing flights the evening before (3 flights with layovers in Seattle and Paris) we were shocked to see we were seated separately in all of them! Air France from Paris to Tel Aviv was the worst, with me being seated in the first rows and my husband in the back. What was even worse is we saw on one of the flights there was a free seat next to my husband, but to choose it meant to pay 60$ extra. Why would they separate us in the first place when there were seats available? Were we suppose to pay for something we already paid for?! We tried to call to Delta customer service, only to wait for more than 2 hours. Left our local sim number and they called back after 3 hours, said they transfer me to international flights customers service, and this time had to wait for another half an hour, left my number and they never called back. Our layovers were very short and we were nervous we won't be able talk with Delta representatives in the airports on time When we got to the airport at Portland, there were no Delta representatives to talk to. Next to the gate however were phones direct to customer service, on which luckily there wasn't any wait time, but the representative wasn't very helpful. When she was told all that we've been through she was silent and couldn't help us reassign the seats. She sent us to the gate to try and fix that. At the gate, representative got us new seats together on our flights from USA to Paris in a few moments. When asked what was the problem to do so from the beginning, she blamed it on Air France in Paris rescheduling one of the original flights and said it also caused the mess with the seats. She also couldn't reassign our seats from Paris to Tel Aviv. When boarded on the plane to Paris, we had a delay of a half an hour because safety buckles were missing and waited for the crew to bring it. After a long wait, apparently they brought the wrong buckles and had to return with the right once. We were afraid we were going to miss our next flight. The flight to Tel Aviv was not any better. Once again, there were seats together we were reassigned to without any problem, and yet again there was a delay of half an hour after boarding because the water system of the plane needed to be checked. Lucky we didn't miss our flights and got home safely! What bothered us the most, however, is that changing our seats seemed like a deliberate move to try make us pay more. Obviously there's no respect for customers. Flying with low cost companies is better than Delta!"
"""professionalism at it's best""","✅ Trip Verified | Indianapolis to Minneapolis. I am in a wheelchair, needing much support. Staff at the check in desk was amazing. Due to mechanical error, the flight was delayed 5 hrs. She kept coming back onto the plane, even though I know she must have a lobby full of angry other passengers. This was professionalism at it's best. Those of us who need that extra little help truly appreciate that 'extra mile' being taken. This lady is a treasure and you should take good care of her."
"""I will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Columbus via Los Angeles. My flight has been delayed multiple times without anyone from Delta knowing the reason. Not only will I miss my connecting flight in LAX home to Columbus OH but their only solution is to get me home at 6pm Monday night via another connection. How is this viable or an answer? Offered no solution to get me home any sooner and no hotel or anything as a solution to my being stranded in San Diego. I will never fly Delta again, I paid $600 for this flight"
"""we got great assistance""","✅ Trip Verified | From air to land, we got great assistance. We were travelling from Amsterdam to Seattle on 31st March 2018 with our 3 kids aged 6, 4 and 4 months old infant. We had 12 pieces of luggage since we were moving in Seattle for a long period of time. Our main concern was how to handle the kids and have the luggage transported from the airport to our house (including 3 car seats and a booster). After asking our flight attendant, he has spoken with his colleague and before we knew it, they came out of their way to help us load all luggage into their personal vehicles and had everything delivered to our house. They made our trip look so seamless. Great applause to Delta and your great staff members."
"""never fly this airline again.""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline experience ever. Flying from Cozumel thru Atlanta on 4/15/18. Our connecting flight in ATL was delayed due to a scheduling error by the airline. Once that was resolved we got on the plane, but were again delayed. We sat on the tarmac for 2 hrs before the plane returned to the gate due to a mechanical error. By now it was nearly midnight. Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 9:15 pm. We were then told no flight was available til 7:00 am the next day and we’d be given hotel vouchers, but would need to be back at the airport by 5:00 am. The line to get the vouchers had several hundred people in it because Delta had screwed up other flights that night and stretched practically outside the bldg. it took several hours to get through the line (because Delta only had 3 people working the desk) which meant that by the time most passengers got the vouchers it was too late to go to the hotel. In addition, we were told that we could get a later flight but needed to call Delta. When we did, we were told hold times were over 2 hours! The vast majority of passengers ended up having to sleep in the airport. Total incompetence by Delta in every way. The few staff that were on hand were impatient and rude. I will never fly this airline again."
"""the plane was very dirty""","✅ Trip Verified | Rome to San Francisco via Atlanta. Terrible experience! They used a 767 for a 11-hour international flight, the plane was very dirty and run-down. The touch screen on the entertainment TV barely worked. The volume was also way too quiet and I could barely hear my movie over people coughing loudly. The second segment from ATL to SFO was much worse despite being only half as long. Boarding took forever and I got stuck sitting next to a man with a nasty cold. His constant loud coughing/sneezing/grunting made it impossible for me to sleep on the near-red eye flight. When we landed it took 30 minutes before we went up to the gate. For some reason that always happens every time I fly Delta. Anyway, baggage claim also took longer than usual because an announcement said the cargo door was having difficulty opening properly and because the carousel wasn't decided until the last second. I'm never flying Delta again unless they upgrade their aircraft and stop overestimating the arrival times. My flight to SFO was estimated to be 6 hours, so the ground staff at the destination prepared for that duration. But since the actual flight time was only 5 hours, we had to wait longer to go up to the gate. By the way, the 737 used for the second flight segment was much more cramped than the ones used by United, and I flew first class."
"""seat also didn’t recline""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle to Boston. I used my company’s travel agency to switch my flight back to Boston to the red eye. I didn’t realize that the agency booked me in the row in front of the emergency exit, meaning the seats in that row don’t recline and it would require me trying to sleep while sitting at a 90 degree angle. There were many open seats after takeoff so I moved to the row in front of me. There was one man in that row in the aisle seat, and his wife was adjacent in another empty row. He very reluctantly allowed me to pass him to sit in the window seat of his row after I explained I wanted to sleep before returning to work in Boston the next morning. Not 20 minutes after I had fallen asleep, the Emporer of aisle 15 had gotten the flight attendant to ask me to evacuate “his” row. The attendant said that I was sitting in an economy plus row. No problem; I did not pay for an economy plus ticket and was more than happy to move to any other row with a reclining chair. I asked her to please tell me where I can move to another open seat. “Sure”, she says, and walks away. I gather my belonging and she comes back to say rudely “You have to move”. I asked if she knew which seat I could move to, and she said there should be some in the back. Super helpful. The only open economy seat was at the very back row which also didn’t recline."
"""six flights were on schedule""","✅ Trip Verified | This is a broad overview of six domestic flights on Delta I took on the space of four days. I was very pleasantly surprised. All six flights were on schedule. Transfer at busy Atlanta was smooth. Flight attendants were welcoming. Leg space was adequate. Cabin was clean and bright. Ground staff at the gates were accommodating. In flight service offered a choice of four snack items. Luggage was brought out quickly enough jet side on arrival. IFE offered various choices - bring your own earphones."
"""worst communication to their passengers""","✅ Trip Verified | The last three Delta flights I have been on have always been delayed due to 'mechanical errors'. Being that Delta tickets are more expensive you would think they would have nicer planes. The last flight I was on was delayed for two hours while we were sitting on the runway and the captain of the flight didn’t even tell us what was going on. The flight leaving to Minneapolis from Anchorage was delayed by almost 6 hours! Seriously, they have a record of being the most delayed, slow and honestly the worst communication to their passengers. Since I live in Alaska there are very few airlines to choose from but if I had a choice I would avoid flying with them at all cost."
"""the same cabin, same food""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Amsterdam. This review is for the Premium Economy. First, I did not see the difference with the economy until I noticed a little red strip on the seats. When asked, they are said to have more space between rows. Not very visible. Especially since you are in the same cabin, same food. By the way, now access to priority lane or else. Just a boarding before economy. I fail to see the advantage. Due to poor choice, crazy price, and a time constraint I had no choice but to take this airline and premium eco. I ll avoid this airline like the plague. One last thing. I asked on both way to be upgraded, I was ready to pay for it. Not possible! You have to do it 72h before - even in the 80s some airlines were upgrading you at the boarding desk."
"""another disappointing trip""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Tampa to Milwaukee. Wanted to give them another chance but was left with another disappointing trip. Bags were left in the rain after we were rushed to get on a plane that didn’t take off for another hour and a half. All our clothes are soaked and this will be the last time flying with Delta Air Lines."
"""$75 dollar standby fee""","✅ Trip Verified | Our flight from Kauai to Seattle left my family and me with a 4 hour layover before departing to Portland. (It only takes 2.5 hours to drive). A Delta flight with many seats available was departing 2 hours earlier. Delta however charges a $75 dollar standby fee per ticket to be bumped up to the earlier flight. Thats more than the cost of the original tickets. For a family of 4 thats an additional $300. This is why we will never fly Delta again."
"""Horrible customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Kona to San Francisco via Los Angeles. Never have I used such an unhelpful airline. Horrible customer service. I also flew Delta into Hawaii and the flight attendants were horrible and extremely unhelpful with helping me get overhead bin space, they would not help me figure out where my connecting gate was even though I had only 20 minutes to make that flight. On the way back the flight attendants were more helpful but when I arrived into LAX there was a flight leaving for SFO shortly so I asked if I could take the earlier flight so as to avoid waiting 2 hours in an overcrowded waiting room that did not have enough seats. I was told there was room and I could get on the earlier flight. Then my name was looked up and they told me that since I had an economy ticket I could not change anything and could not get on the earlier flight. I have never heard of an airline doing this - regardless of your ticket type, why would I not be able to get on the exact same flight 2 hours earlier while I was in the airport with no checked luggage. I am furious and will no longer be flying Delta."
"""Customer service was horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Customer service was horrible once I reached Atlanta. I went from smiles and people willing to lend a hand to help us find where we were going to Delta employees who look at you not smiling, not engaging at all in conversation for directions, a lady who told me to keep watching the board for help and walked off. So very unprofessional! I loved my flight until I reached Atlanta and there found out I'm only a number."
"""customer support doesn't actually help customers""","✅ Trip Verified | Airlines like Delta don't actually care about their customers. The lower level staff members generally do, but the company itself and higher ups (aka policy makers) clearly don't. The customer support team and staff agents are virtually powerless and can't really help customers when it matters. Policies are in place to prevent the customer support team from helping the customers by doing simple things like waiving fees or making flight changes easier. The only thing it seems like staff members have the authority to do is provide customers with an extra set of Biscoffs during in-flight service. It's unfortunate because I used to love Delta but now feel a strong sense of distrust and dissatisfaction with the brand. I don't matter to Delta and neither does my brand loyalty. The employees seemingly aren't allowed to make any changes that aid customers unless they charge them an arm and a leg first due to the company policies. Delta customer support doesn't actually help customers without charging them fees for ridiculous things like flight change despite already having forced customers to pay upwards for $25 dollars extra."
"""Staff very friendly and supportive""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Orlando. Great service. Staff is very friendly and supportive. At first we didn't have a seat assignment. Then as a family with kids received almost entire row in comfort+. Checked carry one and forgot to pull out headsets. Crew gave us free of charge the Delta ones."
"""inconsiderate of customers time""","✅ Trip Verified | I am flying from Dallas to Detroit on a 7.15 am flight. Boarding ran smoothly and upon boarding the entire plane the flight crew mentioned a circuit problem in the cockpit. We were never told what the estimated delay time would be. After an hour of sitting on the plane we were told to deplane. The flight was going to be delayed for an hour and then when boarding time came around another 2 hours. At this point we are 4 hours out from our original departure time. Right as boarding was supposed to begin another hour was added to the delay. This is my first time flying alone. I am 18, unfamiliar with this airport. The pilot told us they checked the circuit at 7.10, when they realized there was an issue, 5 minutes before we were supposed to leave! Why wasn’t this examined prior to boarding an entire plane of people? This is unprofessional and inconsiderate of customers time and money. Not to mention that this was a connecting flight causing issues for many people on the plane to miss their next flight in Atlanta. I still have not boarded, so chances are that the flight will be delayed another hour. Bad service."
"""I seem to always regret it""","✅ Trip Verified | Knoxville to Spokane via Minneapolis . I am not sure why I keep trying to fly Delta. I know this time it was to try to get home a little earlier. I seem to always regret it. This time I gate checked my bag to have it left on the tarmac. When I saw it, the employees would not give it to me saying that they could not give it to us because they didn't ""know"" that it was mine. Never mind that I could identify the bag and its contents!! Instead, we had to leave the terminal and claim it at baggage claim (how do they know it is my bag there when they have ripped off the tag) and then go back through TSA (always fun) to try to make my connection. The last time I flew Delta they wanted my 5 year old son to sit 10 rows away from me. Thanks to a kind fellow travelers, we were able to sit together. Delta simply said ""sorry""."
"""Overall, a perfect flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft Myers to La Guardia. Flew Delta on March 28th in economy. Seat 16C extra leg room seat worth the extra money. Great flight from beginning to end. Boarding was very smooth, upon entering the gate, the gate agent thanked me and used my last name. Upon boarding the plane, crew said ""Welcome, glad to have you aboard!"" Flight took off with no problems, brand new plane. Free snacks and soft drinks during flight. The attendants were super-friendly, polite and professional. They were genuinely happy to be helping us and doing their job. Landed into LaGuardia with no delay, arrived at gate and deplaned with no issues. Overall, a perfect flight. Nice work, Delta!"
"""thank the wonderful stewardesses""","✅ Trip Verified | Cancun to Atlanta. We just wanted to thank the wonderful stewardesses who cared for us on our flight back from Mexico to Atlanta; flight 5238. I am 8 months pregnant, we’d had an awful experience in Mexico and had an extremely short layover to our next flight. They were extremely professional and kind. They cared well for my husband and I!!! They showed us kindness we weren’t expecting and made sure I was feeling well with the pregnancy. And one of them gave me a genuine hug which was more impactful than anything I’d experienced all week. So we just wanted to say thank you and rave about how wonderful they were! Please continue to hire such amazing caretakers."
"""seats in economy were cramped""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew San Francisco to Atlanta. I booked Delta Air Lines with the impression that Atlanta is their headquarters. Their app on iOS is useless. Gate details, seat number were never updated! You have to visit their website to check-in the flight. Cannot be done through app. Make sure that you sign up for alerts. The seats in economy were cramped just like every other airlines. As soon as they turned on the AC, air inside started smelling gas. That alone made me feel like running out of the plane. Flight was delayed by more than 1 hr. Then waited for another hour for takeoff. During the flight, entertainment provided was ok (movies, TV, games) like every other airline. Landing was big problem compared to the other airlines I have travelled (American, Virgin)."
"""nickle and dime you for everything""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Daytona to Philadelphia. Delta Air Lines is the epitome of a greedy corporation. They stuff as many passengers on a plane without regard to their comfort at all. It seems after every terrible flight I fly with Delta, the seats and leg space get smaller and smaller. The crew are unpleasant and seem to hate their jobs more than most hate Delta. They nickle and dime you for everything and even have a scam to try and get people to pay extra for seats they could have for free. They have a ridiculous charge of $75 if you wish to switch to an earlier flight, which is crazy considering the fact that the seats are already available. They claim to have free WiFi on board but it has not worked on a single Delta flight I have been on. Do not fly Delta if you can avoid. The experience is truly terrible and makes me hate traveling."
"""could not recline my seat at all""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Savannah to Denver via Atlanta. I am 5'6' tall, and we flew on the A/B two-seat side of the 767 configured either 2-4-2 or 2-5-2 (don't remember the middle aisle well). Delta now has the seat rows so closely packed that my knees barely cleared the row in front of me. The woman behind me was quite tall. I could not recline my seat at all during the 3 hour flight because she was so crammed in that her knees were jammed right up against my seat back. Too bad Delta isn't making enough money that they need to pack the planes even further."
"""had issues with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Austin to Salt Lake City. I keep giving Delta a chance and they keep screwing me! How many times has Delta left me stranded, exhausted and furious? Let me count the ways! I think collectively at least 6-8 I've had issues with Delta today it was an airplane malfunction where we were deplaned, rerouted and then re-boarded, 6 hours later I'm supposed to be home hours ago for a very important meeting and Delta could care less, they told us they were buying us food which never happened, so after missing 2 connecting flights I ask if I could get a better seat not next to the toilet in the back and they (very defensive attendant) told me there's no upgrades. Give me a break!! I'm never giving my business to Delta again! In fact I have a ticket booked for the future, I will be cancelling and finding an alternative carrier. Delta, not worth the savings. Oh and a brand new plane and my knees were crushed against the front seat!!"
"""decided to dishonor that loyalty""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Jacksonville to Atlanta. After earning a million mile status and retiring on a fixed income Delta Air Lines decided to dishonor that loyalty by flying empty first class seats instead of allowing me to use my Economy fare to upgrade. So now you have to buy an upgraded ticket to upgrade? Jetblue has more legroom and better planes."
""" I will never fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Atlanta. I am a 6-ft, 62 yr old woman with MS and after flying on United to Paris that I would never fly to Europe unless I flew Premium Economy. From ATL to LHR on Virgin was ok, but not as great as the reviews said. However, the flight back on Delta was awful. Seats were so crammed together in Premium Economy that my knees touched the seat in front of me before the passenger put the seat back. Both and and the woman next to me had checked our seats no more than 1 hour before take-off (not boarding) to make sure we were seated next to an empty seat. Both of us were told the site that was the case. Actually, the entire seating chart showed a very sparsely populated cabin. Not the case. It was packed. I believe they tried to make up for the horrible food with sheer volume. There was more really awful food than I'd seen in quite some time, and I will eat anything. The WiFi didn't work. The toilets were not clean. I will never fly Delta again. Worst 8 hours I've ever spent on a plane."
"""the worst airline of all time""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta Air Lines is the worst airline of all time. I cannot believe how they over book their flights and seats that were paid for months ago are now in limbo, that is messed up. I bought 2 tickets with the intent to sit next to my fiance and instead I was placed sitting across the aisle in the middle of two passengers, people I do not know. This type of insecurity and un-reliability is extremely poor. I will never fly again with Delta."
"""did not get my choice of meal""","✅ Trip Verified | Fairly typical flight for Delta and even though it is a regional jet for a 3 hours flight it is not a bad 1st class configuration. Here are some of the good and bad about that flight: The Good: - Staff always nice - Pillow (low quality) and blanket (very good quality) available at each seat. Bottle of water provided - Clean airplane. The Bad: - Announced on time but boarded 20 minutes late (would have preferred to say in lounge an additional 20 minutes instead of standing at gate) - Sitting in the back of 1st Class did not get my choice of meal. I wish I could pre-order like with AA - Online IFE would not load correctly so besides a good selection of movies, I could not watch any (tried multiple browser on a laptop and iPad). Very limited choice of snacks Leg room: Average Recline: Good."
"""care less about the passengers""","✅ Trip Verified | Chattanooga to Newark via Atlanta. The terminal in Chattanooga had two chargers for the whole flight, I left my jacket at a seat and crowded around the charging station with everyone else. I forgot my jacket with house keys and upon arrival at Atlanta half an hour later tried to call into Chattanooga to ask the attendants to pickup the jacket. I asked several attendants and a customer service manager in Atlanta for help, but no one could be bothered, just said to file a report online. Delta never picked up the jacket, or what they did with an old Army coat I will never know. Very disappointed, they could care less about the passengers. I had to replace my house keys and business keys."
"""Delta is deceptive""","✅ Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Wichita via Atlanta. When you see the price that Delta is offering for their flights be aware that this price does not include your seat. I did not know this and I thought I did not need to be on look out for this since I was dealing with Delta. Wrong. I bought 4 tickets and two of them are for my kids. Because of this deception now my kids are going to be sitting with strangers in the middle seats. The cost per leg of our trip to pick our seats is $120 per ticket. The cost to pick our seats would be $960. Flying Delta is like flying on Spirit now. Be careful when you make your reservation, Delta is deceptive."
"""I missed my flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Newark. Very bad experience in Delta Airlines Atlanta. Constant gate changes without notifying passengers. I missed my flight because of the gate change and the attendants treated me horribly. When I tried to ask the attendant a question about the gate change she told me she was too busy. She told me come back in 15 minutes or ask someone else. Horrible customer service and no organization. Ruined my trip."
"""experience has been a nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | Lexington to Atlanta. This experience has been a nightmare for the last week! So called veterans giving misinformation, on-hold and 2 hour call backs are the norm for Delta. After a long wait, disconnected from supervisor with no callback. No, she didn’t hang up due to rudeness. Connection was lost while she was in mid sentence. What has happened to Delta? Right now, their competition does not need to advertise. Delta will run off the loyal long-term customers on their own. Pitiful!"
"""will never fly with them again""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight attendants on the from from Baltimore to Minneapolis on the plane weren’t amazing. But the Delta staff at the service windows in BWIA and MSP is the worst service I have ever dealt with. They were rude, unwilling to help, and late. I will never fly with them again, I would rather pay more to fly any other service."
"""nothing to help remedy the situation""","✅ Trip Verified | Washington to Cancun via Atlanta. I just got back from my vacation to Cancun. Arrived at Hyatt Ziva with five friends and learned that they only had 1 room booked under our reservation when we had booked 3. Delta stated our reservation only had 1 and refused to help. This was even after we demonstrated to the representative that it is impossible to book the Hyatt Ziva with 6 people in one room. The hotel will not even come up as an option on the Delta Vacations website if you put that # of people in one room. The hotel supervisor said that she had not seen this happen in her 15 years working there. It is against hotel policy to book more than 4 to a room. They made a special exception to make sure we weren't sleeping on the street. There was an obvious error on Delta's fault and they did nothing to help remedy the situation. We took turns sleeping on the floor and even outside on the room's balcony. Delta is unwilling to take responsibility."
"""Horrible, horrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Spokane to Anchorage. Horrible, horrible experience. Ruined our day. We now missed the reason for our flight. First they put us on a plane that is broken, nobody thought to inspect the plane before getting everyone on it? Then, after sitting on it about an hour, we are asked to deplane and there was about a hundred people being assisted by two Delta workers. And we were handed a phone number to try to straighten out this mess. No, you created the problem! Why should we have to call? This is customer service? Try Alaska Airlines!"
"""He saved the day""","✅ Trip Verified | La Guardia to Nashville. I had accidentally booked my flight for Tuesday night, meaning to book for Monday. I have no idea how that happened and am almost still convinced it was a computer error. However, after talking to four people who said they were unable to help me, the ""red coat supervisor"" finally changed tickets for my boyfriend and me at no charge. It was an honest mistake of mine and, after 4 days in NYC, we were exhausted and ready to get home. Not to mention both having work the next day and no extra money for an outrageous change fee. He saved the day. A simple act of mercy. Would fly Delta again just because of him."
"""very attentive and caring""","✅ Trip Verified | Charleston to Detroit. Coming back from a short vacation, my husband had a medical emergency. Blood sugar was low, oxygen was low. He was totally out of it. Stewardess saw my distress and called for any medical personnel on board. A nurse came up and another with medical knowledge. Stewardess brought sugar and orange juice. We had to force feed him because he was totally out of it. They went back and got my son and daughter-in-law. All of us crowded in to take care of my husband. Even the pilot came up to talk with us and was checking out the situation. He was going to divert the plane to a nearby airport and had already lowered the altitude. They had an EMS waiting for us at the gate, and they took him directly to a hospital. To sum it up, the attention he got during this medical emergency was second to none. The stewardesses were very attentive and caring."
"""I'll avoid using Delta in future""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Atlanta to Amsterdam. Now I know why the ticket was so cheap. I'll avoid using Delta in future. I knew that US carriers have a bad reputation for quality and service, so I gave them a chance (also other carriers, not just Delta) because of the low price. However, I'll definitely stick with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers in future. The cabin crew were friendlier and more courteous to each other than they were to passengers. When serving food and drink they would have thrown the items at passengers if they could. Service felt rushed and items were dropped onto tray tables, not placed. When serving from the drinks cart, some flight attendants maintained a conversation with each other and didn't even look at passengers when serving - they just looked straight ahead at each other, with their arm held out to the side, waiting for passengers to take the plastic cup from them. That kind of body language is a display of contempt and disdain. Some were more polite than others, but none were in the same league as flight attendants from Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. Unfriendly cabin crew are a common feature among US airline companies. Their boarding process is inefficient. They board by zone number (which is printed on your boarding pass). Your zone is related to how much you paid for your ticket, not the section of the aircraft you're seated in (as it's done on better quality airlines). It would make much more sense to board by row number, starting at the rear to prevent blocking the aisles, as this would reduce waiting times."
"""staff incredible and professional""","✅ Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to Anchorage. Booked a next day flight with 2 kids because my Grandma was in the hospital with only days left. Everything from the call to book the tickets to the seating arrangement to the personal escort on the first flight to the unexpected upgrade in seats, was perfect. The planes were nice with in flight entertainment. The flights themselves were great. The staff on all 3 flights were incredible and professional. We were treated so so good by Delta every step of the way! They made a very difficult situation a little less stressful and my kids loved the staff! 5 stars for Delta!!"
"""I will never use it again""","✅ Trip Verified | Seattle from Hong Kong in May, 2017. One of male flight attendant was very rude, often used his feet to sweep away what on the floor (garbage, blanket, pillows, etc) into my seat. Overall his attitude was not professional at all. My flight to Seattle with Delta, total of about 10hrs long, was stressful because of that one flight attendant guy. It was my first international flight experience using Delta, which turned out to be I will never use it again."
"""Wont be back with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Hartford. I have been waiting a long time to try first class and I was so excited and now I’m so disappointed. I had an okay meal and drinks but North Carolina doesn’t even offer sky lounge which I was looking forward to! The food, drinks, and seating were not good enough for the amount of money it costs. Wont be back with Delta. So disappointing"
"""Parched and miserable!""","✅ Trip Verified | Honolulu to Santa Ana via Seattle. Delayed in Seattle for 5.5 hours and offered no compensation for expenses incurred because of the delay. To make matters worse, they kept telling us we’d be leaving in 45 mins, so many of us didn’t know we could/should make other arrangements. On the flight from Hawaii, we were delayed an hour (stuck on a hot plane). Attendants served water to the front of the plane twice, but didn’t serve economy anything during the delay or at all until 2 hours into the flight. Parched and miserable! Delta, please learn to be professional and check for necessary repairs well before your flight leaves."
"""offensively impolite""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Hartford. Customer service at the gate was lacking to say the least. I waited in line for 25 minutes to ask a question about figuring out my seat assignment as my ticket said to check in at the gate for my assigned seat. Staff stated multiple times that there was “no need to stand in line if you have questions about the flight as I won’t be open to questions about this flight for another 10 minutes”. The flight she was talking about was headed to Florida and was not my flight. I continued to wait patiently as she continued to repeat her statement about not waiting in line for questions. Finally I said to her that I had a question about the next flight out, not the current one. To which she replied, well I don’t know anything about that flight. My response was to ask her if she knew anything about the gate check in seating and how that works as I’ve never encountered that before. And her response was beyond dismissive and rude. She waved her hands on the air saying “how would I know anything about that, just go to customer service” as she walked away from the gate with a line of at least 4 customers behind me. She is an extremely poor representation of Delta and, in my humble opinion, should not be working anywhere with people or customer service. She was offensively impolite, snide, and I was left unhelped in any way. Based on my interaction alone I would not recommend Delta to anyone."
"""cancelled flights and delays""","✅ Trip Verified | Fort Myers to Rochester. We have flown on Delta twice now. Both times we dealt with cancelled flights and delays due to mechanical problems. The people that work for Delta Air Lines were not helpful. We even got yelled at by the person working at the special services desk. There is no compensation either. We were told we would have to stay till the next day but the hotel would be at our cost. Or we could fly to a different city but the rental car to get home would also be our cost. Don't fly with Delta. I would rather walk!"
"""Absolutely the worst flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Phoenix. Absolutely the worst flight. We got on the airplane only to find out there was a leak in the aircraft. We sat on the runway for 2 hours in a freezing cold cabin and not allowed to stand up. The flight attendants were incredibly rude. One was grabbing something from the overhead compartment and dropped a suitcase on my head. She didn’t even apologize! Passengers around me were asking if I was ok and the flight attendant just walked away. Delta should do a better job with hiring and reviewing all of their aircraft before departure."
"""2 months ago with no response""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Atlanta to San José delayed 1 hour, sat in plane after being rushed to board. Luggage then took 1.5 hours to show up on turnstile. Wrote to Delta customer service 2 months ago with no response. Also submitted lost item report and no response to that either. Everytime I call reservation line it takes 2 hours to get call back."
"""staff were courteous and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | Our flight from Minneapolis to Palm Springs on Delta was very pleasant. We were delayed for about an hour on our outbound flight due to an equipment delay on the inbound flight that was delayed because of weather. The gate agent kept us informed regularly and once the plane was at the gate, they very quickly cleaned the plane and had us board in a quick and orderly fashion. The plane was a newer one and had the monitors which were terrific for watching movies. They had a huge selection of old and really new movies. The flight went by very quickly for all of us. The return flight was on time and went just fine. The staff were courteous and helpful every step of the way."
"""They would not even work with me""","✅ Trip Verified | vFt Lauderdale to Oklahoma City via Atlanta. I had a family issue and had Military travel book my ticket for me. I called Delta today to see if I could reschedule the ticket due to the family issues changing a little; expecting to pay a penalty or transfer fee. Instead I was told I would have to just eat that money and no money would be applied to any other use with Delta. They would not even work with me on this. I have booked several tickets before and have spent $$$$$ with delta. I have never been told I would end up having to eat 100% of the money I bought this ticket with."
"""Delta are not respecting their customers""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew New York City to Washington, D.C. . What a poor airline! First of all, even if you are Gold Member of Flying Blue you cannot have access to the Delta lounge at JFK Terminal 4, because you are flying on domestic route. What is this policy? It is not written in any place of their lounge? Also United and Air France are not working like that. Thank you Delta Air Lines for taking care of your customers. Secondly, flight has been delayed 2h30 for a flight duration of 45min. No excuse from Delta Airlines. Incredible how Delta are not respecting their customers, and especially their Gold Member Flying Blue customers."
"""Shame on them""","✅ Trip Verified | . Orlando to Wilkes-Barre via Atlanta. I've requested two call backs 2 days before my flight, when the ticket price was affordable to change flight days. I've never received one call back, and called the next morning when the flight was $300 more. I could have flown home to an emergency (they even asked for the hospitals name and number to verify, who does that?! But I wasn't lying, so I obliged. So not only am I missing a major medical family event- their mistake of not calling back as requested seemed to be strategically planned on their behalf. Why would they call back when they could make $300 more in few hours?! Shame on them."
"""does not care about their customers""","✅ Trip Verified | Delta does not care about their customers and will say whatever they can to get you out of their hair. On a flight going from Detroit to Sault Ste. Marie that was delayed due to weather Delta kept stringing all the passengers along that they were trying to get another flight to go to Sault in the early morning of the next day. They gave us a coupon for a hotel since we all had to stay the night, but the coupon was only $1 off the regular price. When I followed up the next morning their helpline informed me that a request for an additional flight was never even submitted. They didn’t even try to get people there in a timely manner and instead are making people wait to (hopefully) get in around midnight the next day. This is over a full 24 hrs that we have been stuck in the airport loosing money since we have to take additional days off work now and spending more since we had to get a hotel and meals on our own dime. I would recommend to never flying with Delta unless you enjoy being given the run around."
"""will not fly Delta ever again after this""","✅ Trip Verified | Having traveled on international carriers and then domestic ones, I have to admit my expectations of domestic airlines are pretty low already. Delta was beyond belief this past weekend. I was already annoyed that I had a connecting flight, so I booked an early in order to make an appointment in San Diego, CA. My outbound flight to MSP was delayed so much that I missed the connecting flight to SAN. Once I arrived in MSP, I was directed to the service desk for assistance. The Service Desk agent displayed absolutely no empathy and told me my next flight out was going to be with an additional connection through LAX. So I was originally going to get to SAN around 1pm. Now with the delays and re-route this was going to push me back to 9pm. I asked at the service desk if they compensate their customers in any way and she said ""Well, if you were here more than 8 hours we would give you a meal voucher and Delta feels if they get you there within 24 hours then that is the best they can do."" Her words, not mine. I was floored. So I asked her to terminate my trip in LAX and I would get my own transportation from there to SAN instead of sitting in the airport another two hours. I get to LAX and no bag! I ran like a mad woman to baggage services so that they could keep my bag from going on the connecting flight to SAN. The agent there was emotionless as he put a note in the computer and he told me to wait 20 minutes until they respond. I said ""Uhm, can you call them please? I would like to get my bag and leave."" He said ""ok."" I mean why do I have to instruct you on how to extend good customer service? He called and my bag was produced within the next few minutes. I tried to purchase a ticket on another carrier for my return flight home in a couple of days, but they were just too expensive. But I can guarantee, I will not fly Delta ever again after this. It seems like the airlines, Delta, American, and United included only treat you with a small sense of dignity when you have status within their frequent flyer program. So sad, but true."
"""needs to do better and improve on delays""","✅ Trip Verified | Sacramento to Gulfport. It’s 2018 and it’s been years since I flown with Delta Air Lines just because I don’t really like flying with the airline. I decided to give them another try and just like I thought they would do delay the flights and push the time back constantly which is annoying because it never fails that’s why I will be sticking to American Airlines. Delta needs to do better and improve on delays."
"""fine except the baggage overcharging""","✅ Trip Verified | The flight from New York City to San Juan in my opinion was generally good. No delays, good service by the flight attendants and a reasonable price one way 98 USD. The problem was the overpricing of the baggage. PR got devastated by a monster hurricane Maria and my family needed a generator and my sister did the same route and same airline and payed 25 dollars for the same generator. I left 2 weeks later (October 29th 2017) and paid 70 dollars for it. In general Delta is fine except the baggage overcharging in a emergency situation in PR."
"""all ruined by incompetence""","✅ Trip Verified | As I write this, I am spending the night in the Salt Lake City airport. My flight into SLC was delayed just long enough to miss my connection to my home town, for the fourth time in a row. As usual, the only options Delta suggested required me to pay out of pocket, for a hotel or rental car. Somehow, no matter what the cause of my missed flight is, they have exempted themselves from offering any sort of compensation (“Oh, we can’t do anything about that.”) This time they did change my flight to a nearby city, but with no way of making it home from there. It kind of seems like an attempt to look like they are trying to help while actually being the opposite of helpful, unless stranding me with no way home is considered helpful. Unfortunately, my employer books exclusively through Delta, so I will likely go through this again. SLC plays loud piano music all night, with regular security announcements. I guess they want to make sure no one stranded at their airport overnight has the chance to get a little sleep. Four trips in a row that were pretty enjoyable until the last little bit, then it’s all ruined by incompetence."
"""They were doing everything they could""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Delta Air Lines from Kansas City to Atlanta. On Monday while flying I abruptly got sick and I just wanted to thank the flight attendants on board for taking such good care of me. They were doing everything they could to try to help me not feel as miserable and I want to say kudos for having such caring team members."
"""so impressed with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Orlando. I'm so impressed with Delta. I flew to FL 18 years ago on a different airline and vowed to never fly again. All in all I never enjoyed flying it was just a means to a destination. I made a snap decision to travel with family to see family, tickets bought no backing out. It was a beautiful flight so much so i spent a lot of time looking out the window watching the flight navigator on the seat back so i knew exactly what city were were flying over. We were all seated together on a fully packed flight as well which was a bonus! Although we were in Economy we were treated with the same respect as first class! The Pilot was great, flight attendants were great, snacks were just right. The plane itself was stunning to see inside and out. Spacious, clean, plenty of leg room with free in flight movies, games and much more on every seat back. Headphones were not included but only $2 to purchase. Usually after flying i made myself forget the flight! Now i'm actually looking forward to flying with Delta again! Thank you Delta for a wonderful (non-terrifying) much needed family vacation! I'll be back!"
"""I had a good flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Delta from Los Angeles to Honolulu. Considering the fact that these aircraft offer the stingiest amount of leg room in the first class cabin and the catering is minimal, I had a good flight. It left on time, arrived early and the cabin crew tried very hard to provide wonderful service with the bare minimum they were given to work with. Incredibly as I reached baggage claim my bag appeared. Considering the five hour flight time,the seat was acceptable enough and the catering merely surprising. Everything else was top notch."
"""Just so disappointing""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew over for my Mother's 85th birthday and though we'd try Delta as they fly directly from the UK to the States. We paid higher than the ""going rate"" for our flight especially because we wanted a smooth overnight return so that we could return to work the day after return. The flight over was very good, we were impressed. But, our connection from Richmond to our NY overseas flight was suddenly cancelled. The ground crew hardly knew how to cope with such. They claimed it much be weather, though had no idea. As their flights to other NY airports were flying, and the weather report looked fine this could not be the case. After much back and forth we were routed through Atlanta (still suffering from the hurricanes) and then Amsterdam. This was the longest return we'd ever experienced in our 30 years of regular travel between the UK/US. Needless to say we could not return to work the following day as planned. So initially we were very disappointed at how poorly Delta handled our return. We can only assume that the flight was cancelled because they hadn't the numbers, and thus the profit. This was the first clue of a problem. The confused and almost useless ground staff the second clue. Note that we had to work with them for a realistic return as their initial proposal did not allow adequate lay-over time in Atlanta given the airport size. Then on return I wrote a complaint to Delta. Next clue was that complaints are automated through a soulless computer process. Then I was warned that they were experiencing a high volume to customer service requests and while they hoped to answer in 30 days they could not promise. 30+ days, seriously? Well they passed our complaint, about Delta's handling of our custom, over the KLM who few the transatlantic flight. They must never had even read the complaint. Since then we've had two emails from KLM about how they are too busy to reply but will soon. So now it is almost 4 months after a complaint and nothing. Just so disappointing. Will never fly Delta again if this is what happens when there's a problem."
"""overall experience is not bad""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to New York JFK. Delta One is decent as a transcontinental business product. On the Boeing 767-300 it is a 1-2-1 staggered layout. However, the shell of each seat is way too short, creating a less private experience. The catering service was great. Three entree options were provided and were accompanied by an appetizer, a salad, a soup, and some deserts afterwards. Delta uses Westin's Heavenly bedding onboard all of their Delta One flights which was very comfortable. However, the poor design of the seat caused the situation where there was no room for my feet to move when the seat is in its lie-flat position. The flight crew was very friendly. Onboard Wi-Fi was useable but extremely slow. The overall experience of this flight is not bad and I would definitely fly Delta One for transcontinental flights if good pricing is available."
"""Delta Comfort+ is very good""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Boston to Raleigh Durham with Delta on a CRJ 900 return. Outbound flight left on time arrived early. On my return heavy snow was forecast so l changed to a flight 3 hours earlier at no cost. Luckily l did as airport closed not long after we departed. Travelled in Delta Comfort+ which is very good. Only 2 of us in this area on return leg. Coffee and snack served. Flight and ground staff excellent."
"""Customer service is terrible""","✅ Trip Verified | This is by far the worst airline, after traveling from Ft Lauderdale to Kentucky via Atlanta having two flights cancelled the third delayed 4 times I arrived. On my return trip I booked a 7.00am through Atlanta. Arrived in Atlanta, the plane has zero entertainment available we sat on the runway for 25 mins only to be told we have to go back to the gate for a maintenance issue. It is incredible how bad an airline can become in a matter of a year. Customer service is terrible, I will do everything I can to avoid flying this airline again. This is a sad time that an airline can be so poor in the service to their customers."
"""in Guatemala with no luggage""","✅ Trip Verified | Our flight was originally from Calgary stopping at Minneapolis then Atlanta to Guatemala but my Atlanta flight was delayed to the point of us missing our flight to Guatemala. We had to rebook to catch a flight to Salt Lake City then to LA then to Guatemala, when went to a help desk to get our flights changed we asked to have our luggage changed with us and that request was ignored! A very simple request and now we are in Guatemala with no luggage. We need our stuff and I think the baggage people need to take their job more seriously and pay attention to notes on bags and such!"
"""seats make all the difference""","✅ Trip Verified | Honolulu to Los Angeles. Had a near perfect experience on this internationally configured aircraft. From the Delta Club to baggage claim. Lie flat seats, friendly efficient crew, great entertainment, decent food and early arrival made this a great experience. This one daily flight with this aircraft is the one to take as the seats make all the difference."
"""avoid this airline if you can""","✅ Trip Verified | Washington to Las Vegas via Detroit. My flight was schedule to leave Washington DC at 12:45PM so that I could catch a connecting flight to Vegas at 3:45PM. Around 11:30AM, they announced that the flight got 1 hour delay and would arrive at Detroit approximately at 3:20PM. I told myself that it would leave me roughly 20 mins to run from one gate to the other gate. I accepted my fate and kept on waiting. Then, they boarded us. As soon as we sat down on the plane, we got another notification that the flight wouldn’t leave until 4:20PM, so they deplaned us and told us to check with the customer service desk for assistance. I went there and they put on another flight that would arrive in Vegas at 8PM local time. There was nothing else they could do, they said. Now I’m sitting here waiting to board still. I’ve been waiting since 10AM - avoid this airline if you can."
"""Planes are clean and updated""","✅ Trip Verified | I love flying Delta Air Lines. Planes are clean and updated. Charger and entertainment at every seat. Offered headphones if we didn’t have them. Attendant professional and courteous. I have flown 4 different airlines in the last month and Delta has been my favorite. Seats are spacious and comfortable."
"""rude, uncaring behavior""","✅ Trip Verified | Fayetteville to Atlanta. Our flight was delayed for the amount of time it would have taken to get to our destination, risking us to miss our connection flight. We were parked on the runway for an hour. The flight attendant was obnoxious & rude. Prior to the flight, she went up & down the aisle multiple times counting the number of passengers. Even while more passengers were still arriving on the plane & waiting to get seated. She was discouraging & asking why people were arriving on the plane so late. She tried to push a customer to grab his seat immediately for take off, but was blocked by others placing their carryon baggage in the bins. He had no choice but to wait. She announced the flight delay on the intercom & said we would take off in 10 min. 10 min later, she announced the same exact thing with the same amount of time. During flight as she was passing out snacks & beverages, she purposely walked pass my aisle with my brother without offering goods & commented, ""Oh, you didn't say anything so I assumed you didn't want anything."" As a flight attendant, you are obligated to accomodate your passengers by asking about their needs & promoting their offers first hand. Overall she just had rude, uncaring behavior."
"""have just run out of care""","✅ Trip Verified | I completely understand we had this horrible snow storm 2 weeks ago (I am in FL and it snowed here) so I get it that delays were caused. I'm not complaining about our flight being rebooked, or anything else weather related. I am complaining because I spoke with and saw a number of Delta representatives, all of which were told we were traveling with infants and none of them printed infant tickets causing us to be seconds away from missing our flight sucks. Our luggage was lost in JFK (I say lost because no one could tell me where it was) and the average wait to get luggage was 1.5-2 hours and we had to wait 4. Our items were damaged and missing the Delta representatives are clearly sick of speaking with customers because they are all extremely rude and have just run out of care to give to their customers. So Delta you clearly owe your reps some lunch or a bonus or something because they are making matters so much worse by just not caring. Now I have filled a claim online for my damaged items however the website would only accept one upload, so I have no idea if you got the picture of the damaged personal items, luggage, or car seat but I'll be more than happy to go over all the information with someone in the estimated 6-8 weeks I was told it would take for a Delta claim member to follow up."
"""not able to get the necessary information""","✅ Trip Verified | I choose Delta Air Lines as it was the only airline flying direct to Cleveland from New York, all the others had a stop over which was not convenient. I was coming in internationally from Cairo, Egypt and had a transit time of 3.5 hours. After a 12 hour flight I was not notified that my flight had been canceled. JFK airport wifi is not very good so I was not able to get the necessary information. I claimed my luggage and went to the check in desk and to my surprise they had canceled and rebooked me for next day, it was very urgent that I fly out. Delta did not assist me with any hotel booking, I booked and paid for one for myself and being a first class passenger I was extreamly disappointed. Now we are trying to change tickets online and due to the restrictions on my ticket I am unable to do so online, furthermore their hotline is hopeless giving you a wait time of 2 hours call back and they don't call back!"
"""the worst experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh Durham to Seattle via Atlanta. My initial flight was from RDU to SEA on 01/08/18 early morning reaching SEA at 9:30am. Then Delta had a scheduled flight change and the arrival time in SEA got changed to 10:20am. I had an important meeting to attend at noon on 01/08 so I requested Delta to put me on a flight on 01/07 night instead which they did. My new flight was from RDU to SEA via ATL with a stopover of 45 minutes. The flight from RDU to ATL got delayed by 15 minutes. The RDU ATL flight arrived at gate B18 and the ATL SEA flight was from gate E6. Why would they even suggest such an itinerary with 45 minutes of stopover. I ran my heart out and reached gate E6 10 minutes before departure but the door had already closed. There were plenty of other passengers with me. Could they not have waited for 10 more minutes? Was it so difficult to see that there are other people connecting to this flight who had landed just 10 minutes before, more so given the fact that the flight was the last flight for the night to SEA from ATL? After that, I got rebooked on a flight to SEA via SLC reaching SEA at 12:30pm on 01/08. So basically the reason why I prepone my flight to 01/07 in order to reach on time for my meeting, you are now taking me to SEA even after my original direct flight from RDU to SEA. I told the gate agent about that and she was outright rude. I said I have to attend the meeting and I will take a non delta flight and reach SEA on time for my meeting. She told me that I wont get any refund since I am already rebooked on a different flight. So basically I ended up spending the whole night in ATL, waiting 4 hours in the terminal to get my bag out, and then ended up taking a 6:15am Alaska flight to SEA. I would never ever travel on Delta again. This was the worst experience I ever had and the gate agents and customer support is no good and outright rude."
"""last time I fly with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Atlanta. Delta lost my bag on my way to New York. When I created the mishandled baggage claim for the item, I was told that it would arrive at JFK at 9 that night, Friday, January 5th, and be sent to our hotel immediately so we would have the bag by the next morning at the latest. By Sunday, our bag hadn't arrived and we had spent four plus hours on hold collectively. We arrived at the airport for our return trip, hoping to collect our bag there and depart. At one terminal, we were given the exact location of the bag and when we arrived there, were asked to wait for over an hour to get the location of the bag, which I already had. There were hundreds of bags misplaced and Delta was very inneffective at fixing the issue and almost made us late for our return flight, which was subsequently delayed by an hour, thirty minutes of which we spent sitting on the runway. This is the last time I fly with Delta or use the JFK airport."
"""dissatisfied with my experience ""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Syracuse. I'm extremely dissatisfied with my experience with Delta. After arriving at San Diego International Airport at 430am for my 7am departure our flight was delayed over and hour. This delay was not due to weather. We landed at JFK Airport and we waited well over a half hour to even get off to a gate to de-board. This caused me to miss my layover to Syracuse, NY. Although Delta did pay for the next flight out to Syracuse, NY via Delta airlines, this turned into a 4 hour layover. Now that we are finally ready to depart from JFK and finally on my way home after an exhausting day of unexpected travel, we are again delayed not due to weather but waiting an another plan to land so other customers can make this connecting flight. We were supposed to depart at 856 and it's been 40 minutes. Yes, I'm frustrated but also upset due to the inconsistency of the airline - why couldn't my Delta connection wait for all the passengers from JFK to Syracuse instead of leaving right at that moment."
"""no care, kindness or sympathy""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to London. Got here at 5pm for our 8pm flight yesterday, endured 5hrs of gate changing and ridiculous excuses and lies. No available gate, waiting for Egyptair to finish. Prepping said plane, then more gate hopping for several hours. Back to waiting for Egyptair to get off. Waiting for cabin crew to prep - no cabin crew as they’ve finished their shift and we have to wait for the next cabin crew at unknown time of arrival Boarded a few people, then made them come off the plane as it was “too cold” as the engine had no fuel! Pilot didn’t even know how long it’d take. We have all collectively concluded that none of this was true and later found out that flights to London never take off from the gates we were made to hopscotch between. Then on the 7th hour at 2am we were told that the next flight was at 6:30PM. Queued for 3hrs just to ask a question which took us to 5am. With 13hrs wait time ahead of us, we were unable to leave and with zero facilities here, no shops open, no hotel rooms nearby, rude useless staff who kicked sleeping mothers and children out of airline lounges. Overheated space with nowhere to sit, no water offered and no care to those with young children. I saw so many dismissed and sent away from the airport without any care. Absolutely disgusted by all this. Only this morning they took the initiative to give out some drinks and muffins to those with newly delayed flights. Clearly the media’s hitting hard but what about the rest of us who endured 12hrs last night, held hostage and treated like cattle in dirt with no food or bedding? Utterly disgusting and to top it all off, my sister just asked for a pillow from a Delta employee and her rude response was “I was handing them out at 2 last night, they’re all gone, what do you want me to do about it?” No care, no kindness, no sympathy - just a mockery of what we’re having to go through."
"""Horrible customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew from New York to Las Vegas and back, both times were horrible experiences. First the airplane was super old and extremely dirty. We had checked a bag and there was only one rep. Second trip was even worse, will try to avoid them. Horrible customer service. They had switched my seats around. Right after purchase they extended the lay-over time and charged me to check in a carry on bag."
"""will try to avoid using Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Savannah. Delta has no sense of customer service at all. I purchased 5 first class tickets from Georgia to Colorado with a connection in Atlanta. Circumstances led my sister to need to fly out of Atlanta and return in Atlanta. (We knew we were losing the extra money for her Savannah flights but she was keeping her same seat on her Atlanta flights) I waited on hold for three hours to let Delta know she will no longer need the flights I paid for from Savannah to Atlanta and from Atlanta to Savannah. I was then informed it would cost an additional $448 to allow her to check in in Atlanta. As a result, she drove 3.5 hours to Savannah to make the Savannah flight. The day before the flight, I tried to check all of us in; however, my sister was no longer on the itinerary anywhere. So i waited an additional 1.5 hours to see why she was no longer on the itinerary. Turns out the delta rep who tried to change her flight information gave her a different itinerary number. To compensate, Delta gave us a $100 voucher to use to purchase any delta tickets. On the flight home she did not board as she needed to stay in Atlanta. So I allowed my nephew to sit in her seat that I already paid for. Deltas employees then made him get up and go to his assigned seat in the main cabin so one of their pilots could sit in the first class seat I paid for! Very unfortunate that Deltas employees choose to make sure they are comfortable rather than the paying customers. Extremely disappointed in this airline. I will not be recommending this airline and will try to avoid using Delta for future flights."
"""Delayed both of my flights""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Norfolk. Delayed both of my flights one by 45 mins, the other by 1.5 hours because they didn't consider that a plane would need to be deiced in December flying through the Midwest or east coast - they delayed it 3 different times. Each flight they didn't tell me the 3rd time it got delayed, I found out at the airport. The first flight they didn't say anything at all at the counter I had to find it on a TV after we hadn't started boarding when we were supposed to, customer service is rude, they don't care about their customers, the boarding agents are angry and aggressive. Miserable experience and will never fly with them again"
"""Delta would not help me that day""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Calgary via Montreal. I showed up late for my flight but I was still an hour in advance. A nice Delta employee tried to check me in anyway but then later she said they can't open the gates since flight is sold out and she said I must call WestJet. I called WestJet, on hold etc back and forth with them, to make a long story short they told me I must re-book with Delta who again (different person) they cannot help me and I must call WestJet. Out of frustration I left the airport since I wasn't getting anywhere and it had been 2 hours of trying to book another flight. I later booked with Expedia out of desperation since I needed to get back home to Calgary and flew out the next day same flight same airline (Westjet operated by Delta). No one will compensate me. I'm very disappointed that Delta would not help me that day."
"""it was an absolute mess""","✅ Trip Verified | For this transcontinental flight from Seattle to New York, we decided to try Delta and booked its Delta Comfort+ Seat. When we arrived at the airport, it was an absolute mess with little staff and loads of people trying to check in and get through security. It was unclear what we were supposed to do and we waited for a long time before realising that we were supposed to use the e-kiosk for check in. Boarding was also an absolute mess with no clear line or anything. It took ages to board as people were blocking the aisles. After we settled in, it was a pretty comfortable ride to New York and we arrived early. The IFE has really a lot of content and was more than enough for the journey. The rest of the journey was smooth, except that we had to walk 15 minutes to collect our bags."
"""Would fly Delta again""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Phoenix. We had a separate ticket having landed in LAX and had 4 hours in transit in order to check-in for our flight. Ground staff really helpful and friendly (LAX is not well signed). Checked-in a relaxed manner due to great staff. Unfortunately flight delayed by 90 mins - hence a mark down; saying that we were well informed all the time, so credit to Delta. Boarding and flight was fine and efficient when it happened - end of the day only a one hour filght (and one hour delay). Despite delay, us and luggage well taken care of. Would fly Delta again."
"""Delta did a very good job""","✅ Trip Verified | Bangor to Raleigh Durham via La Guardia, Originally scheduled to fly Westjet/Delta code share flights YFC to RDU but snow on Christmas Day caused flight cancellations. Process of rescheduling was somewhat stressful. Westjet and Delta staff were helpful but their systems do not interact well. Worked with Westjet gate attendant then followed that with calls to Delta, Westjet and finally Delta again to sort out a flight change for the next day for a Bangor to RDU routing. Flight out of Bangor was delayed. Gate agent at Bangor was greeting passengers as they reached the gate area, offering snacks, pre-checking bags, thanking everyone for flying Delta. He was also proactive in assisting those who needed help with wheelchairs or pre-boarding. Flight BGR-LGA was okay - crew efficient and professional. Connection in LGA went okay, flight to RDU boarded a bit early but pilot came on the PA and sounded very frustrated as he advised us of a last minute route change from Air Traffic Control. This caused a slight delay in take off. Flight was okay as well though very unusual - we flew very low (about 5,000 feet according to Flight Tracker) for most of the route. This made the trip a bit longer than scheduled but the pilot kept us informed so not a big issue. Flight attendants also efficient and professional. Considering the challenges of flying out of the US Northeast due to the Christmas weather, Delta did a very good job."
"""not able to choose our seats""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Atlanta. The flight departed and arrived on time and the staff were pleasant. We really didn't like that we were not able to choose our seats. We had to check in at the airport, using a machine, which allocated our seats. As we were right at the back of the plane, we were not particularly surprised to find that there was no choice left for us when the first meal was served. However, when it happened again on the second meal, I have to say that I was pretty annoyed. They had also completely run out of the icecream and there was no excuse for just not having enough of something that was not a choice. I cannot understand why, having disappointed us the first meal, they could not have served us first on the second meal, the kitchen was directly behind us and they had to pass us to start serving from the front again. We ended up having nothing at all to eat and my husband was ravenous. The meal we had the first time was pretty poor too, I mostly ate the cheese and biscuits."
"""Do not trust this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte to Minneapolis. Delta has failed to get me to my destination in a comfortable and timely fashion every time I have flown with them. The most recent fiasco was my flight from Charlotte to Albuquerque. Less than an hour after taking off, the captain comes over the speaker to tell us that the cabin pressure system had malfunctioned and to remain safe we had to stay at 10k feet and divert to Cincinnati. We were informed that we all had to deplane and was told it would be a few minutes. After a half hour of no information, I finally talked to the customer service. They informed me that it was going to be another hour. The hour passes then it's two hours. Then three. I talk to customer service to see what I could do about missing my connection. I was given 3 options; have a six and a half layover to wait for the next plane, fly back to Charlotte and try again in three days, or give up and get a flight on a more reliable airline. On top of this awful situation, in the past I have been snapped at by customer service, delayed four and a half hours because a kid puked in the aisle, ignored by chatting FA, and left stranded in another country for 18 hours. Do not trust this airline to get you anywhere in a safe or timely manner."
"""Overall a pleasant experience""","✅ Trip Verified | New York La Guardia to Tampa on Delta Air Lines. Checked in on line and proceeded straight to the gate as I only had carry-on luggage. About 3 hours before the flight got notified of a 35 minute delay. Once at the gate, the flight got pushed out by another hour and eventually we were moved to another gate for departure. Boarding was delayed yet another 30 minutes but was conducted by zone and in an orderly manner. Onboard the seat was comfortable and having purchased an exit row seat, I had ample leg room. The service was prompt and we were offered drinks and a choice of 4 snacks. The FA were efficient but lacked warmth. The flight eventually departed with a 3 hour delay and was late arriving after in Tampa. We were briefed on the nature of delays which were not directly the fault of the airline and most were the result of the supremely inefficient LGA. Overall a pleasant experience for a domestic flight in economy."
"""Christmas night alone in a hotel room""","✅ Trip Verified | Due to fly Portland to Orange County via Seattle. Flight delayed in Seattle, so they reserved me a backed up Alaskan Airlines flight. Not only was this 'reserved' back up not confirmed, but I arrived to late to catch it anyway. Now to spend Christmas night alone in a hotel room I hadn't expected to pay for. Merry Christmas Delta Air Lines, thanks for ruining my holidays."
"""missed the connection in SLC""","✅ Trip Verified | Portland to Salt Lake City. So, over the night we had 1 inch of snow in Portland and our flight was scheduled for 6:00AM. We get to the airport and see that the check in supposed to start at 5:20AM starts at 5:40AM. We get jn the plane, it was already over 6:00AM and people were still finding their seats. I have to mention that our connecting flight in SLC was 30 minutes away from the PDX flight landing. This combo of flights was offered by the company I did not choose it specifically. Temperature outside was about 40 degrees no snowing, no raining and they had to deice the plane. Only that they started doing it at 6:15AM. Again, Our departure was scheduled at 6:00AM they start deicing at 6:15. Great customer service, especially after we got stuck on the tarmac for another hour so our plane ended up taking off at 7:15AM. We missed the connection in SLC. I go to the counter lady who of course told us that she will rebook us the second day. I said fine, so who is gonna cover our hotel and expenses? She said we do not cover that type of stuff when a delay is because of the weather? And here I give up, when you were already late with the boarding you act incompetent and start to deice the plane with 15 minutes after the departure time, when outside is clear sky and 40 degrees? When I brought up all these arguments to her she did not know what excuse to find and she said that she will not cover our expenses and she is the boss so I cannot talk with anybody else. So after showing a huge level of incompetency to your clients that paid for your tickets, you do not even try to make it up to them? Weather related means the weather stopped you from flying in time, not you having some ice on the airplane while the skies are clear since hours ago and you did not take the time to clean it."
"""Delta was so understanding""","❎ Not Verified | Duluth to Boston. Thank You Delta Air Lines - Merry Christmas! I made a terrible mistake in booking our flight and as a result we missed our flight by an entire day! Don’t ask, horrible mistake! Delta was so understanding and put us in another flight today without even batting an eye! Thank you Delta Air Lines for providing excellent customer service! We so appreciate you."
"""Horrible service every single time""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew from Boston to Amsterdam. This is the most ridiculous airline out there. I have never had an issue with any other airline except Delta. I have been waiting for a flight for 4 hours, supposedly waiting for the flight to come from one terminal to another. Doesn’t seem likely that this would take 4 hours. Horrible service every single time. No one knows what is going on ever. Haven’t flown with delta for 4 years because of how horrible they are every single time and I don’t intend to ever again. If you want a smooth flight, do not ever take Delta. They are most unreliable airline out there."
"""miserable experience with Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | We have had a miserable experience with Delta. We booked our flight the morning of Christmas Eve due to work schedules out of california to sunny Las Vegas. The day before our flight we were so excited to know that next morning we would be spending our Christmas Eve with my family. Unfortunately for us our plans changed quickly for the worst. At 7:30 pm we got a text saying our flight was cancelled, my husbands flight got rebooked to get into Las Vegas late Christmas Eve and my flight wasn’t rebooked to get in Christmas Day. We didn’t panic because we thought we would have enough time to resolve this issue. However we got stuck on hold with Delta for 3.5 hours. By that time we decided this is a joke and if we’re going to beat holiday traffic Christmas Eve we better get going even if that meant we wouldn’t get to our destination until 3:00 am. We were already on vacation so we had to extend our rental another day and pay for gas in an SUV to get to Vegas. By the time we were an hour into our drive delta finally answered only to tell us that our flight was cancelled due to weather and that there was nothing they could do to make this situation right. It’s unfortunate because the weather was perfect out of California and Las Vegas. We will not be relying on Delta to handle our travel plans in the future."
"""underwhelming standard of service""","✅ Trip Verified | Dublin to New York. Early am efficient check in at Dublin similar for pre clearance prior to boarding. The lounge after clearance is far superior to the DATA lounges in both T1 & T2 in Dublin. Boarded the rather ageing aircraft with 40 rather cramped seats. Had to ask for a welcome drink, this set the scene for what was to be an underwhelming standard of service throughout the flight. They ran out of the beef entree along with the French red. Champagne was closeted away, the sauce with the chicken was far too salty for my liking. Amenity kit which is touted is very basic does not have a comb, however in its defense it does contain a generic hand sanitizer in gel form however would have been better had this been Purell. Marks out of 10 would be a six plus average in terms of comfort. Service was lackluster and not personable on this six hour flight. Let's see what my Feb 5th return flight can improve anything, although I am not holding my breath."
"""the seating was horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | San Antonio to Columbia via Atlanta. Check - In at SAT was completed quickly, despite the long line. The Ticket Agents were very kind and helpful. Boarding process went smooth. Flew on a B737-900ER for first leg of my trip .The flight itself was very cramped. im 5""0 tall and didnt feel like I had enough legroom. I did appreciate the free IFE, lots of free movies and TV shows to select from as well as plenty of beverages. The flight attendants were attentive for the most part, the pilot kept us updated with weather, any upcoming turbulence, wind speeds and time. The flight was very quiet and smooth. The 2nd leg of my trip trip was on a CRJ900 I was pre-selected for a window exit seat (since i flew basic economy) im glad the flight was only 45 min. because the seating was horrible no recline, very small plane so people would bump into your shoulder in the aisle, I also had to share the same armrest with the passenger next to me, the plane was very old and seemed worn out seat cushions were lifting up and partially torn. Not settling for a nervous flyer. I would fly Delta again but its not going to be my first choice of airline."
"""excellent customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Buffalo to Atlanta. Due to the power outage in Atlanta my flight from Buffalo was delayed and then canceled. Then my next day flight was also canceled. The staff at gate 25 were absolutely wonderful answering questions and working like crazy to get everybody on the next available flight with connections that worked for them. They were efficient and more than polite. The level of concern they showed and their willingness to bend over backwards to accommodate the passengers was incredible. They worked quickly but took time to explain questions asked and not make us feel rushed through. I was traveling alone and not being an experienced traveler, I was extremely nervous. But the young lady really made the inconvenience much less scary and went out of her way to show us step by step what was about to happen. Thank you Delta for your excellent customer service and taking care of your passengers. You really made the best of an unforeseeable event and showed me how important your reputation is to your employees."
"""will look elsewhere to give our business""","✅ Trip Verified | Miami to La Guardia. We use Delta to travel for all of our vacations, today December 15th flight 2820 seemed to be the only flight delayed flying into New York. Onboard, the older FA had no personality to be a rep for customer service for Delta. She was so rude from the minute we stepped foot onto the plane looking everyone up and down and making faces. While waiting to get to the gate at a complete standstill, while sitting right next to the bathrooms, instead of speaking one on one to us, she made an announcement very rudely as my boyfriend walked into the bathroom that we were holding up the flight. If there is one thing that makes a flight, it is the flight attendants personality, and for her attitude alone, my boyfriend and I will look elsewhere to give our business."
"""Worst airline experience""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Winnipeg via Minneapolis. Worst airline experience I ever had! I've been flying for 20hrs and expecting to arrive on my last destination on time so I can have some good sleep. I flew from the Philippines to Korea for 4.5 hours, then Korea to JFK (New York) for 14hrs, JFK to Minneapolis for 3.5hrs and scheduled on my last flight from Minneapolis to Winnipeg, Canada at 8:15PM the same day. Our flight from JFK got delayed and we arrived in Minneapolis around 8:30PM already and missed my connecting flight to Winnipeg. Staff told me that my next flight has been rescheduled on the following day Dec 10 at 9AM. I explained to them that I've been flying straight for 20hrs now and I need some good sleep. Airline staff only gave me an answer that they cannot provide me a hotel. According to them the cause of the delay its because of the weather issues. I understand that de-icing is all about the weather issues but its clear that there are also mechanical problem."
"""Globally, just a great airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Globally, just a great airline. Delta Air Lines improvement is spectacular when comparing it to 10 years ago. The out-bound flight (BRU-JFK) was delayed 40 min but we were properly informed well in advanced. Unfortunately, the in-bound flight (JFK-BRU) was delayed as well, initially of 1h40 but informed when we had already boarded. Staff friendly, efficient (check-in, gate, attendants) even if like always there 1 or 2 staff which are not. Very good entertainment choices although too little dubbed or subtitled in other languages."
"""Seat good for economy class""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to Milan. The flight was good, pushback at expected time. The cabin crew service was slow, food was horrible. Seat was good for economy class. IFE was fine but not as good as Emirates."
"""not recommend this airline""","❎ Not Verified | Atlanta to Orlando. First and last time flying Delta Air Lines. Would not recommend this airline to any person. Terrible customer service when they delayed our flight three times and ended up canceling. We were also told that there would be no flights to our destination in the next two days due to it being already full from earlier cancellations. Not to mention, the hotels nearby were already filled with reservation and they provided the least possible amount of customer service in a very rude along with unprofessional manner. Our former flight before our connecting flight was also a disaster to say the least. Never have I ever landed at the destination only to wait an hour just to get off the plane. Why? This was all due to Delta's poor planning of available gates for incoming planes. When we did get to the gate, we had to wait for their crew to actually do their job for once for us to actually enter the airport. That was an additionally ten minute delay. Absolutely terrible communication between their workers. Delta, get your act together and actually prioritize your customers."
"""highly recommend Delta Comfort""","✅ Trip Verified | We’ve always had a good experience with Delta. We never have experienced big delays, the flight attendants are friendly and helpful, the reservations people are very helpful, and the seats are usually very comfortable. The entertainment is very good, the food is okay, and the legroom is usually pretty good. On this flight we got upgraded to Delta Comfort, I usually fly economy. Our flight from Seattle to Beijing was smooth, and comfortable. I highly recommend Delta Comfort, the extra legroom and recline really does make a great difference. Delta does do its best to satisfy customers, and those who gave Delta a bad review, I have to say that everyone had bad experiences, but in order to judge a airline, you have to have at least flown them 3 times in recent years (0-2 years ago)."
"""attendants were really amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | New York to San Diego. I am really scared of flying and every trip is very horrifying for me. My friend and I took a Delta flight 440 from JFK to San Diego on November 29, our flight attendants were really amazing and on point. They were very friendly and polite. Definitely made our flight as enjoyable as possible. Thank you gentlemen and thank you Delta for such great experience. Also movie and entertainment selection was amazing. WiFi on board for free was a huge plus as well."
"""I was pleased""","✅ Trip Verified | My husband and I took a trip to celebrate our 36 year anniversary flying from Atlanta to Jacksonville and I tell you from the time we got on the plane to the time we left, I was pleased. Every one of the crew staff did an excellent job. The pilot landed the plane smoothly. My husband and I will be flying Delta from now on."
"""very kind and taking care of me""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Santo Domingo via New York. I want to thank staff of Delta Air Lines. Mandy at London Heathrow on 16th November helped me very well with a request for an Esta and checked me in for my next flight to Atlanta. She was very kind and taking care of me because I was really in panic - thank you very much. Delta Air Lines were really kind and the food and drinks were good."
"""avoid this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Jacksonville. This airline does not work with moving your flights forward without an additional fee. However, Delta has no problem disrespecting your travel arrangements and pushing your flight back. For someone who will be traveling frequently for work, this is not who I want to deal with on a regular basis. I will take every opportunity possible to convince others to avoid this airline."
"""the family were split up""","✅ Trip Verified | This was a family holiday to Disney. Myself and my wife, our son, his wife and three grand children aged 5, 4 and 2. Delta changed the flight schedule five times after the original booking including one with a suggested connection arrival time into Detroit after the flight to Amsterdam had actually left! I have never know so many changes to occur on what appeared to be a frequent basis! My issue however is with seat allocation and the way that Delta change it! On the flight from Orlando to Atlanta (A321) we had selected two rows of three seats one behind the other (the infant was not allocated a seat). Delta split this into 2x2 and 2x1 seats with the four and five year olds being allocated seats on their own. Madness! On the next flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam (A330) we had reserved a block of 4 seats in the central aisle of row 37 with two seats behind in row 38. Delta then changed this to the four in row 37 and two in row 31 so that (in their words) ""we could all be together""! Again the family were split up for no apparent reason! Do Delta have a vendetta against families sitting together? The food on this leg was also the worst that I have ever encountered on an international flight. Tasteless and inedible. It seemed to comprise random bits thrown together. The flights were cheap but so was everything else!"
"""Save yourself the money and headache""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew New York JFK to Fort Lauderdale. This is my 5th or 6th flight with Delta Air Lines and every single flight has been delayed due to a problem with the aircraft. I always want to give them another chance and it is always poor. Maybe if they were on time to their job then I would be able to fly on time. JetBlue is the only airline I will be flying with for now on. Save yourself the money and headache and never fly with Delta."
"""seat is very uncomfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | On December 29th 2016 I flew Delta business Class from Seattle to Seoul Incheon. The whole flight I was thirsty and hungry. The food that was served was so terrible. Half way into the flight I asked for a snack. It took over 45 minutes for me to get my snack, the staff was nowhere to be seen. The seat is very uncomfortable. Delta uses leather seats, and when you sit or lay a long time on leather it is very uncomfortable."
"""Worst airline ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Vancouver to San Francisco via Seattle. Worst airline ever. My transfer flight was delayed for the third time in a row with a last minute notice. 45 minutes lay over, turned to a 3 hours waiting. No customer service whatsoever. Will never use Delta Airlines again and not recommend to friends and family."
"""Over priced and unreliable""","✅ Trip Verified | Oakland to Orlando. Over priced and unreliable. Will never fly with them again. They do not give enough notice of delays so you can make other plans. They don't even try to offer anything to make up for it. Just a bag of pretzels. They are sorry. Please to have delays going both ways on a flight just means bad airline. And paid $900 for this, it sucks."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | This was my first time flying with Delta from Atlanta to Houston. I usually fly United. Boarding was at 11:20am. I got there at 11:35am as the security line was pretty long. When I boarded the plane it looked almost full. The only thing I had with me was 1 carry on. I could not find space in the first class section, so I walked down to about the 15th row of seats and could not find a space for it all. I decided to go backup to the front and let the flight attendant know about my situation. The line of the passengers behind me was building up as they were boarding the plane trying to get to their seats while I was trying to get back to the front. The flight attendant saw me and noticed that I was trying to get back up to the front. I was able to tell her my problem, She gave me the most nasty attitude as if it was my fault that there was no more room on the plane for my carry on. I was in shock - a first class customer struggling with my carry on and here she is acting like if it was my fault! This is the last thing I would expect from a flight attendant under the circumstances I was in. Will never fly with Delta again if there is other options available."
"""domestic crew are far less professional""","✅ Verified Review | Flew New York JFK to Philadelphia. This flight did not last a full hour and I must mention that there is a marked difference between the friendliness of the international crew of Delta and the domestic crew of Delta. The domestic crew are far less professional on their behavior and attitude to passengers onboard. My connecting flight from Italy to New York arrived on time however the bags were placed late on the belt and by the time I made it through US customs and walked from gate 14 to 33 because no one in JFK was willing to help I arrived at the plane seconds before they closed the door. Upon entering the aircraft I was surprised because the flight attendant told me to sit in seat 4 D (Business Class) I thought this was due to the delay as a way of saying thank you I quickly found out she made a mistake and in front of everyone asked me to leave the cabin (I was embarrassed to say the least), realizing what she had done she offered me a ""Comfort Seat"", to be honest I did not notice any difference between that seat and a regular seat on coach. I have to say the aircraft looked brand new, clean and before I could buckle my seatbelt we were already in Philadelphia. Delta’s iPhone app is great for tracking your bags and other flight related info. My only observation is the marked difference between the domestic and the international crew. Overall I would fly Delta again, the planes look and feel new, clean, the seats and space are better than their other US competitors. Good job Delta just please could you retrain your domestic crew to be more like your international crew? I’m still a fan regardless of that!"
"""impressed with their service""","✅ Verified Review | This was my first time flying Delta International from Milan to New York and I have to say I am impressed with their service and the attention to detail provided by the aircrew. I was hoping to get their signature airplane, the new Airbus 350 however the equipment we flew in Airbus 330 was very nice. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants if I could move to an empty row and she was very nice and said to me that I could grab any seat I wished so I went on and sat on an empty row of 2. I have attached multiple pictures to show the menu with the great choices they give you (in coach!), the airplane had Wi-Fi for the entire nine hour flight, however I must mention that the entertainment was not good. The TV shows and the music channels were not working. To be honest that was not a deterrent because I was thrilled with the Wi-Fi and thanks to my T-Mobile plan I had one free hour plus unlimited texting on Messenger and WhatsApp. I usually fly internationally on European or Asian airlines because the service provided by US-based companies is poor however Delta is changing this and they are a strong competitor in this route up to par with European-based airlines, they can’t match the Asian airlines yet but compared to other US companies they provide a superior service and I would fly Delta international again for sure. I must make an observation about Delta’s new ""Comfort Seat"" I’m not sure it’s worth the money because I did not see a difference between that seat and the one I had. I hope they expand to premium economy on more flights. Overall I give Delta two thumbs up!"
"""1 of 4 flights actually happened""","✅ Verified Review | I booked Spokane to San Jose, then San Jose to Spokane. This originally consisted of 4 flights. Spokane to Seattle and Seattle to San Jose and vice versa. Only 1 of those flights actually happened. I was notified and hour before my first flight that it had been cancelled and was only offered a flight leaving in the next 30 minutes or a flight leaving 6 hours later than planned. The flights did not go through Seattle either, they went through Salt Lake City. This wasn’t a huge deal. I got to San Jose a little earlier than planned, but not without the headache. On the way back to Spokane, my flight from San Jose to Seattle went accordingly. However on arrival to SeaTac airport, I was informed of a delay. I was also told that I would be leaving from gate D4. I went to D4 and the screen said Eugene Oregon. So, I updated my email and it said I was actually to leave from S16. I went to gate S16. There was nothing. I asked the concierge desk and they said flight from D4 had left. So I switched to the next flight to Spokane. Which was only a stand-by ticket. I figured since I had an hour, I’d check if D4 had actually left. It had not. They would not switch me back to my original flight from D4. I am now 3 hours past my original time of departure waiting to see if I get a spot on the god forsaken plane."
"""a very pleasant experience""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to New York JFK. A very pleasant experience with Delta, check-in and bag drop at LAX was seamless, despite long lines for the security at terminal 2. However the boarding process was a bit hectic and it feels like Delta is trying to cram as many flights into the small terminal 2 at LAX. Flight services on the cross-continent flight are wonderful. Glad to see they've upgraded the personal entertainment system on the 767s into newer larger HD screens. It's the best flying across the country on a 767 since it's spacious and you don't have to pass 2 people to go out of your seat if you have a window seat. Really surprised that on this flight delta provided complimentary lunch for all classes (even economy!) The beef pastrami sandwich was so good it made into one of the best pastrami I've ever had! Food was well-plated and presented too, with a side salad and desserts. Delta also now provides free wifi for texting and messaging on all flights! This is a game changer! Big shout out to Delta for bringing back free meals and making flying an enjoyment again!"
"""business class old and outdated""","✅ Verified Review | Munich to Tampa via Atlanta. First time I have flown Delta internationally as it is not an airline I typically fly or prefer. But due to an attractive airfare from Germany to Florida in business class I decided to give it a try. I was shocked about the age of the plane and the seating for business class. Both are old and outdated. I read Delta decided to keep its aging aircraft and not turn over for newer aircraft and clearly this route is one of those where the older planes are utilized. Their terminal location at the Munich airport is in keeping with their aircraft, old beat up, primitive and a lot of cattle herding before boarding the aircraft. Once onboard and into my seat I realized the business class seats were really out of date in both design and fittings. The video system failed and was unavailable for the flight which was a real drag for 9.4 hours. The provided headphones were cheap copies of Bose which in other airlines is a standard for business and first class. (Return flight I will be sure to download movies and bring my own headset.) The food service looked good but the chicken meal was so overcooked and the cooked spinach was filled with grit. The light meal served before landing in Atlanta was so salty I could not eat it either. So both meals were inedible and a good thing I had a solid breakfast before boarding the flight. Seat was comfortable but very tight unless one is 150 lbs and under 5'10"". A blanket and good size pillow was provided which helped. Bottled water was provided so one did not have to ring for the flight attendant for something to drink. Because of the configuration of the 767 the bathroom was behind business class and attached next to the food preparation area for coach passengers. This also meant sharing those bathrooms with coach passengers as well. Though I never had to wait for a free bathroom. Again, old plane with a older design compared to the new standards most airlines now have for their bread and butter business class passengers. OK for the much talked about service model that Delta staff employ for its business class passengers is true they do really try hard to be charming and helpful but I suspect it is to cover up all the Delta deficiencies has using these out of date aircraft. But in the end it did not help the fact the food was terrible, the video system did not work and the airport waiting, boarding process was much akin to a SouthWest experience."
"""friendly and efficient staff""","✅ Verified Review | Edmonton to Seattle. A full service carrier that is working hard to improve their service. Check in was easy - a more than helpful staff member assisted me. The in flight service was provided by friendly and efficient staff - they seemed to enjoy their job. The aircraft seats were comfortable with adequate (not ample) legroom. The food and beverage service was good. Overall, a pleasant change from other full service carriers. Delta seemed to be trying to deliver genuine service"
"""generous meals and drinks""","✅ Verified Review | Flew with Delta on their first A350-900 flight from Tokyo to Detroit. The seat was okay. Delta was very generous with their in-flight meals and drinks. The IFE screen on the A350-900 was large and very easy to navigate. As I was sitting at the back, the space in the overhead storage area was reduced to accommodate the crew rest area. The Narita-based crew seemed more approachable and friendlier compared to the Detroit-based crew."
"""Stay away from Delta""","✅ Verified Review | Flew London Heathrow to New York JFK. We were unable to book a seat without paying for them even on the day of the flight. We were told at check in we would receive seats at the gate but not before and they could not guarantee I would be seated next to my children, it could possibly be in front of or behind but they would not discuss why I didn't have seats. I was travelling with my two children and this was worrying. When we went through security we could not scan our boarding passes and were told by security that we were on standby. This was very upsetting, I had booked the tickets months earlier. Finally on the flight, my son, was in the row in front of me, the first statement the steward made was, ""We are very understaffed and I don't know how we'll cope"". Our return flight with Virgin Airways was wonderful. Everything from seats, 72 hours in advance with no charge, to staff, to check in and all employees were efficient, polite, and very professional. Stay away from Delta!"
"""at check out they raise the price""","✅ Verified Review | New York La Guardia to Syracuse. When you book online with Delta they will give you one price and then right at check out they raise the price. This is the second time this occurred with me and its an unethical and frustrating pattern. I havent experienced this issue with other airlines and that leads me to believe this is a pattern."
"""I was impressed""","✅ Verified Review | Seoul to Atlanta via Houston. This was my first time flying Delta and I was impressed. Delta's Comfort + was the most comfortable I've been on in a long time for the price ($1100). That's at least $300 less then other airlines economy class running the Asia route vs Delta's premium Comfort plus. The staff was nice and accommodating, despite there being some confusion with Incheon crew, I think they were in training or new staff cause they seemed a bit nervous so minus a star there. Flight wise, food was above average in taste with 3 selections, not your mom's home cooking but satisfying. Best of all, the free Starbucks and Bailey's on the house and other drink selection was a fantastic touch. Free messaging wifi helped me kept in contact with those below and organize schedules. (Kakao Talk worked, even though it was not on the list of usable apps, so I think any messaging app is ok as long as you don't send pictures or files you're fine.) Delta also gave free face mask, ear plugs and ear phones. Movie infotainment system selection was great. Leg room was ample my knees didn't touch the back on the person in front at all even at front on a full recline, I'm 5'10"". Seats were plush and soft and my the neck rest didn't feel annoying like some airlines that leave you craning. Would definitely fly again in the future. I hope Delta continues to service the Asia route because someone needs to take out United's long haul dominance and end them already."
"""coach seat was so cramped""","✅ Verified Review | San Antonio to Munich via Atlanta on 6 Oct 2017 and returned via Detroit 16 Oct 2017. The flights within USA were okay, not bad. The transatlantic flights were awful, specifically the Atlanta to Munich leg. I am not a giant, my inseam measures 30 inches. The coach seat was so cramped I could not close my legs together. The aisles were to narrow to walk for exercise. After 9 hours in that seat i was in pain when i reached Munich. On the return trip I was able to get my seat changed to an emergency exit row (all upgrade seats were booked). I will never fly Delta for an international flight again."
"""treated as second class citizens""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Tampa. Anyone below First class and business class were treated as second class citizens. On the return trip we didn't get a seat when we checked in online. It said that the seat would be assigned at the gate. Which gate? I had no idea, because Delta doesn't bother to put it on the ticket. Anyway, a line started to form as the agent got to the gate. She gave the first person in line a seat, the next person a seat and then the third person in line a seat and told the rest of us to sit down unless we were will to give up our reservation for a voucher. She said ""I need to work on the voucher people first"". I was second in line at that point and I asked ""will you at least call the people who were in line first?"" She said she would take my name; I didn't move. The man right offered to take a later flight, but when he was told it was the next day, he sat down. I ended up getting my seat assignments; I presume because she didn't want me to cause anymore trouble. She kept asking for people to take a $600 voucher to give up their paid reservation. Then they start on the carry on luggage threat. ""if you are in zones 2 or 3, there isn't going to be any room to store your carry on. We'll check your bag for free"" I don't want to check my bag, it takes longer to get out of the airport and my husband's bag has been lost several times. We ended up checking our bags and boy was that a mistake! the fly was short but bumpy. We went to claim our package and saw the 20 guarantee. What a joke! After 20 minutes with no bags I went to the baggage claim help center, which was NO help, they told me to wait another 5 minutes that the bags were still on the plane. the bags didn't come out until over 35 minutes. No such guarantee."
"""no intention of handling the case""","✅ Verified Review | On 20 Sept 2017 we left Ft Lauderdale, FL on a Delta flight bound for Moscow via Atlanta and Amsterdam. Unfortunately, Delta Airlines did not get my baggage on the flight from Atlanta to Amsterdam. My bags didn't get to me in Moscow until the morning of 24 Sept, 4 days late and the day before we were leaving to return to the USA. I had only the casual clothes on my back, and had to buy clothes to wear during the day Saturday, clothes for a semi-formal affair scheduled for Sat night, and for a Sunday visit to St. Sergius Monastery. Shopping in Moscow is expensive and my XL size in most clothing is difficult to find. In a phone call to Delta Customer Service from Moscow (via satellite phone) I was told to ""buy what i needed and I would be reimbursed. "" Now, Delta is saying that their ""partner"" Aeroflot , the airline we arrived on in Moscow, needs to take care of the claim and will not help. Delta has no intention of handling the case or reimbursing me, even though the baggage screw-up occurred on their flight in Atlanta."
"""unhappy with the situation""","✅ Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Orlando. Our trip out was delayed making it difficult to meet connecting flight. Had to run to make it! Our return flight, the times were changed and then to make matters worse was arriving back to Salt Lake City without my luggage. Not sure if I will get it. Pretty unhappy with the situation."
"""Delta is always my last choice""","✅ Verified Review | Minneapolis to Seattle. I flew with Delta last week, they separated our seats at last second and delayed our flight while on the plane. After sitting in the tarmac for 2 hours we finally took off. I got upgraded, which was basically the same as economy and my boyfriends economy seat had maybe 8 inches of leg room. This week we made the mistake of using basic economy which really means only middle seats in the back of the plane. Had we known that we would have picked a different option. My boyfriend can’t fit in a middle seat, and he isn’t even that big (6 ft, 190 lbs). We call Delta 1.5 hour hold times. Get to the gate and the staff is rude, which always seems to be the case with them. Why are their employees so unhappy? It rubs off on the customers. I fly at least monthly, Delta is always my last choice."
"""disappointed with my treatment""","✅ Verified Review | I am so disappointed with my treatment this evening. My partner and I booked flights round trip from SAN to SPM. My partner was unable to make the return flight after hearing news that he was needed in Puerto Rico to attend emergency family matters from the hurricanes. He booked a new flight from MKE to San Juan and then a return back to SAN, all on Delta. After spending thousands of dollars, I was confronted by a very rude attendant on the flight tonight reprimanding me for him not being on the original flight. She was rude and embarrassed me in front of a full cabin."
"""Delay after delay""","✅ Verified Review | Louisville to Dallas via Atlanta. I will never fly Delta again! Delay after delay. Missed connecting flight. I called customer service and the girl I was speaking with wouldn't even give me her or her supervisors name so I could make a complaint. Customer service isn't there priority. If I could give them a zero rating I would. Never again."
"""Overall I am very upset""","✅ Verified Review | Fargo to Boise via Minneapolis. Could have done more to compensate me after a four hour delay in Fargo due to a flat tire. Had to stay in Minneapolis and got to my hotel late. No meal voucher offered. All of my children and grandchildren traveled to visit me for my 65th Birthday. The celebration was delayed because of the flight delay. I asked you if I could get upgraded to first class the next day on my connecting flight due to all of the problems, missing my 65th Birthday celebration and I was told no. Instead I was offered a 200 dollar voucher or 10000 miles. Very poor offer with all that happened and making my 65th Birthday a miserable day. After all of the flights I have taken on Delta this year it makes me wonder if I am a valuable customer. I am a Vice President for a hotel company and had a guest presented these circumstances to one of my hotels, I would have treated that guest like royalty and given him the best room along with meals and even the next stay on us. Overall I am very upset. With all of the poor publicity that airlines are receiving for being apethetic towards their customers, I thought your company would have treated me with empathy and value my business. Instead all I did was continue to hear “ no, there is nothing more we can do”. Very disappointed."
"""onboard experience very good""","✅ Verified Review | Brussels to New York JFK. My first Delta experience was very positive. The smooth proces of checking in and breezing through security and immigration shows the advantage of a quite small airport as Brussels, in comparison to my home airport AMS. Only disadvantage: poor lounge. Delta uses the BA lounge, which has very limited F&B options. Dissapointing. But the onboard experience was very good. The FA working in my area (seat 1A), as well the purser of the flight was very friendly. The other two FA's in C were very kind as well and we had long conversations. F&B: outstanding. The only con was the IFE. A bit limited in content and the overpriced WiFi wasn't worth it for me to give it a try."
"""will continue to recommend Delta""","✅ Verified Review | St Thomas to Atlanta. On October 15, my husband, our two dogs (weighing 60lbs and 50lbs, respectively) and I boarded Delta flight 674 from St. Thomas. We were stressed: having just been through 2 category 5 hurricanes, the loss of both our jobs and relocating to the mainland, we had little in our emotional reserves as we attempted to settle into our seats. Our flight attendant immediately welcomed us and gave special attention to our heavily sedated dogs. Tina listened to our story and made us feel like the only passengers aboard the full aircraft. I witnessed her executing her duties throughout the flight in a professional, timely and warm manner, and being a lifetime service industry professional, myself, I noted how she engaged her passengers with genuine courtesy. The mark of a true professional is evident when things are going less than perfect, however, and she handled a potentially unpleasant situation with grace and expediency. We are now lifelong customers and will continue to recommend Delta to all our friends and family."
"""She humiliated me""","✅ Verified Review | Greensboro to Atlanta. Flight attendant asks, cookie or pretzel? Me: Can I have both? FA: Did I offer you both? Me: It’s ok then, don’t worry about it. FA: I’m only teasing! Not a funny joke! She humiliated me in front all the people around me that heard her! I would fine if she answered me with “you can only pick one”. Very rude. Will Delta go bankrupt over a cookie and a pretzel that she had to make a big deal about me wanting both? I’ve always like flying Delta than other airlines, I’m not sure anymore now!"
"""with a very bad attitude""","✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Tampa. Horrible experience. Delayed take off, due to mechanical issues. Ground crew asked to check-in all rolling carry-on, but no one helped while boarding. Flight attendants forget their mission is to help passengers and instead are bitter with a very bad attitude. Small legroom and no entertainment onboard."
"""generally pleasant and efficient""","✅ Verified Review | Raleigh Durham to Boston. Flew Delta on three segments in early October. All flights were on CRJ-900 regional jets. Flights left and arrived on time. Crews generally pleasant and efficient. Pilot on the first flight (RDU-BOS) came into the cabin before departure to introduce himself and the crew and provide flight info - a nice touch. Seating tight but tolerable for a short flight. Planes in decent shape and reasonably clean. Delta had changed my routing after I purchased the tickets which was not an issue for me as the timing was essentially the same. However, they did not send an advisory on this but, fortunately, I double check reservations a couple of time before I travel so I caught the change. I did print out all my copies of the schedule to be on the safe side and this turned out to be useful. When we arrived in Toronto on the return leg, the computer system did not seem to recognize the revised booking. When we could not get our boarding passes and the agent questioned our booking, I had the documentation and, though it took about 15-20 minutes, she finally got us sorted out and printed our boarding passes. Of course, they did not work when we went to board our flight but the gate agent saw the correction and got us sorted out quickly. Everyone who worked on the issue was helpful which kept our stress levels (relatively) low."
"""the plane was broken""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Frankfurt to Atlanta. Every time I have flown with Delta, I have had problems. Today the plane landed at the terminal on time, but the plane was broken. This 1.5 hour delay made me miss my connecting flight. They came over the announcement and said it was our job to ensure we scheduled our connecting flights when we land because it is out of their control. I have been away from home for 6 months and would like to be able to depend on an airline to get me there."
"""lack of punctuality""","✅ Verified Review | Flights seem to always be delayed and by at least one, if not several hours. If this is going to consistently happen, I don't understand why Delta couldn't just plan for delays better because this is a waste of everyone's time. Even though everything else is sufficient, the lack of punctuality is very inconvenient."
"""Amazing flight attendants""","✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Los Angeles in Delta One is superb even on the 757 which is not quite as grand as the 767. Food, seats, entertainment and service are as good as it gets, JetBlue Mint is tops and this is right up there. Amazing flight attendants. LAX to Kona. Big downgrade, especially in seats. Barely first class qualified. Flight attendants have nothing to work with and do an amazing job in tight quarters with really mediocre food offerings. They made up for most of the shortcomings on this route."
"""above and beyond expectations""","✅ Verified Review | The flight attendants on my Delta flight going to Atlanta and returning home to Newark were some of the most caring I have seen. They took the time to make sure I was doing ok when I was having a tough time with my assigned seat and the flights. They went above and beyond expectations, and I am grateful for them during a rough time."
"""awful customer service""","✅ Verified Review | This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. They changed my flight without notice, turning a 12 hour day into a 22 hour day of flying and sitting in airports. I could have forgiven that had their employees had one ounce of sympathy. Their cold uncaring response is what makes Delta the worst airline. One of them stated, well we have to talk to a lot of people, when I pointed out their awful customer service."
"""One of the best flights ""","✅ Verified Review | One of the best flights I have been on! Two of the flight attendants spent time letting every passenger know their connecting gate in Detroit and how to navigate the Airport. This was amazing and appreciated by everyone. All attendants should be giving passengers this kind of service and she did it with a smile! Will continue to use Delta and hope the airlines train all employees to be like this! Great flight, #2807 4:59 from Laguardia to Detroit."
"""Everything was perfect""","✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Detroit. I was apprehensive about travelling by Delta Air Lines but this was the best flight we have been on travelling to USA. Everything was perfect, the crew were friendly, food was delicious and the seating was really comfortable. Beats BA any day. Thank you Delta."
"""Delayed flight again""","✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to New York JFK. Delayed flight again, 3 hours this time. I hate flying Delta and this is the last time I will fly Delta. I was forced to use Delta this time. You would figure a major airline like Delta would have figured out how to be on time. Hawaiian Airlines hardly ever has delayed flights."
"""helpful friendly people""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Edmonton to San Francisco via Seattle. What a pleasant surprise - a domestic US carrier that is working hard to improve customer service. Check in was efficient and staffed by helpful friendly people. Boarding was equally efficient. The flight attendants worked hard to deliver genuine service and nothing was ever a problem. This was my 5th and 6th flight with Delta Air Lines this year - I have been trying them after consistent issues with AA. Based on this experience I will be using them more often. They seem to be working to lift their game."
"""terrible customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Terrible customer service. Delta allows you to book a flight for a certain day and time and will then change your itinerary by 6hours weeks to months later, with no remediation if their new flight plan for you doesn't work with all the travel plans you've made. Secondly, they routinely check all rollerboards for zone 3 passengers no matter that there are always plenty of overhead spaces. They just don't care that passengers might prefer to keep their possessions with them (which I do, having had checked luggage not arrive with me more times than I can count). Thirdly, seats are very uncomfortable, forcing everyone into a hunched position. One positive is that the last couple planes I've been on have had more leg room and wider aisles than I'm used to. In summary, hate that airlines take advantage of customers. Unfortunately, Delta isn't the only one that does this."
"""level of service was the best""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Lisbon, returning Dublin to new York. The price, despite being in summer season, was excellent, especially in comparison to most other options. The level of service was the best we've experienced in many years of travel. It begins with the cockpit crew and attendants greeting passengers on entrance to and departure from the flights. They seemed more personable and enthusiastic than is common, and communicated pride and pleasure in their work. The food was surprisingly good and plentiful, free beverages were varied and frequent. We counted two passes with hot towels and four involving beverages. The entertainment options were fresh and divergent.Finally, we were forced to return due to a member of family's medical emergency. Delta could not have been more supportive and considerate related to this circumstance. Delta has announced in this past week, the upcoming utilization of a system involving in flight wifi free of charges will be initiated in the near future."
"""disappoints in their ability to deliver""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Augusta. Once again Delta disappoints in their ability to deliver anything close to the promised service. I know complaining about small planes is played out but in this case I went out of my way to purchase specific luggage that meets all airline requirements and of course none of the provided storage space was as advertised. And to top it off the flight was delayed, again. Honestly would travel any other airline if possible. This has to be one of the shorter flights in the country and still service is poor."
"""worst traveling experience""","✅ Verified Review | San Diego to New York. I booked my tickets through Delta.com and there's an options between choosing Main Cabin (couple dollars more to pick the seats) and the regular Economy. Having paid a couple more dollars, I was able to secure seats for my family and me. I received a confirmation e-mail and everything looked good. It would've been the perfect vacation / honeymoon for me and my husband who got married a week before. Delta gave me the worst traveling experience ever. I bought a total of 16 tickets in the span of 2 weeks for me and my family. I just want to sit next to my husband. I paid to achieve that. I reserved seats 32A and 32B, but when we went to check in, we got seats 35A and 34B. I paid for a service and didn't get it. I was traveling with my mom and aunt as well as my husband, but because they left half way, I thought I just booked the seats and would've figured out seating arrangements amongst ourselves when we got on the plane. I realized that even though I reserved seats, I didn't get them. Who separates the newlyweds? You can count on Delta!"
"""Delta treated me great ""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Cleveland. Delta treated me great when I needed to return home 2 days earlier due to husband illness, they made it very simple and even though I had not purchased insurance they only had be pay a 50Dollar fee. Also no problems with boarding the flight, everyone was great."
"""they refused to give service""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Ft Myers. They overbooked the flight to include my ticket, leaving me stranded at Hartsfield since it was the last flight out back to RSW, and said that I would have to find another flight. Waited at the gate kiosk for 15 minutes only to have them rudely direct me to a delta customer service counter. There, I had to wait for almost an hour and once I talked to the lady she said that since I was an economy customer she could not rebook me for another flight since I had a zero balance available. It was their fault they overbooked and they refused to give service. They said I could try calling the customer service number to order another full price ticket (for $458). Found a way better deal with Southwest for $230 that left at a better time."
"""food was rather sub-standard""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Sydney. Delta had a 3x3x3 layout in economy class on this Boeing 777 on this flight from LA to Sydney. I had an economy comfort seat, which features more legroom and slightly more recline, both valuable assets on a 14 hours flight. The seat was comfortable, and I could catch some sleep. The service was decent. However, the food was rather sub-standard. I had a tasteless cheese ravioli dish. At least, I cannot complain regarding the amount of food available: Delta served a snack in the middle of the flight (sandwich, apple, cookie) and breakfast (French toast). Furthermore, they had a snack bar where you could serve yourself during the flight."
"""she had given my seat away""","✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Ft Lauderdale. I've purchased an online ticket and when I get to the airport I was assigned my seat in boarding pass. At the gate i was informed by the agent the flight is overbooked and if I do decide to go on a later flight I will be awarded with an $800 voucher since it was not to late and sounds great so I said yes I'm in, then she took my boarding pass she copied and told me to go ahead and have a she'll call. I was very hungry but I waited till everyone board which was over an hr of course, later she called my name then she gave me a new boarding pass she said go in, like I had no choice. So I get on the plane, after takeoff I grabbed my book and found my original boarding pass with a seat that the attendant just gave a free earpiece to, and I was just charged for one. I realized she had given my seat away to someone else and give me a broken seat. When I point it out to the flight attendant she said there's nothing they can do for me that the flight is full (with empty first class seats of course) however she will send a red code to the counter at the exit, and go talk to an agent when landed which I did - at the counter in FLL she completely ignored me. She had told me to call if I have a complaint she's busy."
"""Airplanes quite new, service reasonable""","✅ Verified Review | Delta allowed me to change our destination due to Hurricane Irma free of charge, on the day of the flight. I see this as an extraordinarily positive gesture. Airplanes quite new, service reasonable. On national flights weaker refreshments. Overall good price-value ratio."
"""Bad service, rude behavior""","✅ Verified Review | San Jose to Atlanta. I have seen a lot of service on airplanes, good and bad. This service before the boarding was by far the worst experience in a long time. Online Check In didn't work due to technical issues, no seats available at check in to sit next to each other. Even three hours before. Exit was available but didn't give us without charge. No customer service as I expect. Was supposed to ask at gate, waited 20 Min and the answer was ""No, flight full. Next please"". Very rude and not friendly at all. A good explanation would be fine. Was questioned by employee about visit to Costa Rica without letting me know about the reasons for his questions. Don't recommend this airline. Bad service, rude behavior."
"""service was very good""","✅ Verified Review | Amsterdam to Seattle. I have to admit having read the reports on this site I wasn't looking forward to this flight but the service was very good, the flight attendants professional and helpful and food/drinks offered were good quality and well presented. Seat was comfortable. If I have a complaint the IFE film selection was not particularly my choice but there was enough I could pick from for the flight."
"""gate agent gave it away""","✅ Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Raleigh Durham on DL1846. Paid for business class ticket and gate agent gave it away to someone else when I was in the terminal, on my way to the gate (using restroom -- sometimes you gotta go), more than 10 minutes before departure. When I arrived, the gate agent essentially said ""too bad, I can do what I want"" with a big ""forget you"" to a very loyal customer. I guess 650,000+ miles in the last five years doesn't mean much to these guys."
"""friendly, helpful and informative""","✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Portland. I had the pleasure of travelling to and from Portland with the same cabin crew. They were really efficient, friendly, helpful and informative, not only in terms of in flight support but also useful data and advice re our time in Oregon. Further, despite being very approachable they maintained a highly professional approach. In respect of the food, there was a good range on the menu and the ""hot food"" was actually hot. The only small downside re refreshments was that we were not provided with the usual pre-flight drink on our way back from Portland. Seating and in flight entertainment were fine though I did not find the flatbed particularly comfortable. My thanks to all the great cabin staff( and of course the pilots), for facilitating two enjoyable flights."
"""The service was very good""","✅ Verified Review | Had a very pleasant flight with Delta from Atlanta to Bogotá. Delta uses a narrow-body Boeing 757-200 for this flight, which features the same business class as in domestic flights. It has five rows with 2x2 recliner seats. But for a four-hour flight, this is perfectly sufficient. The service was very good, and the food was tasty. Delta usually has a meat and a vegetarian option on this flight. I had a salad, Ravioli with fresh vegetables and a fruit platter for desert. I could not have asked for more."
"""We had very good customer service""","✅ Verified Review | We had very good customer service on our recent trip to Tampa! I was worried about traveling in light of the negative publicity surrounding different airlines, especially traveling with a 5 year old, a 2 year old and infant. Allowing us to board first and get settled was very helpful as well as allowing us to check car seats, strollers at no cost. But the best part was when we were coming back and my 2year old grandson had had enough refusing to buckle, wanting to get out of his seat, etc. We were in the very back seat next to the stewardesses seat. A lady sat beside him and held his hand and talked with him, got him cookies and juice, showed him pictures of her children while we were taking off and landing. She was so good and sweet with him! Really made our trip home less stressful and more enjoyable!"
"""Amazing crew of flight attendants""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Los Angeles. First the planes--thus gates--were switched last minute. Shuttled across the airport and boarded to find that we were delayed because they had to verify the switch (due to a faulty turbo needed for Alaska but not Los Angeles) and because we had too much fuel (again, needed for Alaska not LA). Then because during the now 90 min wait with no air conditioning on a 85+ degree day* we'd used gas from one side of the plane and not the other so it had to be siphoned over. Amazing crew of flight attendants gave us water for the heat and encouraged us to file official complaints. But that 1/2 glass of ice-less water each used up the entire flight's supply. Lots of unhappy flyers, crew, and missed connections."
"""I will never fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Stockholm to New York City. First leg of the trip was met with a 3 hour delay then for our return flight my one son with special needs was not allowed to check in online, while the rest of my family, consisting of myself and my three other children, were cleared. He was subjected to a ""random"" security check that was stress inducing and confusing for my other children. I will never fly Delta again! This is how they treat families with young children? Never again."
"""I should expect no level of service whatsoever""","✅ Verified Review | A new level of awful. My curiosity got the better of me. Could Delta be as bad as everyone I knew told me it was. I should have trusted my instinct. A clapped out old A330, clapped out cabin design, the seat to be fair was comfortable and I did get a good sleep. Dinner service did not happen as they did not have enough beef to cater for the needs of their business passengers. Sat in seat 4J I was surprised to learn that you need to sit on the ""captains side"" of the plane if you want to get your choice of meal with Delta. The crew member I spoke to was wholly disinterested in any form of complaint and said ""Listen what do you want?"" Naturally I considered approaching the purser on the plane to speak to him about perhaps guiding his staff on how to deal with premium passengers. When I learned a few moments later that this guy was the purser I realised that my night was over and this was a bus service to Atlanta and that I should expect no level of service whatsoever. Looking for good things. The seat, thats it. Bring your own food, don't expect any manners, get on the bus, sit down, shut up and you'll get to your destination in one piece. I spend a lot of my own money flying in a style that I like to enjoy. Delta failed, failed and failed again. I regret that I now have to continue flying on to Paris with Delta. Thankfully this flight is in economy and as such I already have no expectation of service whatsoever."
"""such a pleasant surprise trip""","✅ Verified Review | Fayetteville to Minneapolis. Being disabled with a broken ankle, I was dreading my flight to Minneapolis. At the gate I was pleased to be helped so efficiently and pleasantly by a personable lady attendant. Upon boarding the aircraft, we were met by a steward who made us feel very welcomed and was so helpful. During the flight, he and a stewardess went over and above to make my grandson (age 7) and I have a delightful trip. The plane was beautiful- very clean and well maintained. The captain was great about keeping us informed and the flight was on time and smooth! Thank you so much for such a pleasant surprise trip!"
"""Delta let us wait for more than seven hours""","✅ Verified Review | Delta let us wait for more than seven hours (check in at 12 noon, original departure at 13.50 for flight from Seattle to Amsterdam, now expected - but still not confirmed - for 20.30). The staff are friendly enough but have no clue. Other airlines would long since have brought in a new plane or at least cancelled the flight."
"""an average experience.""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Atlanta. Nothing particulartly positive about this flight. The Delta First Class seat looks like a 1990s long-haul business class seat, with the difference it does not recline and there is no footrest. Food selection very limited (sandwich or chicken salad), I took the salad and quality was overall good; beverages selection limited as well and a Chardonnay served in a plastic glass before take.off is something simply meaningless (especially if during dinner proper glasses are used). Crew - like in the previous long-haul flight - seemed a bit too ""casual"", which can be easily misunderstood with unprofessional (I have been more than once addressed as ""honey"" during the flight). IFE very good on such a short flight, with large screen and possibility to use my own headphones. Overall an average experience."
"""No compassion or empathy""","✅ Verified Review | My son is in the military in Killeen Tx, he has a four day weekend coming up and wants to come visit. I purchased his tickets from Killeen to Panama City (United) for August 31 and the return trip on Delta for September 4th. Unfortunately Harvey happened and United had to cancel his outgoing flight to Panama City. I called JustFly (the online ticketing agency) and Delta to request a refund for the return trip due to the fact that my son will not be in Florida due to the cancelled flight (if he is not in Florida, he cannot utilize a flight from Florida). Justfly said they needed some sort of waiver from Delta to process a cancellation and refund, Delta said that the flight was not affected by Harvey and therefore there will be no refund. My son only had that 4 day available to come visit, yet Delta was very proud that they were willing to waive the change fee, and were gracious to give me a credit that could be used anytime before August 2018. I told them that the only reason I had to cancel the flight was because my son will not be in Florida, it only makes sense that if he is not here he cannot board a plane here. I was also informed that if I did not call Delta back on September 4th to cancel his reservation I would be charged a no show fee (funny how me being on the phone (with both Delta and Justfly for a total of 4hrs, did not qualify as notice that he would not be on the return trip, of a trip he cannot take!). I can see having an issue if someone was just willy nilly changing their minds about traveling, sure charge me a change fee, but when you are physically unable to take a trip due to circumstances beyond your control (Harvey has closed down Texas), then the airline should consider the circumstances and provide a refund and cancellation without fees or penalties in hopes that the traveller would remember how gracious the airline had been and would make sure to fly that airline in the future. Unfortunately Delta is not that type of provider, so if you are reading this review I suggest that maybe you shop elsewhere just in case (god forbid) a similar situation happens and you are stuck not able to get your money back. I am sure that Delta will be enjoying a very nice self appreciation party on my dime. No compassion or empathy for their customers."
"""crew attitude too casual""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Santiago de Chile. Quite an awful experience on a decrepit Boeing 767-300. Cabin configuration with a staggered 1-2-1, seat itself very old but sort of ok (narrow though). The worst of this flight is the inflight service, seems at Delta they don't take their premium customers seriously; food below par (entree cold, beef fillet hard as a stone); presentation so poor (when you put some warm bread on my tray, why on Earth should you put it on the butter so that it melts everywhere?). Cabin crew attitude too casual for a business class cabin. IFE in such a small screen that some smartphones are bigger; new business class blanket (by Westin) is oddly covered - on the supposedly external face in a very hard and ""plastic""-look-and-touch material which I fail to understand. Overall the service looks more like a Premium Economy than a Business Class, I keep asking myself when Delta will get rid of those old dinosaurs that are B767s"
"""flight was delayed for the same reason""","✅ Verified Review | Recently flew 4 legs from Cleveland to Minneapolis, Minneapolis to Lincoln and return. Flight time was changed to 2 hours before original scheduled time. When we got to airport flight was delayed. Flight was overbooked, took some time to find volunteers to give up seats and then assign seat numbers to the rest of us. Got notification while in the air (we weren't able to receive it until we landed) that our 9.15 flight had been delayed until 2.30. Found out that it was because of a computer glitch that sent crew to other places and it would take that long to get them back. Changed to another flight but that flight was delayed for the same reason. Clerk said this is not the first time this has happened, you should have been here Saturday! Flight was then delayed until 4.30 and eventually cancelled."
"""the aircraft interior seemed a bit beat up ""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Delta from Seattle to New Orleans via Atlanta. I chose this flight because the aircraft was internationally configured and that made the difference. It was fine but the aircraft interior seemed a bit beat up. The service was domestic of course and ok. Crew was fine. Flight was delayed two hours but assistance rebooking connection was handled well."
"""needed an alternative option""","✅ Verified Review | Raleigh Durham to La Guardia. Fell below par. The staff was nice, but our pilot was 2 hours late. A one and a half hour flight turned into 6 hours due to a pilot and the weather. Before returning home I got a alert that my flight was cancelled and that I needed to call Delta. There was a 3 hr wait time. When I called again later, I waited another hour before finally speaking with someone. She stated there were no flights leaving LGA for the rest of the week, and I find that hard to believe. She stated the only flight leaving LGA was at 6 am the very next morning and there was a possibility that the flight may not even take off due to weather conditions. I asked if I could have credit for a train or a bus at a later time. I understand that tickets are non refundable, but in the situation, I needed an alternative option. Thankfully we made it home safely even after all of the trouble and cutting our trip short."
"""best international service from a US carrier""","✅ Verified Review | Excellent service from ground staff. They use your name when scanning your boarding pass and I noticed they used everyone's surnames. Pretty impressive. Onboard flight attendants warm and cheerful. All flight attendants greeted me including those preparing the galley. Seat was a lie-flat with a Westin pillow and duvet, each individually wrapped. Great selection of movies, TV shows, games and music. Slept for most of the trip but woke for the landing service. Had beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes. Delicious! They also had laksa noodles which smelled good as well. Bathrooms clean and I like the blue LED mood lighting inside. Way to go Delta! The best international service from a US carrier so far."
"""interior cabins clean and modern""","✅ Verified Review | Victoria-Seattle-Atlanta-Washington (DCA), Delta Comfort+ class, outbound on 2 August 2017, returning 10 August, using points accumulated with KLM plus $400 in taxes and fees. In both directions, YYJ-SEA legs were served by SkyWest using CRJ-700 aircraft; SEA-ATL legs used B757 outbound and A321 for the return; ATL-DCA legs used A321s in both directions. For all legs, interior cabins were clean and modern (even the B757, a model that Boeing stopped manufacturing in 2003). A321s were brand-new, but nevertheless had the seating design problem of wasting several centimetres of available fuselage width owing to an unnecessary gap between the window-seat armrests and fuselage. A321s also had the new narrower washroom design. A pregnant or significantly overweight passenger would have difficulty turning around inside. Delta categorizes its passengers under many rubrics – Comfort Class, Comfort+ Class, Delta One Class, SkyPriority Class, Medallion Class, Premium Cabin, Main Cabin, and so on. The only clearly-named category I recognised was ""First Class"". I didn't think any of my flights had a ""First Class"", but, on one of my outbound flights, the gate agents nevertheless announced it as one of the groups for early boarding (even in advance of parents with small children and passengers using wheelchairs!). By the end of my trip, I discovered that my ""Comfort+ Class"" ticket was considered also to be in the ""Premium Cabin"" and ""SkyPriority Class"" categories, which all overlapped. A full set of definitions should have been provided as part of the ticket. IFE offered a decent selection of audio and video, but the categorisation made no sense: better to look for the full A-Z listing. For Comfort+ class, ""snacks"" were offered; but the only real food was a banana. Alcoholic beverages were supposed to be available without additional charge for Comfort+ passengers, but at no time did the FAs explicitly say so. Outbound, the ATL-DCA leg was cancelled, as were three other Delta flights that evening serving the same route. Delta apologised profusely, explaining that thunderstorms in the US northeast corridor had prevented flights from landing at DCA and mentioning air-traffic-control congestion as a contributing factor. Oddly, after I arrived in Washington the next day, friends told me they could recall no rain or thunderstorms in Washington the night before. Passengers on the cancelled flights were required to stay overnight at ATL at our own expense. Many passengers did their own rebooking of flights online. Only one Delta agent was present at the service counter near the gate to do rebooking in person. Nearby were Delta telephones where rebooking agents could be reached, but few people noticed them. For overnight lodging, Delta gave us a print-out saying that it had a ""negotiated rate"" with a nearby motor hotel, although it didn't make an outright recommendation. It was a seedy place, well worn and with visible damage to walls and fixtures. It is unwise for Delta to associate its name with that motor hotel. I had one G&T on the ATL-SEA return leg. The FA had no idea how the drink should be poured, even though I'd done my best to ask her to (i) give me a cup with a couple of ice cubes, then (ii) give me the little bottle of gin (they offered Bombay Sapphire), and then (iii) let me pour the tonic water as the last step. She kept giving me a combination of ice and tonic water first, for me to add the gin as the last step. My Grandma would be horrified."
"""Save your money, fly elsewhere""","✅ Verified Review | Chicago to Salt Lake City. Can someone please tell me why when I make my reservations weeks is advance, I am not given the option to select a seat? Then when I check in 24 hrs in advance, they again will not give me an option to select a seat? Then, I have to go to the counter to get a seat even assigned to me. Then, when I request an isle or a window I am told (with a sarcastic laugh) no due to it being an oversold flight? How again an oversold flight is my problem? I followed protocol and I get punished as a customer. I tried Delta again after a while of not using them due to similar issues, but I am sorry to say it's back to American Airlines for me. I'm sure Delta will never read this and even if they do they won't care, I'm just trying to protect fellow passengers who spend their hard earned money on this ridiculous company. Save your money and fly elsewhere!"
"""don't know where humanity went""","✅ Verified Review | We decided to fly from NYC to Miami return with because we had a coupon from an earlier flight we had to cancel. It was just a small amount they gave us back but we thought it's worth it to use it. But after what happened to us on august 2 we will never book with delta again. Our plane was scheduled for 7:02 pm (August 2nd) but then they kept delaying the flight for 3 hours and it kept getting more. Around 8 we saw that other flights would depart earlier then ours (by that time 12:30) so we tried to check if there were other seats available on other planes ! That was the time when we read that the flight got cancelled! We did not get informed by delta nothing! It was not even on the board. So we went to the gate agent to talk with them but the people we talked to didn't understand our situation at all. We literally had to beg them to help us. My boyfriend called the number they gave us to at least get a coupon or anything that could help us out. But nothing. Even when I asked them for blankets they got mad. Just because we didn't want to accept that they are allowed to treat us like that just because the flight got canceled due bad weather conditions in New York. Now was the time we gave up hope and decided to stay next to other people sleeping on the Floor waiting for our flight to depart at 11:10 am! Which means we spent more than 16hours at the airport waiting to fly to Atlanta before we finally got the chance to fly back to New York. In Miami we ended up sleeping on a bench. But the benches there are the hardest I ever sat on so it was pretty much impossible to sleep. I swear that was the first and definitely the last time in my life I fly with delta. Unbelievable - I don't know where the humanity went!"
"""fly with someone else""","✅ Verified Review | Las Vegas to Minneapolis. The people I talked to on the phone had great service. Counter was a different story. My family had a 4 hour layover in Vegas. We asked for boarding pass so we could go out to grab a bite. They guy first said he couldn't until an hour prior to our flight. We had to explain why we needed our pass before he printed our pass. While doing this he made a couple rude statement, ""how many people do you have? Making me work"" are they not here to help? Next time I'll make sure the person is having a good day before asking about my seats. After all said and done everybody is sitting alone. With a group of 14, five are kids. After a second third time talking to him we finally got the kids together. Forget that we checked in early to try to get seats together, forget that we booked together. Next time I'll fly with someone else."
"""my 4th and last reservation with Delta""","✅ Verified Review | This is my 4th and last reservation with Delta. The prior 3 reservations were all late, I missed my connections and had to wait hours for the next plane. The last straw was today 8/14/17. My son is in the military and is coming home on leave. Delta decides to delay a plane with approximately 25 people for 3 hours because ""a flight attendant got lost"". So needless to say, my son missed his first connection, now will miss the second connection (and last flight to Florida by the way) and now has to stay at the airport until the next flight after 8am tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, that is how Delta rewards our men and women who serve in the military."
"""I am hugely disappointed""","✅ Verified Review | Ft Lauderdale to Amsterdam via Atlanta. I am a Diamond Medallion, almost 2 million mile flyer. I have flown Delta forever and stand behind the company as (generally) nearly world-class. On this trip I really needed some help, asked for it, and was ignored by Delta. I flew FLL-ATL-AMS, travelling in Delta One and First Class, connecting in AMS to KLM for onward travel. I bought the flight on Delta.Com and despite have a 1:04 connection time in ATL did not see the timing as a problem. Bad weather in ATL delayed us and, oddly, FLL agents boarded the flight, then unboarded, then immediately reboarded the airplane. While in the terminal waiting to reboard I asked a Redcoat to notify ATL of my close connection and asked for “meet and assist” help upon arrival. I watched him type in the request and listened as he read it to me. We arrived in ATL on an A gate with 24 minutes to spare – my AMS departure was leaving from an E gate. Of course, no one was there to assist and the one gate agent had his hands full with normal gate arrival activities. While running to the connections train I saw on a departures board that the AMS flight, which had been showing on-time on the Delta mobile app, was now delayed 30 minutes. Not sure what to believe I hustled to the E gate, where boarding had not even begun. I am disappointed because on this trip I needed help from Delta and got blown off. As a passenger asking for help I hoped they would step up. I am hugely disappointed in their lack of response. Apparently loyalty is one–way only."
"""Very unpleasant situation""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Miami. Arrived 3 hours early for connecting flight after our KLM flight from Amsterdam. Due to huge line in immigration and security and hardly any staff raced to gate to board for Miami but they closed the doors already. No accommodations, no apology just rude attitude from gate agent. No calling passengers names and flight left missing many passengers from the wait line. Have no idea if luggage made it or not and freezing cold lying on floor amongst all the dust and construction noise. Very unpleasant situation. The KLM flight was little late departing as waiting for late passenger to board and announcing them several times. No such courtesy for us and no courtesy or help at all."
"""representatives were great""","✅ Verified Review | We flew from Detroit, connected in JFK and final destination Punta Cana, upon arrival at the gate at JFK for the connecting flight via Delta we needed to check in at the gate because boarding passes were not available at departure city. The representatives were great and very professional at the JFK gate B22 - very patient and professional and got my and my wife to sit together even though the flight was already boarding upon our arrival at the gate."
"""take pride in their job!""","✅ Verified Review | Boston to Detroit. Big shout out to the gentleman flight attendant who gave the whole plane a Vegas worthy magic show! Made the flight enjoyable and the whole plane was laughing the whole way it was awesome. I hope Delta hires more people like him who really take pride in their job!"
"""will not be flying Delta anymore""","✅ Verified Review | Delta have adopted Spirit Airlines as their business model but they stand behind having room and space for people to operate in, which is false. The service workers are as good as they can be but the policy makers have put all these folks in a bad spot cramming tons of people in tight spaces. Boarding and exiting the plane is unorganized and difficult. Delta are a bad choice if your flight is over 90 minutes long. Leg room is non-existent, even in most of their preferred seating. Long lines in just two bathrooms areas from NYC to San Francisco. Will not be flying Delta anymore."
"""at Delta you get nothing""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Detroit to LaGuardia. This is again an example of cattle transport. Delta had old planes. This one really looked like it was ready for the junk yard. Again, at Delta you get nothing. The seats are totally uncomfortable as well. I was happy to land in New York and have this experience behind me."
"""told me to sleep in the airport""","✅ Verified Review | I was in transit in Minneapolis from Tokyo, in order to go back home in Monreal, on August 5th. My flight has been delayed until August 6th 12h00 pm. The aircraft had a mechanical problem which would be supposed to be fix up during the night. Because I was in transit, I didn't havethe right to go out of the airport to the hotel that was offered by the airline. I was the only customer in this situation, so they managed my problem by giving me a mattress, a pillow and a blanket, and told me to sleep in the airport. I asked if it would be possible to open one of the Delta Lounge for the night, but I was told that it was not possible. I waited 1 hour and a half for the pillow and the blanket. One of the passenger told me that that it was the second cancellation in 2 days for this flight going to Montreal."
"""Avoid this airline for international connections""","✅ Verified Review | Originally supposed to fly Boston to Vienna via Amsterdam. I arrived at terminal A at the airport in Boston at 13.00 for the 16.45 flight. Check-in took longer than it should. I then went to the Delta skyclub lounge and it was dirty. The food was mediocre. You also have to ask an employee for the wifi password. I went to the gate and the flight started boarding at the normal time. Seats were not the most comfortable, even for business class. A crew member rudely forced me to put my passport in the overhead bin rather than in front of me. I never forget stuff on aircrafts! We were just about to depart when the captain told us there was a delay because of a broken air vent in the cockpit that was just discovered. The plane was sitting at that gate all day. Why didn’t they spot the damage when the plane arrived from Amsterdam that morning? First the crew spent 25 minutes trying to fix the vent in the hot sun with no air conditioning allowed, then another 30 minutes talking on the phone with their maintenance HQ, then they told us there would be a delay until 20.30 at night. We were forced to exit the aircraft so they could take it to the hangar. Now we had 300 people with missed connections waiting in line at the help desk with only 2 employees there. The staff acted uncaring and oblivious and many people were getting very angry with them. When I reached the front of the line the Delta customer service staff told me I couldn’t do anything and I was forced to stay on this delayed flight. They didn’t even look at other options! I did not see them look down at their computer screens when I asked them about re-booking. They probably just want my money. They never updated us on the repair progress but the flight was now delayed until 23.00. At that point I wouldn’t make it back to Austria for another 2 days. I called my travel agent and they successfully rebooked me on a 22.15 Lufthansa flight through Frankfurt. It was on time and everything about that airline (lounge and aircraft) was so much better than Delta! I arrived in Vienna 5 hours later than expected. I later found out the Delta flight to Amsterdam was eventually cancelled. Avoid this airline for international connections!"
"""never be flying Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | My flight was supposed to be such a short trip, that is why I chose to fly instead of drive from Seattle to Spokane. Both flights were majorly delayed on my trip and it defeated the purpose of flying. In addition to that, it seemed very prominent with the crew that this is a regular thing. When I go onto the plane, the overhead bins barely fit my carry on purse. I had to fly with my carry on underneath my feet. With all the delay and keeping us at the airport so long, you think they would at least hand out pretzels or water. Nope. Terrible schedule and service. I will never be flying Delta again. Should have flown Alaska. They had a Spokane to Seattle flight scheduled for later than mine - that arrived in Seatac before my Delta flight did."
"""communication is poor""","✅ Verified Review | I missed my connecting flight with Delta due to an electrical storm. Although that is not the airline's fault, the fact that I had less than 5 minutes to get to my other plane and the crew did not ask for people who were not connecting to wait to disembark so those of us that needed to run could make our connections. Atlanta is a big airport and of course the connecting plane was on the opposite side of the terminal. Once making it to the connecting gate, the customer service representative chuckled when she told the 4 people, that needed that plane, ""yes, that's your plane pulling away"". I slept in the terminal because the next available flight was 9 hours later. Gate changed at least 3 times. I am writing this as I sit on the plane they rebooked me on, supposedly getting ready to go, but actually has sat at the gate with all passengers for over an hour because the underground fuel tanks aren't working. Needless to say, my connecting flight has now been delayed by 1.5 hours. My main complaints are that the desk people are rude and the communication is poor. The airport is dirty."
"""no apologies at all""","✅ Verified Review | Boston to Charlottesville via La Guardia. Worst airline experience! Both my flights (BOS-LGA delayed from 7pm to 8:30pm and LGA-CHO delayed from 9 pm to 11 pm) were delayed by couple of hours which was fine and understood - but just 30 mins before my 2nd flight (at 8:30 for LGA-CHO) they emailed me that the 2nd leg of the flight will be on time and the first flight won't reach on time for me to even think about rushing and getting to gate to try to make it. Cherry on the cake they did not even wait for few passengers going to CHO and said you are scheduled for next afternoon now via Atlanta - so basically by the time I reach my final destination it will be 7pm of next day. By the way, no apologies at all during the whole 24 hrs process. Will never fly Delta!"
"""All good works of the flight crew destroyed""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Delta Air Lines from Nashville to Salt Lake City. Flight crew were great. When I arrived late to make my connecting flight the gate attendent told me there was no room. Gave us a $100.00 voucher and said they would supply us with pillows and blankets. We were apparently welcome to sleep anywhere in the airport. $100.00 is compensation really? Apparently if look around there are flat benches. All good works of the flight crew destroyed."
"""totally inconvenient and frustrating""","✅ Verified Review | Purchased an international flight through KLM, flying from New Orleans to Atlanta and then to Amsterdam. The first flight is so far 45 minutes late, and I'm worried about being able to catch my second flight. They are having technical difficulties with electricity, and it's totally inconvenient and frustrating."
"""no regret, not sorry so nothing""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Seattle to Austin. I bought this ticket weeks ago and was given seat 21 D. When I arrived to check in the terminal would not accept my ID so I waited in line for special services for 57 minutes once I looked at my watch. Only 3, sometimes 4 staff were around to take care of a long line. When I checked in I found that there was no seat for me. The excuse being that there was a change of equipment. However since there was a 21 D on this plane what difference is that? I was offerred the back row in exchange, no regret, not sorry, so nothing. Then I was told by this astonshing gate man that If I was nice he would not lose interest in helping me. Is this behaviour going to be allowed go forward?"
"""Customer service is just horrible""","✅ Verified Review | Barcelona to New York JFK on 15th July. The flight was delayed by 3 hours and the crew was rude. I was with my 9 year old son and we were sitting on seats 54H/54J. I requested the Flight attendant working that section guy to help me put my bag up on the storage and he said we are here to assist and not help - very rude and obnoxious. Customer service at Delta in general is just horrible."
"""unprofessional and careless company""","✅ Verified Review | Delta flight from West Palm beach to La Guardia was delayed since 1 PM. Now they announced that we might take off at 7 PM. If you do the math that's 6 hours of wasted personal time and unnecessary inconvenience. I promised myself to never fly with Delta ever again! Worst experience with this unprofessional and careless company."
"""attempt to never fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Greensboro to London via Atlanta. Complaints sent to Delta for reference to anybody misguided enough to think of flying with them. 3 flights on delta in 3 days, each flight significantly delayed, due to incompetence at a level I have never experienced before, including over an hour to load freight that arrived late, and gate staff posting an hour delay resulting in passengers leaving the gate then scrambling to get them back to the gate. Three flights overbooked, incredible. And to add insult to an already desperately bad service the cabin staff closed one of the two business toilets twice, once after service and once just before landing for ""staff use"" and I was told to either wait 5 minutes because staff have priority or join a growing queue of paying passengers. I will attempt to never fly Delta again."
"""fix this attitude""","✅ Verified Review | New York LaGuardia to Sarasota. I was waiting to board and looked out the window and saw a Delta baggage handler throw each bag from the baggage truck onto the bag escalator. He was an able bodied young man- why does he need to throw the bags?? It shows a great disrespect and carelessness, and is not representative of the Delta I know and like. Please fix this attitude."
"""making my experience horrible""","✅ Verified Review | The flight was delayed in Paris for 4 hours plus the 3 hours layover so 7 hours, then we came to New York and that's where the worst happened. The flight was delayed three times then was canceled, and no hotels for us. I had to spend the night and the day there sleeping on the floor next to the exit of the airport cause they won't let you enter to the gate. I arrived to San Francisco I waited 1 hour to collect my baggage and I found out that they only sent one - the other one is hanging out in New York. Thank you delta for making my experience horrible."
"""very poor customer service""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Keflavik. Flight DL446 was scheduled at 9PM July 13, ended up departing 11:13AM the next day. It was delayed hour after hour, first notification of delay was at around 6:30PM that it was delayed to 10:05PM, then 5 minutes later told it is delayed to 11:15PM, then 12:15AM, 1:02, 1:32, 1:50, 2:30 and finally 7AM (this delay was announced at 2:20AM). I decided to cancel and refund my ticket at 2:30AM and just leave as I was going to Reykjavik for the weekend and it would have been a waste. Thankfully the Delta hotline accepted the refund and told I was to receive my money in one week (we'll see how that goes) and that I had to go to baggage service desk in JFK to claim my bag. I filed a baggage request form and was told that it will be delivered to my house in Manhattan by 3:30PM and that the baggage employees arrive at 5:40AM (I had to wait 2.5hrs at least). I had already been at the airport for 8 hours so did not want to wait. Well, now I regret it. Bag never left the plane and boarded the flight to Reykjavik. Not sure how that happened. On July 14, hotline employee told me that it will board the next flight (DL246 KEF-JFK on July 15). I said no problem and did not mind the wait, and I handled this all calmly even though almost all my belongings are in that bag as I am in NY for a few weeks only. I call again today (July 15) and the bag is still in Reykjavik and employee is not sure when it will come back to NY. Honestly I do not mind waiting but to be promised to receive the bag on a day and then for it not to happen not once, but twice, is very poor customer service. After 8 hours in the airport and cancelling my trip, not having my bag with me is the last thing I would want to happen. Also, every single time I called them (at least 6 times so far), I waited at least 20 to 25 minutes on hold before someone picked up."
"""rude and arrogant staff""","✅ Verified Review | Cleveland to Amsterdam via Atlanta. Really really horrible customer service at their own hub airport in Atlanta. Flight delayed due to their maintenance issue, connection missed and they treat you like you're some annoying homeless person and at first tell you to go to 5 different places, then when you're at the right place, you are not allowed to ask a question without standing first in line for 4 hours (yes 4 hours starting at 12 am) when you get to the counter you're being told that they won't help you because some system error airline didn't release the ticket and they will wait until 8 am when the airline opens at their airport. You're not getting a hotel because they have none available from their partners! So they expect you to ""hang-around"" for 20 hours after already traveling for long to wait for your flight giving you a 15$ voucher for food! This is the most ridiculous service I've ever experienced. When I summed up the fact that they made me wait in line for 4 hours to tell me they won't help me, they denied ever telling me to stand in the line. Very rude and arrogant staff. Last thing you want to experience on a long journey. Avoid Delta at all costs."
"""flight attendants absolutely fantastic""","✅ Verified Review | Dallas Ft Worth to Salt Lake City. This is about the flight attendants on this flight. They were absolutely fantastic. I got extremely ill midway through the flight and they were ready and willing to help with whatever I needed: ginger ale, ice pack for my neck, snacks to settle my stomach. I spent most of my flight standing in the back in case and one of the women talked to me and helped take my mind off of how I was feeling. I am so grateful to those flight attendants. I'd fly Delta again simply because of them."
"""had a fantastic experience""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Orlando. We had a fantastic experience with Delta. My husband and I flew for the first time ever to get to our honeymoon cruise out of Orlando. Delta made the entire experience so easy and stress-free. They made sure we knew exactly where to go every step of the way, and we got to our gate plenty early. The flight attendants were kind and very helpful. We got to enjoy a snack and a drink on our flights to Orlando and back home. And the TV screens with games and movies made our flight home even more enjoyable. We are so grateful to Delta for making our first flying experience absolutely perfect, and we look forward to flying with them in the future."
"""was surprised with Delta""","✅ Verified Review | Tokyo Narita to Detroit on the Boeing 747-400. First time flying with Delta Air Lines and having very low expectations with US carriers, I was surprised with Delta. The food, IFE, and ameneties provided were much better than expected. The two veteran crew serving my side were really friendly and interactive with passengers. The crew on the opposite aisle were grumpy and not smiling."
"""incompetence and indifference""","✅ Verified Review | La Guardia to Cincinnati. I paid a little extra to go with Delta over typical budget airlines, what a mistake! I flown with a dozen or so airlines over the years, and never have I encountered the level of a incompetence and indifference than from the staff of Delta. Not only did the plane arrive 30 minutes late but the stewardesses for the flight arrived an hour past when the flight was scheduled because they were both on separate flights that were also late somehow. Why would you schedule staff to work on one plane when there still in the air working on other plane? This is ridiculous! And this was on a clear summer day, not a winter blizzard. Also, while trying to exchange my tickets weeks in advance because my travel dates changed they resorted to outright extortion. They said they would it cost me $200 per ticket to exchange them for flights that were selling from their own website for $106 each. When I told them that I could just buy new tickets for almost half the price of exchanging them they then told me that they would void my return ticket even though I wasn't trying to chang the return trip. Delta's service is far worse that even the cheapest of the budget airlines. I will never fly with Delta again."
"""the worst travel experience of my life""","✅ Verified Review | I will never be flying on Delta Air Lines again. We arrived at the gate to find out our flight from Fort Lauderdale to New York JFK was delayed 2 hours due to air traffic in the Washington area. 2 hours later and there is still too much traffic to fly through Washington so we had to change routes to go around. Great idea if only they had the brains to think of this sooner. Now we are finally on the runway and they just realized that the flight time would be longer due to the new route. Turns out we don't have enough fuel. So back to the gate we go. This has been the worst travel experience of my life. To add to it all they ""ran out"" of headphones. I have already been at this airport/on the plane for 6 hours and we are still at the gate. Will we ever make it to New York? Not sure."
"""truly appalling experience""","✅ Verified Review | One of the worst experience ever with Delta. I have never had to deal with such unfriendly and unprofessional crew in a long haul flight (Sydney to Los Angeles). At lunch time, the flight attendant literally threw the food platter on my tray telling me ""that's pasta and that's what's left"". The rest of the crew set a mood of intimidation, unfriendliness and brashness. Not one smile, not one courteous gesture: plain rude. I was very surprised to witness that such service would still exist nowadays: a real horror story. We even requested to talk to the cabin manager to lodge a complaint but Delta does not even have a crew manager on board (or so were we told as they might back up each other). A truly appalling experience."
"""will be our last choice for flying going forward""","✅ Verified Review | Staff are completely unprofessional. We have flown with our baby multiple times and purchase her a seat even though it is not necessary until they are two. The flight attendants on this trip flying from Montana to Phoenix via Salt Lake City have been terrible - they are completely rude and have to awareness of how to cater to family travelers. The flight attendants tried to make us check our car seat multiple times even though the manufacturer website clearly shows the seat is airline approved. Also we have a Chico key fit 30 which is one of the most popular car seats sold and I would hope before trying to make us check it unnecessarily they would be up to date on the most commonly approved seats. A child can sit in a lap with no seat so I do not see the issue for what seat is traveled with. After throwing a big fuss over our seat and getting management involved and all the other passengers involved telling them it is approved they finally with disgruntled looks on their faces ""let"" us use the seat as an exception! They acted like they were doing a favor by not having us check the seat when it is clearly approved on the website. I am disgusted to pay for a seat and be treated this way as if they are doing us a courtesy. It is completely ridiculous and needless to say Delta will be our last choice for flying going forward."
"""recommend flying on Delta""","✅ Verified Review | Edmonton to Seattle. The flight was delayed for 5 hours. That was the worst part. We were promptly notified that there was a technical issue with the plane and that there would initially be a 30 minute delay. After 30 minutes we had to deplane. The flight crew was professional and extremely helpful. As soon as we got off the plane they were already distributing snacks, drinks, coloring books for the kids, and also some playing cards. Throughout the ordeal the station attendants were helpful, even when passenger tensions were rising, they remained professional. They even helped some passengers with connecting flights and got them on another flight. After the delay the flight crew were amazing. The pilots got out of the cockpit and addressed everyone face-to-face and apologized for the long delay, which to me showed a high sense of professionalism. The free alcoholic drinks in premium economy were excellent. The snacks were suffice for a short 60 minute flight, just some cookies and pretzels. The seats were highly comfortable and had excellent recline as well. There was no seatback entertainment, however, there were magazines provided. I highly recommend flying on Delta, they know how to treat their customers well."
"""unprofessional attitude of staff""","✅ Verified Review | London to New York. The flight was delayed by at least two hours due to inclement weather which you could understand and deal with but not unprofessional attitude of the staff. Actually it was just one member who proceeded on three, yes three occasions to ignore me while giving out drinks. Once for a cup of tea, again passed over when offering a bottle of water twice! I get that they need to stretch across to take the window seat person's tray but no excuse me, nothing! One other thing was just before boarding it seemed a little chaotic as people were lining up and did not know which line or where it seemed to be going. The staff were waving you here there and everywhere. Perhaps putting large print signs with more concise info would be more helpful. Though the rating is on the low side, I would recommend this airline as my London to New York trip went fine but return one not so much."
"""incredibly unprofessional""","✅ Verified Review | Zurich to New York JFK. After having a horrible experience departing with Delta back on June 21, 2017, when I returned to JFK, I went through customs and monitored the electronic board for the carousel for baggage. Plane landed at 1:12pm, and at 2:10 the baggage was still not listed. Finally, a number of us started asking various employees who would walk by (almost always not a Delta employee but an airport one), and finally someone said ""The board is not correct. Wait for an announcement."" Eventually we were told the bags had been already out on Carousel 4 (and there were dozens of flights from Delta and other carriers, with hundreds if not thousands of people in the whole area). Disgusting, and incredibly unprofessional. We need in the USA to follow Europe and punish airlines when they screw us over."
"""terrible customer service""","✅ Verified Review | I was on a Delta flight from Chicago to Los Angeles with a connection at Minneapolis. I had a horrible experience. The layover time was 30 mins, which I knew to be risky because it includes the time it takes to deboard a plane. We landed on time (1 minute early) and the race began. A Delta employee gives me the gate number but doesn't tell me that the connecting gate was at the other end of the terminal and would take a 10 minute walk! Regardless, I arrive at the gate before 30 mins (it took me maybe 28 minutes) but I was told I couldn't board because the airplane door was closed. I was not offered an apology. To make things worse, I had talked to a Delta employee on my way to the gate and asked them to call the delta employees at the connecting gate and let them know that I am on my way. That was the last flight to LA of the day, and I had to sleep on the ground because I wasn't offered a hotel. I took another flight the next day, which fortunately was half empty. Other than the terrible customer service, the plane was clean. However, the wifi wasn't working. We got the standard minimal beverages and some peanuts."
"""check to book with Delta first""","✅ Verified Review | Washington to Los Angeles. Thanks Delta. My boyfriend and I will check to book with Delta first for the air excellent choice they give customer's - complimentary light dinner with 3 or 4 great choices, as well as snacks and beverage choices. We enjoyed the free headphones with a large selection of the latest movies and television shows, each seat has it's own tv. My boyfriend stated he is getting Delta Credit Card to earn flying points as well. Delta, thank you for treating us like human beings and not a cash machine. You stand out from the airlines want to nickel and dime and treat their customers as cash machines instead of human beings."
"""I will choose Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Orlando was the best short haul flight I've taken. Cabin crew were friendly, casual but efficient. I was amazed by the retrofitted cabin design and how bright it was. Overhead bin was massive and a carry-on suitcase could fit sitting on the side of the suitcase instead of flat as they normally do. I appreciated when the crew kindly reminded every passenger to get to their seat as soon as possible and move away from the aisle to speed up the boarding process, since we started boarding a few minutes behind the scheduled boarding time but arrived in Orlando 20min early. The entertainment system was very amazing and it's even better than those on long haul international flights. Big screen and a lot of movies to choose from. Free non-alcoholic beverage and snack is a common practice in US domestics flights. I will choose Delta again."
"""wonderful customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Wonderful customer service. The customer service staff who serviced flight Delta 2414 from Las Vegas to Seattle on 22 June 2017 was amazing. This gentleman was polite and professional and was absolutely funny. I was also amazed that the pilot who was standing at the counter also spoke and joked with customers waiting for seat allocation. This is very refreshing and cool. The special treatment continued on the flight with very friendly flight attendants. The snacks provided on this domestic flight is better than what you get on a premium airline in Australia. I am very impressed with the service from all levels. Keep up the good work Delta. My family and I will definitely fly with Delta again."
"""try and never use them""","✅ Verified Review | Detroit to Washington Dulles. Very disappointed in Delta Air Lines and will be canceling delta credit card. We were delayed multiple times by weather related incident to then be told we would be flying when the plane arrives to then be told the flight was canceld as we waited until 1:30 to be told. Waiting around for nothing when we could have been told earlier and either went home or got a hotel and rebooked. Why wait until 1:30am. No compensation or credit or hotel to stay in nothing. Things happen, but to not be taken care of for nothing is a little absurd. Statistics show that if you stayed at a hotel and had an ok experience you would most likely not stay at that hotel. If you had a bad experience, but the staff took care of and made that experience right you would go back at a much higher rate. If only Delta would have done the smallest thing I would def use them again. I will now try and never use them if I have the chance. Thanks Delta, hello Southwest"
"""crew were exceptional""","✅ Verified Review | Dublin to Seattle via Boston. Amazing service from this flight. The crew were exceptional. There was a man that needed medical attention in the back of the plane and the crew asked overhead if any nurses or doctors could come back. I am an critical care nurse in Seattle, so both me and my sister (also a nurse in Seattle) went back to help. We spent about 15 minutes back there with the man (who turned out okay), but they took our seat numbers in case he needed any more medical attention. Later on in the flight, a flight attendant came by to take our name, email address and home address so that they could give us each a $100 voucher for our services. I was so touched. Delta was kind enough to not only express their gratitude but to give us a reward. Delta was already one of my favorite airlines because of the quality of the flights as well as the entertainment selection, but now they truly are my favorite airline."
"""the service was professional""","✅ Verified Review | An early morning start at Dulles, check in was very smooth and boarding was orderly, the aircraft was old but the service was very good arrival at Atlanta was on time. Delta attendants at arrival were very helpful and courteous, our connection at Atlanta was distant, we had to go from terminal C all the way to terminal F and our flight to Honolulu was on time. We boarded an older A330-300, from it's registration number it was one of the old Northwest Airlines aircraft, but the layout of the Business First is the latest Delta product. Delta have an excellent record of their upkeep of their aircraft even if they are very old. The entertainment system worked well but the food was very poor. Again the service was professional and top notch. Arrival in Honolulu was ahead of time and we had a great view of the Big Island and Maui and towards landing we saw beautiful Waikiki."
"""Had nothing but problems""","✅ Verified Review | Had nothing but problems on this trip with Delta Air Lines. Flight from Tucson was cancelled delaying trip for a day. On the way back we had 2 stops. Flight from Portland delayed, no reason given. Flight in Seattle delayed, no reason given, which made us late for final leg of trip out of LA. Although plane to Tucson was still on the ground they would not let us board. The airline provided a hotel room. However, it took over 2 hours to get luggage and to the hotel room despite hotel being less than 2 miles from the airport. Returned the following day to fly to Tucson. Gate agent missing, total chaos, and plane left late."
"""no information was given""","✅ Verified Review | I had a flight from Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta and connecting flight from Atlanta to Virginia. ""Due to weather"" we were in the air for an hour on which I got left behind from my connecting flight. I got to the gate at 10.30 and the flight was departing at 10.40 and the plane left early. I was left behind in an airport and city I don't know. I proceeded to the gate where Delta employees were ""helping"" customers, but in reality they weren't. One employee started yelling at a customer for not standing in a single file line. After waiting for almost an hour to see if I could catch another flight to my final destination, I finally got to the counter and the delta employee was rude, not helpful and wasn't listening to my needs. All he offered was a flight the next day at 12.07 pm and told me if I didn't like it I could get on the phone and find an alternative. So I got on the phone with a Delta representative, explained my situation and she wasn't helpful either. I asked to be put on a flight with the partner airline that was leaving that same night and her response was no. After being on the phone for 45 mins all I got was a flight from atl to Norfolk at 7am. I got to Norfolk at 9.05 so had missed my interview and was also one hour and 30 mins from from my destination. I am not pleased at all with the way Delta managed the situation. On top of all that my connecting flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale got delayed by 2 hours and no information was given on why it was delayed. Needless to say I will not recommend or flight with Delta again!"
"""invest fixing their airplanes""","✅ Verified Review | Kansas City to La Guardia. Horrible experience. Delta should definitely invest more of their budget fixing their airplanes. Sunday I traveled with them out of LGA and because of technical issues flight was delayed 3 hours, then the excuse was that the flight was overbooked and eight people had to leave the plane. Finally today after hours of delay because of technical issues, the flight was cancelled with no more flights available until tomorrow."
"""attendants need to shut up""","✅ Verified Review | Washington to West Palm Beach via Atlanta. Just got off a flight where the flight attendants talked on the intercom almost the whole flight. And the volume was so loud my ears are ringing and I have a pounding headache. Never before have I been on such an annoying flight where you couldn't relax, rest, watch a movie, or read because of the incessant talking on the overhead announcer speaker about nothing. When we got off the plane, the person I was traveling with expressed the same frustration. The flights attendants need to shut up! I would much rather fly Southwest where you can actually enjoy your flight!"
"""Crew polite, helpful and professional""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Tampa to Raleigh-Durham. Kudos to Delta for going above and beyond. I bought tickets three months in advance for my mother and I to attend my nephew's graduation assuming prices would start to rise after that. To my surprise, fares lowered dramatically a few weeks after my purchase. I had originally purchased ""Main Economy"" tickets, Delta's middle tier in economy. Upon seeing the new lower prices, I called Delta who offered to upgrade us to Delta Comfort+, their top tier in economy which offers more legroom, advance boarding and guaranteed overhead bin space. The ticket price of the upgraded seats was lower than what I had paid for Main Economy and Delta's response was to issue each of us the $49 fare difference in vouchers for future travel (which we will definitely use this year before expiry) even though they were under no obligation to do so. My mother requires wheelchair assistance and this was handled flawlessly on both ends of both flights. Both flights left slightly late but arrived on time on the outbound and early on the return. Outbound seat very uncomfortable, return was fine. We had ""bulkhead"" seats both ways on these regional flights and as there is no wall separating First and Economy we were able to stow belongings under the First seat in front of us avoiding the bulkhead inconvenience of having to stow everything in the overhead. Crew polite, helpful and professional on both flights. On the return crew pilfered First snacks in order to provide my mother with a nut and seed free option. WiFi was provided though I did not attempt to use it so cannot comment on speed. If Delta continues to provide this level of service I will continue to fly with them."
"""disgusted by the way Delta treat customers""","✅ Verified Review | Manchester to Boston via New York. I am disgusted by the way Delta treat their customers. My wife and I booked through Virgin a return flight Manchester to Boston via New York. Besides the flight being cancelled from New York to Boston their staff were non existent. We arrived in New York delayed but with a time that was tight as you have to go through security and immigration. After panicking a little we found the flight was delayed. We set off to the boarding gate. I am disabled and require a mobility scooter to get around so I was waiting patiently for Delta member of staff to check us out as usual. This never happened. To cut a long story short the flight while we sat waiting was delayed four time was coming from two different Airports and then cancelled. We were directed by an announcement that we had to go to a certain area in the airport to ascertain what to do next. We arrived at the named area and there was a queue. After waiting for about thirty minutes a staff member came out and said that we should go to another area. This we did it was a long way to go we reached the area and again a queue - after about thirty minutes we got to the desk. I iterated to the staff member that we had been travelling for over 20 hours and I was very sore. The staff member asked my wife to go around the back to look at the screen. I was unable to and also never asked to. The staff member was showing my wife that we were entitled to a hotel because I was disabled. I find this distasteful as surely anyone delayed due to the airline failings were entitled. Anyway we asked how we should get there and produced a voucher for a taxi. We were then told how to get to the taxi stand. I asked about our bags as my medication was in there. We were told to go to another office which was baggage claim. On arriving there we asked about the bags and we were refused. We went to the taxi stand and tried to find the taxi company asking one of the drivers he was not easy to understand he said it was his taxi. I was put in the back by means of ramps and I only just got in. The taxi driver did not know where the hotel was my wife caught a glimpse of it and showed it to the driver. Arriving at the hotel he wanted another voucher for the return journey next day. We did not have one. We ordered a taxi through the hotel, as I could not go through that again costing $40. Arriving at JFK we proceeded to the gate and guess what another delay. I thought here we go again. At the new take off time an hour delay there was further discussion as to how they would handle my mobility scooter and after one member of staff who seemed to be the group leader refusing to load it as they had not been trained. After a long discussion I was allowed to go to the Aircraft doors and my scooter was taken away. My thoughts were I was never going to see it again. I was directed to a seat,which was difficult to get in due to my disability and then found my wife was seated elsewhere. We arrived at Boston and went to retrieve our cases and found they were not there. My wife thought she spotted them some way from the area and sure enough it was them. We were then told that they had come on an earlier flight. It would of been helpful and customer focused to tell us that in the beginning The return flight was also a nightmare but I am not in mood to go on as it gets me more angry by the thought of it"
"""very pleased with Delta""","✅ Verified Review | I had a family emergency and had to cancel my Washington to Akron via Detroit flight 18 hours prior to take off. I notified Delta customer service of my situation and with no questions asked, they cancelled my flight and awarded me with a full credit. I'm very pleased with Delta and their graciousness towards myself. They gave me one less thing to worry about. I definitely will go out of my way to fly only Delta in the future."
"""staff chose to ignore me standing there""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Delta from Chicago to New York. Seats are assigned at the gate. Multiple staff members present at the gate however staff chose to ignore me standing there. At my second attempt to asked whether I could be seated next to my husband the staff member barely made eye contact with me and did not offer to assist with this query. I witness other people's queries being answered rudely. Extremely unprofessional service for an airline. I will not be flying with this company in future."
"""service was efficient and pleasant""","✅ Verified Review | Delta continues to be the best of the American legacy airlines. Check-in at Barcelona was easy and the gentleman who printed our boarding passes and took our baggage was very personable and made us feel very welcome. Business class seating was fine and service was efficient and pleasant. IFE was fine and I was able to watch two current movies during my flight. Food was fine and water and beverages available throughout the flight. Overall the flight was a pleasant experience."
"""FAs were swift and attentive""","✅ Verified Review | Delta Air Lines flight from Paris to Newark was smooth and pleasant. Efficient boarding, take off on time. Very good food: both meals and ice cream and bottle of water in between. FAs were swift and attentive. IFE with a very broad selection of movies/programs. The only downside was a quite old aircraft with all related issues (loose panels, exposed repaired details, drafts in the cabin), but the seat (economy) was surprisingly comfortable. I think Delta would gain many more credits with a newer fleet on the long range flights. In general very good impression. With 2 points subtracted for the aircraft cabin condition, I definitely recommend Delta for trans-atlantic travel."
"""never fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Seattle. The flight was delayed due to a flight attendant being late from another flight. When many of us passengers who were taking connecting flights voiced our concerns about missing our flights to the flight attendants we were ensured that we would reach or something would be done. We arrived in Seattle at 1050 which was approx 30 minutes later than expecting. Due to my connecting flight being on the complete other side of the huge airport I missed my flight, along with many others. Then I was told that although I was supposed to be on a connecting flight I could still get my bags at SeaTac but of course my bags were already at my final destination. It was absolutely horrible!! I would never fly Delta again."
"""continues to employ overbooking""","✅ Verified Review | Delta continues to employ overbooking. As I was flying out of New York to Austin, I was preparing to board when I watched the harried gate agent begin the begging process for anyone willing to give up their seat on the early flight for a guaranteed seat 10 hours later. We were told after the flight had left that we would receive an email explaining the process for receiving our compensation in ""about 30 minutes."" That was Friday - today is Monday - no email. I would think Delta would learn that bad press is to be avoided - but maybe you are functioning on the premise that any press is good press."
"""Delta hates families?""","✅ Verified Review | Shannon to Columbus via New York. My family and I flew internationally and Delta refused to move us to an earlier connecting flight, despite the fact that we had plenty of time and they told us the earlier flight had plenty of seats. To make us even more mad, they said ""if it was one of you we could do it, but not for a family."" So, I can only conclude that Delta hates families? Or they're just lazy? I'm mad that I have to sit in the airport for 6 more hours. How is Delta so stupid? Now there are less seats on the later flight to possibly sell, and they just chose to anger five international travelers who have families of their own. Way to simultaneously screw your customers and yourself, Delta. We won't be back. I gave them a 1/10 instead of a 0/10 because the flight crew on our first leg of the trip was great."
"""treated well by every member staff""","✅ Verified Review | I can't express how wonderfully Delta has treated me and my family during this time of need. My father passed away suddenly and I needed a bereavement rate. They provided it with ease, saving my two sons $600 each over the price of another carrier. On the plane, they offered a selection of snacks including Kind bars which were a great alternative to pretzels. I was treated well by every member staff. I can't say enough about how great Delta is. When I fly in the future my choice will be Delta."
"""could not reach all their customers""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Delta Air Lines from Atlanta to Toronto. I have been flying for years, never before have I had such a bad experience as this one. Not only did they run out of space to put away my small carry-on luggage but, they also could not reach all their customers with drinks and food. This will probably be the last time I fly with Delta. Having a delayed flight is normal but, with all these other factors that went into the poor flight, this will have to be the last time."
"""Very uncomfortable""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Detroit to Las Vegas with Delta Air Lines. Very uncomfortable. I thought since this was a bigger plane, that the seats would be larger. Nope. The airline staff also skipped over me during the snacks and beverages. This is also the only flight in which I got a terrible headache from the sound of the plane. Lastly, the headrest video/music player did not work well enough to be able to watch or listen to much. Big disappointment."
"""changed and delayed 3 times""","✅ Verified Review | Boston to Atlanta. Still waiting at the airport, my flight was changed and delayed 3 times, all they blame is on Boston Logan airport, due to construction. Don't they know in advance the going construction ? And change their flights in advance too we been waiting here for 6 hours and Delta is not doing anything for us, worst customer service."
"""an excellent experience""","✅ Verified Review | Excellent flight from Rome to New York on Delta Air Lines. Check in at Rome was fast and efficient. The Business Class seat was extremely comfortable. The cabin staff and service was excellent, friendly and polite. The IFE had several choices between music, movies, ant TV. The inflight meals and beverages were outstanding with ample choices. This was an excellent experience with Delta and I will be happy to fly with them again in the future."
"""They have won my loyalty""","✅ Verified Review | Honolulu to Singapore via Narita. Two wonderful flights proving American carriers can give equal or better service if they choose. Lounges, seats, staff, entertainment were all as close to perfect as it gets. Crews were different but very friendly and efficient on both legs. Bravo to Delta for picking up their game. They have won my loyalty."
"""employee amazingly patient and caring""","✅ Verified Review | Minneapolis to Iron Mountain. My flight was cancelled and the Delta employee was amazingly patient and caring with figuring out the best route for each person on the cancelled flight. People were crying and upset but she held it together and did not get frustrated with anyone. She did an outstanding job and probably deserves to be paid way more than she is being paid. On the flight that I got switched to, all the staff were equally as helpful and patient. Delta hires good employees and this counts them as a trustworthy company in my opinion. If you have flight problems, Delta will take care of you well."
"""demonstrated bad business practice""","✅ Verified Review | Richmond to Johannesburg via Atlanta. I was very disappointed with Delta Airlines, I booked my ticket to Zimbabwe on January 28th, 2017 for a trip in May 2017. I purchased separately a Delta Comfort seat for an additional total of $418 because I knew the 16 hour non stop flight to and from ATL to JNB was long. This reservation was done over the phone since I needed the assistance of a Delta agent to book a ticket from JNB to HRE and from HRE to JNB. When it came to checking in 24 hours prior to my trip on the 1st of May, the online system would not let me check in online. I had to call a Delta agent to assist with checking in. After being on the phone for over an hour, the agent had to redo my reservation under a new record locator and confirmation number. According to this agent, the reason why it would not let me check in was because there was a Date of Birth mismatch. The agent assured me that my seating remained intact, and just the confirmation had changed. I was finally able to check in. When boarding at RIC airport, all of a sudden, the agent gave me a new seat number which was NOT the original seat number I reserved. When I arrived in ATL, my boarding pass wouldn't scan. I was supposed to board with the SKY priority zone, but could not. I was supposed to be on seat 31F which was a delta comfort seat. The agent told me that they were checking to see if my luggage had transferred to the flight. I thought that was an odd response. All of a sudden, I have a new boarding pass with a new seat number 53E and they just reassigned me with no notice or explanation. I located the seat thinking it was another Delta Comfort seat, but it my dismay, it was a basic economy class seat. I reported this mix up immediately to one of the stewardess. She got the agent that reassigned my seat. This agent claimed they did not have a record of my purchasing economy comfort seat, yet it was on the documentation that I presented to him. I insisted that I wanted my original seat back, but of course he was totally unwilling to help or do anything to look into it.He totally disregarded me and ignored everything i had to say and walked away. Now, I was told to take the economy seat as there were not delta comfort seats available as the plane was getting ready to takeoff. I had no choice but to do so. As a delta skymiles member, I was lied to by these agents and was very disrespected. If Skymiles members are treated this way and based on this experice, I will certainly cancelling my skymiles membership and delta gold credit card after being treated like trash. I also will not be recommending delta as customer service oriented airline. In my opinion, Delta demonstrated bad business practice, by relinquishing my comfort seat when it was already paid for. How do you loose a comfort seat which should have been secured for by payment?"
"""would have expected better""","✅ Verified Review | Fort Lauderdale to Richmond. I'm very disappointed with Delta Air Lines. You should not have to pay extra to bring luggage and to pick a seat on the plane. The lady picking seat assignments was very rude when I was trying to ask questions. Both of my flights were delayed do to Flight attendance not being on time. I will never book with this company again. A 6 hour trip turned into 8. I would have expected better for a company I paid more for."
"""I am disappointed""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Miami. My husband and I purchased plane tickets for our honeymoon roughly 7 months ago for this flight. We were just married two weeks ago and we have plans to spend a week in the East Caribbean. We purchased economy tickets with Delta Airlines because, as one would expect, we were on a close budget while saving for the wedding. We followed up with check in procedure, signing in to schedule our seating at 4:33pm, 24 hours before our flight. The check in opened at 4:30pm on May 18th. 3 minutes into check in all of the seats were booked. So on our honeymoon we are having to sit separately. My husband then called Delta Airlines and spoke to a representative that stated it was a full flight, and for us to speak to the front desk representative at our terminal for accommodations. We arrive at the airport today and waited in line. After hearing an announcement stating that there are several unassigned seats currently and not to worry, that a seat assignment would be given to the individuals when they board the plane. When we did our check in yesterday we had a choice of 2 separate individual seats rows apart from each other even though we booked our tickets 7 whole months in advance. The representative greeted us when we came up to the desk and let us know that no accommodations would be made for our situation even though it was a special occasion for us. She brushed us off and asked us to please take a seat. I am dissappointed. We recently flew with Delta earlier this year and I was highly impressed with their level of organization and professionalism. We travelled with our family of 14 people and were able to book 3 full rows of seats for our whole family with no issues. I am sad on the first day of our trip that no accommodations could have been made for my new husband and I when we followed procedure and planned so meticulously. We are boarding the plane now."
"""be sticking with Delta""","❎ Unverified | Little Rock to Flint. As a mother traveling with a 3 year old and 5 month old, I had a stroller and bags/carry on. The Delta staff was so helpful. Carried my bags to my seat. My connecting flight they moved my seat so I could have more room with the kids. I had flown other airlines recently instead of Delta. But after this experience I will be sticking with Delta from now on."
"""Thank you Delta Air Lines""","✅ Verified Review | May 11th 2017 DL1218, Atlanta to Los Angeles. Great service from three flight attendants who handled a medical emergency on board. Passenger behind me had a seizure and they were calm, listened to my direction (I'm a RN) and very professional. Thank you Delta Air Lines."
"""Slept on the floor of JFK Airport""","✅ Verified Review | Boise to Dublin via New York. Had to get home for my grannys funeral, spent $1175.78 for the ticket. Trip from Dublin to Boise all was fine. On way back, left Boise to Salt Lake City, told there was going to be just over an hour delay, I asked at the Delta desk, will I make my connector at JFK to Dublin, was told yes. Left SLC about 30 minutes into flight, flight was told they were doing construction on runways at JFK. Right before we landed at JFK, they made an announcement to the flight to please let ones who were connecting to Dublin off the flight first as we needed to make our connection. Well, there were about 18-20 of us that missed the flight to Dublin by 8 minutes. Yes, 8 minutes Delta would not hold the flight for us. 10:05pm in JFK and we were told plane left, no flight for 24 hours, I asked if they had a motel for us or any food vouchers - anything, we were told as a group, no. Slept on the floor of JFK Airport tell 8am the next morning then spent $60.00 of my money to check into the Delta Club, yes I got to take a shower and eat and rest, but I feel that of no fault of mine, Delta could have made a little effort to hold the connecting flight for 8 minutes or help all the folks that were in the same position as I was for 24 hours."
"""poor service of a major US airline""","✅ Verified Review | Amsterdam to Boston. Not surprised by poor service of a major US airline. Seats changed at the last minute. Given worst seats in business. Chief flight attendant did not care. Luckily traveling on KLM ticket from South Africa. KLM crew intervened and got our seats changed. Special meals were not on board despite being present on Delta web site. Typical US airline cattle car service despite being in business class. Seats had privacy only one per window once we got our seats changed. Excellent food and comfort once we took off and had issues resolved. Bonus miles for problems on return from customer service were too little too late."
"""seats are very small and narrow""","✅ Verified Review | Dallas Ft. Worth to Atlanta. I have not flown Delta for a very long time. The seats are very small and narrow. I am not a stick thin model but I am also not a 300 lb. person. It might be a good idea to upgrade the planes and add just a little bit more width to the seats. To spend hours sitting in a very narrow seat is pretty bad. Once we landed, I was very sore when I got up."
""" please Delta don't have it so cold""","✅ Verified Review | Amsterdam to Portland. Last year at this time we flew Heathrow to Seattle and Seattle to Portland and it was a wonderful experience especially on the way back because at Portland I was asked to checkin my hand luggage and garment bag. The garment bag didn't make it but after a Delta supervisor made a number of calls the bag was on the next flight and our pilot said on arrival at Heathrow he would let us know if the bag made it. To my amazement after a long flight leaving an hour late but arriving on time he told me at the exit that my bag was indeed on board. What fantastic service. I sent email to Delta but never even got an acknowledgement of it. This year from Amsterdam direct to Portland on DL179 we were called back to the gate because of a security issue. Bags on board but not the passengers who owned them? Not Delta's fault. But on a 10 hour + flight you would expect not to have to be reaching for Jerseys, hoodies & gloves to keep warm. Lots of passengers complained about it being freezing for the whole flight (it was colder than the cold water served up). We are flying back on the 22nd and hope we can get some sleep from Portland to San Francisco to Amsterdam then to Manchester, please Delta don't have it so cold."
"""staff incredibly nice and polite""","✅ Verified Review | Dublin to New York. Best airline I have used. Me and my friend got lost in Dublin airort and missed the flight - two persons from Delta was looking for us everywere but it was too late. Can't find right words to express our disappointment. However, we were ofered another flight to Amsterdam, then to New York. The staff was incredibly nice and polite. We didn't had to pay another flight. On the flight with blankets, free drinks and delicious food. Movies and music. And really very nice and friendly staff."
"""so disappointing""","✅ Verified Review | So disappointing. We've used Delta for international travel many times and had no problems. Internal US domestic travel has been so different. First of all they took our hand luggage off us and told us they had to check them. If we weren't prepared and had a smaller bag each we would of had to scramble and find something to put our essentials in as they didn't care and said there's no room, they need to be checked in. We had a multi leg flight but were told we wouldn't be allowed our luggage for any of the flights even though there might be room on the last flight. The flights themselves were fine, friendly staff and relatively on time. Just minutes late nothing bad. The next night is when we land at Daytona, the last flight and one of our bags doesn't turn up. Luckily an agent was still on site and told us that unfortunately the bag didn't get on the flight at Denver and that instead of being sent to Atlanta they sent it to Minneapolis. The bag is ""hopefully"" going to be on the 11am flight tomorrow which we have to go and pick up ourselves! If not they've told us it's going to be a problem as we are moving resorts everyday as we are on a touring holiday. Sorry Delta but that's not my problem, you ruined our first night in Florida."
"""will not be flying Delta anytime soon""","✅ Verified Review | Pocatello to Charlotte via Portland / Salt Lake City / Atlanta with Delta. I spoke to the customer service agent in Pocatello about a delay notification received. At that point, I wanted to cancel and fly a different airline out of neighboring Salt Lake City. They looked for additional flights, there were no other options were found. Delta agent assured me it would not interfere with original arrival time. I accepted this but after my first flight, my third flight was delayed. I believe it was known originally and they just didn't want to refund my money and have me fly a different airline. Now I am currently stuck in Atlanta waiting on the next flight to Charlotte at noon. This will be my fourth flight. I explained it was my daughters birthday party, which I will not make it to now. I have been at various airports for 24 hrs. I just wanted to cancel and was deterred, lied to and I will not be flying Delta anytime soon. I suggest you choose another airline."
""" I was positively surprised""","✅ Verified Review | Cancun to Orlando. I was positively surprised by Delta's staff good attitude, not common in US carriers. Flight departed on time, seat comfort was acceptable with standard First domestic class pitch. Plane was clean and flight attendants were alert to serve during the short flight between Cancun and Orlando."
"""was not helpful what so ever""","✅ Verified Review | Tampa to Amsterdam via Boston. Worst experience ever. I had a 50 hours delay. Delta was not helpful what so ever. There were hunderds of people at Tampa Airport and only one Delta employee to find flghts. I was forced to stay two extra days in Tampa. They rebooked and cancelled 4 times my flights. I am still waiting for a refund for the premium economy seats I paid for but was not able to use. Also I had to do a lot of talking before they would give me hotel vouchers for the two extra nights. I had to book a hotel myself. Never saw so many frustrated travellers. Delta was not able to handle the situation."
"""disgusted with lack of compassion""","✅ Verified Review | Fort Lauderdale to New York La Guardia. I am very disappointed with this airline, not only did it delay our flight twice by 2 hours each time, I then got tickets to a more resonably timed flight to a different airport in NYC and as soon as I booked the next flight I got a text saying that one was delayed longer than the previous ones. When calling customer service they were very cold and seemed to just be reading off of a script, rather than listening to my frustration. So disgusted with the lack of compassion if I wanted generic conversation and answers I would have called a recorded line"
"""Terrible customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Phoenix to Columbia via Atlanta. My experience with Delta has been horrible all around. I used miles which apparently they treat you like a 2nd class citizen which is insane because that means you fly often. I almost missed my first flight out on my connection due to them being late and having to wait for my carry on. They then made me feel bad about it. When I had booked my flight I had to pick an airport 2 hours from home because they were out of my nonblack out tickets. I tried to get my flight switched which they had flights for and they said yes and then changed their mind and said no. Now I go to check in and my flight is running late and I will most likely miss my connection. When I got frustrated they just told me it isn't their fault and I have no right to be upset. Then I asked it they can do anything and they said no it isn't our problem. I will now get home a day later. Terrible customer service. They should be embarrassed they treat their customers that fly with them often this way."
"""re-gated 4 times""","✅ Verified Review | Flying on Delta today has been one of the worst experiences I've had flying with any airline. My original departure for return started in Brunswick followed by a horrendous stop in Atlanta. Upon arrival at approx 230 pm I was directed to a boarding gate in terminal A gate 17. A short hour later they changed the gate to terminal A gate 31. A short hour later the flight was changed to terminal B gate 33. Keep in mind at no time was an announcement ever made for gate change, the unmanned tv screen just miraculously changed without notice. Just when we thought it was over and by we I mean the several passengers in wheelchairs, and those needing assistance to board, we're notified that 2 mins prior to boarding time they had changed gates again. This time we would have to run essentially to terminal E gate 35. Some arrived approx 10 mins after scheduled boarding including myself to be told that the flight will mow be pushed back because it flew in from Colombia and needed to be cleaned. I approached the gate representative and notified him that my next leg from Seattle was international and that the new arrival time only allows a 30 minute window between arrival time and actual departure of my next leg international to Victoria, Canada. The response I got was priceless and he typed my name into the computer to verify and suddenly looked up with a smile as he said I guess you should run when you get there! While I wanted to laugh I also realized it's probably not a good time as a rep to be making jokes to passengers who have been re-gated 4 times and may or may not make it home to their family on time or even the same day. Professionalism and some punctuality is important if you wish for customers to return and in this case as I heard from the crowd numerous times Delta lost many return customers to include myself."
"""asked us to get off the plane""","✅ Verified Review | Miami to New York JFK. Only after 3 hours of delay, Delta reported a problem with the airplane and started the maintenance and 7-8 hours after the original boarding time we finally board. We waited 2 hours with not even water in a hot aircraft when they announced that the crew was working for too long and they asked us to get off the plane. Only one person from Delta was outside but he didn't know how to explain anything. At the end I left the airport after 12 hours and was not even offered any voucher or transport. I lost one day at the airport. Spent a lot of money with food, transportation, hotel and didn't get paid for the event I was working. Delta offered me $100, which I didn't accept."
"""gracious, kind and efficient""","✅ Verified Review | Honolulu to Los Angeles with Delta. The flight was more then fine but what I am happy to say is the quality with which they handled a 12 hour delay due to a sick pilot which was no ones fault. Every passenger was efficiently issued vouchers for a room at a five star hotel, a round trip taxi and meal vouchers. In addition Medallion members received 10,000 extra miles. Everyone was gracious, kind and efficient. Kudos to Delta Honolulu for their actions."
"""never again, Delta""","✅ Verified Review | Delta flight left Billings, MT late. Connecting flight to Houston would not wait even until departure time for group of about 8 people who made it to the gate by running completely across the airport and managed to make it as much as 8 min prior to departure. Wanted to fly me all night thru two addition airports to get me to my destination midmorning the following day. The best they were willing to do when I refused was put me in a room tonight to get to Houston on a late morning flight. Chose to return to Billings and have to rebook at my expense to try again later this week. Clerk gave me a ticket and said I'd get there at 11 something. Got to that gate and checked status so I could give my husband the right time and found this flight also delayed. Est time of arrival is now 1.20am. I paid for you to waste my day today, but never again, Delta. I wish Southwest would add Billings to their destinations."
"""A job well done""","❎ Unverified | Delayed flight and express baggage transfer Delayed due to weather led to a late departure giving a really tight transfer at Minneapolis for onwards flight to Amsterdam and connecting to Bristol. They had about 35 minutes to make my onward flight and luckily that was not an issue. Did not expect my checked bag to make it and geared up for a late delivery once I got back to the UK. To give all at Minneapolis full credit that checked bag arrived at AMS and finally at Bristol. A job well done."
"""Not even Ryanair is this bad""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Miami. Lost not one but all 4 luggages. No one from Delta has assisted us during this stressful and utterly inconvenient episode. No one at Delta lost baggage department picks up the phone (we waited once over an hour on the line), chat line unable to help , email customer service does not respond, twitter account does not respond. We have no idea where our luggage is and are completely left on our own without information. Not even Ryanair is this bad and that is telling a lot about this airline."
"""canceled without prior notification""","✅ Verified Review | Panama City (Florida) to Baltimore via Atlanta. Only fly Delta if you don't mind your flight being canceled without prior notification until you arrive at the airport and then your connecting flight being delayed because they waiting on a flight attendant. This is my experience."
"""one mistake after the next""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from Denver to Detroit. I've been flying Delta for years but will never again. From the time I initially booked to the 3 hours I've been waiting online because they messed up the tickets for my 2 daughters I am traveling with. It has been one mistake after the next. As I stand in the longest line I have ever seen, I listen to story after story of people that have had similar experiences. What a terrible airline. Never again."
"""Worst travel experience ever""","✅ Verified Review | Worst travel experience ever. I was traveling for business and it was horrible! Delta staff was nowhere to be found and kept postponing but not canceling my flight for 10 hours! Every Delta employee I dealt with was rude and horrible customer service. I ended up driving from Atlanta to Nashville to try and catch a flight and when I arrived in Atlanta on the 6th at 4am the staff that opened up was incredibly rude. They did not help me rearrange my flight and I went to American Airlines who were helpful and got me home. When I asked Delta for help getting my luggage that was still on my cancelled plane in Atlanta they told me to have American Airlines handle it and it was no longer their responsibility. Great customer service in stressful times creates customers for life - Delta did not earn any customers for life that day."
"""doubt I will ever fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Roanoke to Cancun via Atlanta with Delta. Been stuck in Atlanta since 5pm yesterday and to top it off was stuck in Roanoke from 7am till almost 4pm the same day. No fuel for the plane for the 7am flight which made us miss getting to ATL. Put on a flight that finally got cancelled due to no co pilot, then spent 6.5 hours waiting to speak to someone in line at the service desk to get a flight which now at 12:23pm is delayed because once again no flight crew. Delta has cost me 2 days of vacation time at work and I have lost almost 2 days of time at the resort that's paid for on advance and not refundable. No one from Delta cares and keeps blaming the weather, however Delta didn't have fuel for my first plane and have now twice have had no crew for a plane that is ready. They don't even care I slept in a terminal because there were no hotel rooms available. I doubt I will ever fly Delta again because no one seems to care about how they have inconvenienced me and my wife - other airlines made the trip out of here why can't they?"
"""not fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Columbus to Daytona Beach via Atlanta. Delta is the poorest run airline. Delays, cancellations and no updates! App stops working and looses flight data. Try to go to the counter to get assistance and after several interruptions I finally get a ticket to Orlando. Terrible experience overall, may not fly Delta again!"
"""a good airline for your travel needs""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Indianapolis to Salt Lake City via Atlanta. Got the ticket at the airport because Frontier cancelled the original flight unexpectedly. First time flying US domestic with Delta Air Lines. Although the service was not as good as the International service with Delta, it was similar to other US airlines. Complementary drinks and snacks such as pretzels and peanuts are provided throughout the trip. The domestic inflight entertainment system is the same as the international IFE. However, headphones are not complementary unlike international routes which is not a big problem if you bring your own. Overall, Delta is a good airline for your travel needs."
"""Delta what has happened""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from Amsterdam to Detroit. Oh Delta what has happened to your economy comfort plus product. It used to be worth the upgrade. Now I'm not so sure. Inedible food, I defy anyone to guess what we were offered, pic attached. Reduced beverage trolley service. You used to be treated a bit better, not now. Increased cost reduced service. Trip only saved by decent aircraft and inflight back seat entertainment system."
"""no complimentary snacks or drinks""","✅ Verified Review | Due to fly from Orlando to LaGuardia. Terrible. Got to the airport 2 hrs in advance. As soon as I get there the flight has been delayed from 8.15am to 9.15am. I wait an hour and the flight attendant comes out and says ""remember everyone the flight is not departing at 9.15am!"" It's will be departing when the maintainence is done, which will be around 10.30am. We are not departing at 10.30am. Now I'm stuck here with no complimentary snacks or drinks for this over 2 hr wait."
"""the airline was great""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Phoenix. As a first time Delta flyer, I was nervous because of bad reviews I've seen. But in reality, the airline was great. From the gate person to the customer service, all was excellent. The only bad thing was that I got off with sore knees because economy is not very accommodating for anyone above 5 foot 6. So if you're above average height, you may want to save up for First Class for that extra leg room. But otherwise, Delta was great!"
"""luggage handlers were bad""","✅ Verified Review | Grand Forks to Baltimore Washington via Minneapolis. The flight attendants were good, the luggage handlers were bad. I could see them from my 13A seat. They threw people's into the luggage vehicles with no care. My bag which I bought and used just for that trip now looks like it's 15 years old. Not good for such a massive airline. Feeling disappointed."
"""never again fly this airline""","❎ Unverified | Cancun to San Francisco via Los Angeles. I have never been on a more frustrating flight. First, our flight was delayed an hour and a half (from 6pm to 7:30pm). Then, another hour and a half delay (7:30 to 9pm) Then after we finally boarded the plane and they made sure we were buckled in and ready to go, they let us know that another flight with higher priority took our slot at SFO and our flight was cancelled. I called customer service immediately and they let me know, they booked us on a flight at 8am the next morning! Keep in mind we were catching a connecting flight so we would've had to get hotel rooms for a family of 8 due to their mistake. I was then told my only other option was an extremely reduced per ticket refund because I had already flown most of the way. I dont know about others, but I dont like booking flights for ""most of the way there"". I took their refund and my family and I rented a car from LAX to SFO. Customer service over the phone was shoddy to say the least and the people at the gate were completely useless! They were dismissive and rude at the gate. I will never again fly this airline."
"""consistently had poor service""","✅ Verified Review | I just want to make it known for anyone debating airlines that JetBlue and Southwest are far superior arilines. They allow two carry-ons for those who don't want to wait for an added 40 minutes at the carrousel for a small luggage bag. They won't make you check your small bag on a half empty flight like Delta. I've sadly consistently had poor service, lots of attitude, and the rules they have are nonsensical. This will be the fourth time I've flown Delta and it will be the fourth time there's been a problem. Never again."
"""5 star to zero in moments""","✅ Verified Review | Minneapolis to Seattle. From 5 star to zero in moments. That first statement speaks to my recent Delta Air Lines experience. It started with one of the best flights on Delta Air Lines where I flew from cancun to Minneapolis. The captains of the plane struck up conversation before boarding and were very friendly. When we boarded the flight attendants asked our names, where we were from and treated us like gold. But, then we got to Minneapolis. We asked politely if there were any upgrades available and the gate agent answered the most condescending ""you do that when you book. Who told you that you could come here and ask me for this?!"" I was stunned. Not just stunned frankly insulted and angered. Paying customers should never be treated with such contempt and outright disgust. Delta who claims to put there customers first in this instance treated us like mere nuisances. This will definitely impact my decision whether or not to fly Delta in the future. To make matters worse I saw the same gate agent treating other customers with attitude, contempt and disgust."
"""staff attentive and very sweet""","✅ Verified Review | Panama City to Appleton via Atlanta. Flying with a lap child was convenient. The staff was attentive and very sweet on all legs of our trip. It would have been helpful to have in flight entertainment included in the price of the ticket on the MD88 like on the A319 however. The A319 had headrest television with multiple options for children, the MD88 had no entertainment and a fee of 16 dollars to allow use of wifi. It was a short flight, however and our child was entertained with toys and l looking out the window. There was preboarding for us on all flights and no extra fee for her to fly."
"""had the best experience""","❎ Unverified | Orlando to Detroit. I never write reviews, but this time I am. I had the best experience with Delta airlines last Saturday. I was flying with my two young children, who are both afraid to fly like their mother. The seats on Delta were very comfortable, roomy, actually had leg room. Plane also came with your own personal tablet/tv with a great variety of videos and movies to watch. The pilot continuously kept us informed, as occasionally there was some turbulence. The stewards very humorous and friendly. My son said after, ""mom I like flying"". I was very impressed from the time I drop my luggage off all the way to picking it up. Delta was a little more expensive then the other flights, but worth it. Thank you, as you have no idea what anxieties we had after our last flight with a different company."
"""both flights delayed""","✅ Verified Review | Providence to Raleigh/Durham via Detroit and Atlanta. For many years I have flown with Delta Air Lines nationally and internationally. Most of the time I was very pleased and complemented their kindness and great service. However, my last experience was totally the contrary. Both flights were delayed. I missed my connection and 90% of the agents I had to speak with were practically rude and had no desire to help. After going from one customer service station to another, I found a very kind agent who took her time and found me a seat in the next available flight. No apologies, no willingness to solve the problem was the attitude of the other ones."
"""Delta experience was mediocre""","✅ Verified Review | Boston to Guatemala City via Atlanta. This is the first time that I've flown in a number of years. I don't usually fly with Delta when I do fly, but there were several aspects to this trip which were disappointing. My wife and I went on a missions trip to Guatemala. Of the 16 of us, baggage was delayed for 5!! For one person, it was delayed for 2 days (out of a 7 day trip!). The Guatemalan baggage attendant did not provide a file reference number to us (which we needed for baggage charge reimbursement purposes), so I just completed an online letter to them explaining why I cannot complete their online form (wasting more of my time). Additionally, on the trip home, we actually happened to get upgraded to a ""comfort plus"" seat. The desk attendant told us it cost an extra $100 for these seats and we would get a complementary drink if we desired. The leg room was definitely better, but that was it. We were never offered any drink, and the service/attention we received was no different than in economy - which, in my opinion, was also sub-par. With the financial windfall airlines have enjoyed the last few years, I would expect more - and also cannot understand why they charge for 1 checked bag at all! In sum, this Delta experience was mediocre."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","✅ Verified Review | Worst customer service I have received. I had a flight from Houston to New York scheduled for today, Monday the 13th, and have been calling to adjust my flight due to the storm since Friday. I was told numerous times that my flight would not be affected by this storm and that in order to change my flight I would need to pay a change fee and the difference. This is completely unacceptable when you have customers being proactive and willing to take earlier flights. I was more than willing to pay the difference in the flight, but no fee waiver was offered. After 4 calls and no help from any customer support representative my flight has now been canceled with no option but to fly out mid-day Wednesday. I am not only losing business but have important job opportunities at risk."
"""a pleasure to fly with""","✅ Verified Review | Excellent transcon on DL1290 from Atlanta to San Francisco in first class on a refurbished B757. Flight departed on time and arrived about 10 minutes late. Weather was forecast to be turbulent but pilot altered course and altitude to provide a smooth ride. First class flight attendant was first class. Friendly, energetic, and a pleasure to fly with. Service was fast, food was decent, and glasses were refilled. Noticed that wine is now served from a full bottle, which is a nice upgrade. The B757, while an oldie, had a completely new cabin with in-seat power, personal TV screen, and wifi. The wifi didn't work well on all four segments of my trip. Not sure if it is Delta's receivers, traffic load, or the fact that Gogo doesn't support their connection app anymore, but it took over 45 minutes to connect on each flight. (Gogo was great on Virgin America the week before). Fast gate arrival and my baggage was on the carousel at SFO before I made it to the arrivals level. Baggage was priority tagged and handled accordingly, except they ripped off my luggage ID tag. From chocks down to exiting the SFO parking garage was 5 minutes tops. Delta continues to be my first choice for long hauls from SFO, even though a connection is usually required."
"""no one even acknowledged us at all""","✅ Verified Review | I flew this morning from Charlottesville, VA to Boston, MA with a layover in New York at La Guardia. The flight from Charlottesville was delayed by 30 minutes, making me very afraid that I would miss my connecting flight in NY as the turnaround was very quick. Made it to La Guardia and ran to the Gate listed on my boarding pass, only to learn that the Gate had been switched. I was never notified and there was no announcement made. The flight from La Guardia left 35 minutes late. Onboard that flight, I was seated in the one row on the entire plane that was skipped for snacks/drinks. No apologies were made, and no one even acknowledged us at all. It felt as though we were intentionally being ignored. All in all, I feel quite disrespected and don't intend to fly with Delta again. There was one flight attendant on the flight out of Charlottesville who stood out for her excellent customer service and great attitude."
"""perfect from start to finish""","✅ Verified Review | Delta Air Lines from New York JFK to Honolulu. Perfect from start to finish. International lie flat seat, good food, excellent entertainment but mostly a warm and efficient staff. Flights to Hawaii are often on old aircraft with bad food and crabby attendants. This flight was a joy. I hope this seasonal service is extended to year round. Delta really gets this one right."
"""could not ask for better service""","✅ Verified Review | Guatemala City to Montreal via Atlanta on 1st February. The first leg we were in first class. The steward who served us from Guatemala City to Atlanta (DL910) was excellent. One could not ask for better service. We would like to pass this on to him and add it to his file. The rest of the flights were okay."
"""Poor attitude all around""","✅ Verified Review | Jackson Hole to Reno via Salt Lake City. Weather mishap, compounded by lack of sympathy and poor customer service. Initial flight delayed 2 hours. Missed connection by 10 minutes. No attempt to get me off the plane (or the other 10 people on that connection) quicker was made. We possibly could have made that flight if we were allowed to exit first. Second, calling help line I asked when the next flight out was, she said ""tomorrow"" and laughed. They offer no protection for weather delays, I was given a toothbrush kit with bathroom essentials after lying on the terminal carpet for nine hours. I purchased a bottle of whiskey and put it in my carry-on in Jackson after checking with airline security that this was allowed. The next day, they actually tried to charge me to check my carry-on or dump the bottle out. Since I bought my own hotel room and left the terminal, this bottle was no longer considered safe. When I asked them to comp it as an ""I'm sorry how poor your flight was"" the check in lady said, ""it not like it's our fault you bought whiskey"" - after asking her supervisor, they comped the whiskey. Poor attitude all around. Never fly again if I can avoid it."
"""great for short haul flight""","✅ Verified Review | Washington to New York. Delta Air Lines a great for a short haul flight because they gave me what I expect. Although there was no food because it is only short haul I never felt bored. The seat was good and it has enough legroom. The cabin is clean and the flight attendant funny and very accommodating."
"""consider flying with Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Buffalo return. On both flights, check-in and luggage drop-off at the airports were a breeze with hardly any need to queue. Several check-in desks were available. On my return flight, I reached the airport about 1.5 hours to departure and again, there was no need to queue. There were many kiosks available for self check-ins. Baggage drop-off and counter check-ins all took place at the counters. I appreciated the ease of joining a single queue that handled both check-in and baggage drop-off. The customer service person attended to my check-in baggage, tagged it, and brought it straight to the conveyor belt behind the counter, all in one station. This was so much easier compared to another US airline I flew with last year, also out from JFK, where I had to join 3 separate queues at 3 separate stations: one for check-in, then another one to have my luggage weighed and tagged, and a third station to drop off my baggage. The areas surrounding these 3 stations were, needless to say, crowded. chaotic and messy. For the passengers, I cannot imagine it being a superior experience than having one station that handles everything from check-ins to luggage drop-off. Boarding for both flights were orderly and according to frequent flyer status, premium or economy seats and zones. The planes were small and did not have a lot of storage space was available but the airline allows passengers to place their larger hand carry bags at the aero bridge prior to boarding which were then brought by handlers to be loaded in the cargo hold. On the out-going flight, free pretzels, cookies or peanuts were offered to passengers in economy with free drinking water. On the return flight, there were free pretzels or cookies with free water, tea, coffee and I believe soft drinks too. The captains made announcements at the beginning of each flight on the traffic at the airport and the expected take off time. The outgoing flight was on time but the return flight experienced a 20 mins delays. Passengers were able to access entertainment programmes like movies, sticoms, etc, through their own devices by logging into Delta Studio using the wifi onboard. The access to the entertainment programme which had a good selection of American and foreign movies is free. This was my first short haul experience with Delta. I experienced a Europe-US flight with Delta last year on A KLM ticket which was a good one. I would definitely consider flying with Delta again if the ticket price is competitive."
"""needs serious lessons in customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Charlotte. Let me preface by saying this is not against Delta as a whole. It's for the gate agent. The lady working the gate in Atlanta at B29 on 2/23 for the flight to Charlotte at 3:10pm needs some serious lessons in customer service. I understand they have policies and protocols but there's really no need to be blatantly rude to your customers about it. I fly almost weekly with a carry on (that I'm almost always forced to check at the gate), my computer bag and a small purse. The purse can fit inside the computer bag but I wear it as a cross body and just slide it in the computer bag when I get to my seat. As I am walking into the tarmac she makes me stop and consolidate my tiny purse into my laptop bag. After a quick argument saying that it'll fit, I fly with this all the time she forces me to step aside, so I did and then I backed up to be out of the way and she proceeds to yell at me for where I choose to stand and then essentially makes fun of me to the next passenger boarding saying that I clearly didn't understand her the first ten times she said it. For the record, I heard her and I know the rules. I fly enough with the same 3 items and I'm never given a hard time about it. So if she enforces her rules more than others, bravo to a job well done but at least do it with some finesse and class. She's just rude and unprofessional. This is Delta, not a low class airline. The best part was, after I consolidated, they forced me to check my carry on anyways. She could have suggested that from the getgo instead of making a spectacle of me. The 1 out of 10 stars is for her, not Delta."
"""uninterested and unhelpful""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Great Falls via Salt Lake city. Flight delayed resulting in missed connection and adding hours to my travel time after already being in transit for 24 hours. Came off a code share flight from Australia. This is the 3rd change Delta Air Lines have made to my flight since booking last December. The staff here in Los Angeles have been uninterested and unhelpful to the point of rudeness"
"""the planes are run down ""","✅ Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Paris. Last time for me to fly Delta. Yes, they provide a comparatively cheap fare from Germany to the US, but on both legs (to and from US) technical troubles with the plane (to US: engine; from US: autopilot) led to substantial delays. Badly enough, the information policy on the ground was non-existent (""just don't go anywhere and wait until we board"") and on my way back my luggage was lost at Paris CDG airport and arrived three days later. Even though the Business Class product is not bad considering the price, the planes (old Boeing 767/757's) are run down and the two technical issues described above are certainly related to the fact that this airline strives at still flying 20+ year old planes on main routes."
"""doesn't value you as a customer""","✅ Verified Review | Charlestown to Atlanta via New Orleans. I booked a flight on Delta.com 6 months in advance and at the time was not given an assigned seat at that time. As the trip got closer I tried to see if I could get assigned seats so I was sure my wife and I were sitting together. I was told that there was a $50 upgrade fee in order to get assigned seats. I fly 2-5 times a year and I thought this was strange, I had never heard of this before on any airline. The day before our flights I received an email from Delta that they had changed the times of all of our flights. We booked our flights at specific times because we were meeting another couple in New Orleans. because of the flight change they were going to have to sit in the airpot for 2 hours waiting for us. When we arrived to check in they tried to bump us to an even later flight. on our connecting flight they did the same thing. On the return flight our plane arrived early but the gate was damaged and we had to be towed to another gate. This caused us to miss our connecting flight leaving us stranded in the airport for more than 4 hours. We had to scramble to make arrangements while going from gate to gate in the airport only to get home well after 12am. A 14 hour travel day. After almost two hours on the phone with Delta's support they offered us a $100 voucher. That was my last Delta flight. There are plenty of airlines to choose from. Why fly with a company that doesn't value you as a customer?"
"""never been so disappointed""","✅ Verified Review | Raleigh-Durham to New York LaGuardia with Delta. I had a flight set up for the 12th and was forced to rebook to the 13th due to severe weather. My flight was scheduled to depart at 7am. I got confirmation just the night before, and had confirmation via email as well. I set my rides around this schedule, got up at 4am and headed to the airport. While in route, nearly arriving at the airport, my boarding pass changed to a 7pm flight. I received no email, no phone call and no text. I called to have this corrected and the representative lied to me and told me that the 7am flight was cancelled so they moved me to the 7pm flight without any form of update. Upon checking with Delta, I found that the 7am flight was still on time to depart. I state again that I had already nearly arrived at the airport by the time I got the notice of the 12 hour change. I have never been so disappointed in my life, I was able to have it changed to a 12pm flight, however this should not have been the case. Someone made a very big mistake along the way and I paid the price, not only did I pay the price but no one took accountability for this. Needless to say my frequent flyer miles are now wasted as I will never again fly Delta, nor will I recommend Delta to anyone."
"""very disappointed all round""","✅ Verified Review | Nashville to San Francisco via Salt Lake City. Where to start, we got to Nashville airport with 2 check in bags each (3 of us traveling) and thought it would be easier to check in at the road side counter. The guy there weighed all our bags and then said 'come around this side of the counter and see the total cost for your bags', it was a total of $480 USD for the 6 bags. Now mind you we weighed all our bags before getting to the airport, they were on the limit yes, but he tried to say 1 was close to 60 pound. He then said he would make them all go through for the usual $30 per bag if we 'look after him', so we had to pay him cash (he had a massive amount of cash in his pocket) not so sure if this is Deltas policy. Onboard our leg from SLC to San Fran we asked for a beverage in which we were charged for. We were in Comfort + seating which clearly states on their website and in their brochure in the back of the seat that all drinks including alcohol are free. When asking if this is the case we got a little chuckle and 'argh no mam, no they're not included' and he proceeded to charge us. After re reading the brochure I asked the other attendant who looked at me blankly and said 'yes that's right they're included'. I advised him that his colleague doesn't know this and he has been charging all of us for what's supposed to be included. He had to go and refund everyone one by one. Then to top it off we get to San Francisco airport, get our luggage and my sister in laws brand new Jeep suitcase is distroyed. Literally falling apart. Looks like it had been run over. So off we go to luggage counter and the lady there - while chewing on a lollie - looks at us like we're morons and says 'oh I can get you another one but it won't be a Jeep one sorry'. Well that will have to do unless you want us to carry our underwear and toiletries from San Francisco back to Melbourne. Appalling Delta, very disappointed all round!"
"""my holiday was ruined""","✅ Verified Review | Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta / Paris. I was on a 3 day trip to Copenhagen, Denmark to meet my family, my sister came from London and brother came from Sri Lanka to meet me. I bought the ticket with KLM, but the flight was cancelled and they reschedule my ticket with Delta. My bags were checked in at Tucson to Copenhagen via Atlanta and Paris. However, from the beginning, I had bad experiences, at the check in desk two ladies refused to let me board saying that I do not have a valid visa to travel to France even though I produce them my Danish resident permit which is valid for all Schengen states. They simply gave my passport back saying that I cannot travel to France without a valid visa. (I am a Sri Lankan passport holder with a Danish resident permit). I had to speak to their supervisor, and he issued the boarding passes to only to Paris. Enquired him about the boarding pass from Paris to Copenhagen, he said I can get it from the machine once I arrived in Paris. When I arrived in Paris I tried to print my boarding pass, but I was not able to print it due to the fact that they find my flight reservation CDG to CPH. I had to rush to Air France customer service, and they said Delta has not issued my ticket from CDG to CPH while rescheduling my ticket. After 20 minutes thanks to Air France staff they gave my boarding pass. Once I arrived in Copenhagen my baggage did not appear. Then I asked for assistance at CPH lost baggage services to locate my baggage, and they informed me that they have no record after Atlanta. They asked me to contact Delta customer services agents. I contacted them and they were simply reading back to me what is on the Delta website and asked me to wait or either file a lost baggage complain. As per the telephone conversation with Delta baggage services on Saturday, they said they will deliver the baggage to my United States address as they do not have information regarding my baggage. Saturday the 10th December around 10.30pm they rang me and informed me that my baggage arrived at CPH and they are going to deliver it to my hotel. However, I could not hand over those to him as baggage was delivered to me around 11.00pm Danish time Saturday the 10th December, after my brother left Copenhagen. He flew back to Sri Lanka on the 10th December. I was really stressed out as I had to carry the Christmas gifts back to the US and I have no other way to deliver the gifts before Christmas. Moreover, I have to carry that 16kg back to Denmark next time. I asked them for extra compensation as they ruined my holiday as well as I have to find another way of sending the stuff to my family which I already bought for them. I don't think anyone would spend the US $1200 just for 3 days travel if the trip is not really important. Due to their mistake, my holiday was ruined and I could not fulfil the purpose of my travel. I am very disappointed with this Airline and I will avoid flying Delta again.."
"""cabin service impressed me""","✅ Verified Review | Denver to London return via Detroit outbound, and Minneapolis on return. Delta provided punctual flights, comfortable seats, acceptable food, and good cabin service. This review pertains only to the Detroit to London return flights. Delta Comfort seats had excellent legroom (I'm 6'3"") and width (weight 160) and cushioning. We sat in seats 17A/B both routes. In-flight entertainment was OK, but I prefer to watch iPad or do crosswords. Sleep was possible with the recline and own neck pillow, but it was fitful because I dislike sleeping sitting up. Cabin service impressed me. We received two meals, a snack, and at least three beverage rounds (drinks, coffee/tea, juice). Cabin crew were attentive and conscientious. We have flown British Airways and American Airlines internationally on this same route previously and were not impressed. Delta wins. I might add that the Detroit airport was great. We landed about 8:30pm and our flight departed 10pm. Very few people were in the terminal, but most shops were open for water, snacks, etc. It's a modern place."
"""I expected better customer relations""","✅ Verified Review | New Bern to Key West via Atlanta. This flight was supposed to leave at 0550 this am, it was delayed until 0800, then delayed until 1030, now delayed until 1058. We will miss our stand by flight from Atlanta to Key West, and have have to wait until 3.02pm and arrive in Key West at 5pm. Looking at a wasted day of our vacation. We are paying top dollar to stay in Key West and had purchased tickets for a festival today that ends at 5pm ($85). We won't get there to even enjoy a part of the beautiful weather. I have been up since 0130am. No food court, no bottled water offered, just doughnut and coffee. All Delta has offered is $125 voucher for a $377 flight. I find it very hard to understand why there are not any locally based standby pilots in case of sickness, and now no fuel. Very disappointing Delta - I expected better customer relations from you."
"""the seats are tightly spaced""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Delta Air Lines from Los Angeles to Phoenix. Terrible judgement. They had half the plane gate check their bags when there was room in the overhead bins. This cost me 30 minutes on the destination side and caused me to miss my evening plans. Whoever came up with such a short sighted policy or made the decision should be punished. On top of this the seats are tightly spaced my knees heavily abutt the seat in front of me. This airline is very poorly run in my opinion."
"""I will never fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Las Vegas to Seattle. Delta has the worst customer experience team. They cancelled my flight and refuse to provide a refund or alternate ticket, instead they are so generous to waive all the fees and only require me to pay the increased fare price. How generous! This is what I got after waiting on hold for hours, having my call dropped twice, and being transferred to the wrong department twice. Clearly these guys just wanted to get rid of me - and they were successful. I will never fly Delta again."
"""uncommunicative and unprofessional""","✅ Verified Review | Philadelphia to Denver via Atlanta. Never again with Delta. No communication, we were diverted to Tennessee for weather reasons (understandable), then de-boarded and re-boarded - only to have mechanical errors. I have been waiting on the Delta staff to tell me what's going on for hours and their customer service line has a 2 hour wait. This is ridiculous. I will never fly them again. Uncommunicative and unprofessional. No voucher offers for food or water ($4/ small bottle at the airport)."
"""I recommend Delta Airlines""","✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Portland, Oregon with Delta Air Lines. First, my ticket said terminal 4, even though the departing terminal was terminal 2. Check-in was fine. Boarding Counter people were excellent. Plane was very clean, IFE was responsive. Flight Attendants were kind and helpful, and I especially love their new uniforms. Seat was nice, declined to 160 degrees, and was very cushioned. Steak and mashed potatoes with garlicky greens were better than delicious. For dessert, I had Italian ice in a plastic cup. All in all, very comfortable, very good flight. I recommend Delta Airlines."
"""certainly fly with Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Over Christmas time I had flown 5 sectors on Delta. La Guardia to Winnipeg via Minneapolis, returning to San Francisco via Minneapolis, and then San Francisco to New York JFK. 4 out of 5 flights were on time, with even earlier arrival, one flight as delayed by 40 min, but we were advised by the delay. Excellent service at check-in, gate and on board. Cabin crew were attentive and drinks and snacks were served several time during flights. Good entertainment system onboard the longer flights from MSP to SFO and from SFO to JFK. Bags were delivered on the baggage belt in good amount of time. Will certainly fly with Delta again and recommend that other will do that as well."
"""never fly this airline again""","✅ Verified Review | Hayden to Washington Reagan via Minneapolis. I paid full price for a ticket, and was held back until only one seat on the plane was left. Passengers paying with points and even stand-by passengers were allowed to board before me. When I asked why I was being singled out, the gate staff mumbled something about not understanding the ""algorithms"" the airline uses and walked back to her post. Once I was given a boarding pass, I asked the ground crew if it was still OK to bring my carry-on with me, and they said ""yes."" When I finally boarded, however, the attendant said there was no overhead room left for my carry-on and that I needed to walk back to the gate and check it. I've never been treated so badly by an airline, for no apparent reason. Their policy seems to be to overbook and let the passengers and gate-keepers sort it out. They want to guarantee a full plane at a few passengers' expense. The passenger doesn't come first for this airline, only their profits. I will never fly this airline again."
"""have not changed their stripes""","✅ Verified Review | Bonaire to Salt Lake City via Atlanta. There were a number of issues on this flight - some beyond the control of the airline. But Delta failed to cater an international flight of over 5 hours duration. There were no first class meals at all and not enough coach meals to go around. Passengers were asked to share which was OK because the sandwich they provided to me was soggy - almost soaking wet and smelled so bad I refused to eat it in any event. Beverages were also in short supply and at the end of the flight as a first class passenger I was offered a choice of Diet Coke or tomato juice only. According to staff the plane should have been catered for the return flight in Atlanta and that did not get done. Flight crew advised that they had asked the terminal staff in Bonaire to make an announcement that if you wanted food or drink you needed to buy it before boarding. If that was done neither myself or anyone I talked to in first class heard the announcement. Flight crew promised that Delta would have a representative at the gate in Atlanta to do something for our inconvenience - that was a pipe dream. Due to the delays I had to run to clear customs, immigration and make my next flight out of Atlanta - also in the first class cabin but with no meal service. So I had a 12 hour travel day with a soggy, inedible sandwich and two bags of chips. I am a frequent business traveler and I avoid Delta whenever I can because they always lose bags, have issues with departure times etc etc. My first Delta flight since 2011 shows they have not changed their stripes."
"""terrible customer support""","✅ Verified Review | Absolutely terrible customer support and laughably-expensive air fares. I ended up cancelling my flight from NM to Iceland and was offered an e-credit (for much less than what the flight was worth), which was fine. However, upon trying to redeem said e-credit I was given a very thorough run-around. Two days of multiple phone calls and numerous lengthy hold times and I was even disconnected instead of transferred, which led to another hold. Finally, I was assisted with redeeming my e-credit but only to find out that it didn't even come close to covering the cost of flying NM to CA (this was a credit from NM to Iceland!), and furthermore, the flight times and number of transfers was atrocious (8 hours of travel time, to go 3 states away - 8 hours). In conclusion I will never be using this airline again."
"""no information was forthcoming""","✅ Verified Review | Never will we fly with Delta Air Lines again. We travelled from Heathrow to Atlanta on 28/12/2016 and our flight was delayed by two hours which meant that we missed our connecting flight to the Dominican Republic. We were reassured at Heathrow that rebooking would be taken care of. There was no further information at any point other than vague and empty reassurances after which we had to wait in a queue for immigration control for one and half hours. By this time I had a migraine and felt very unwell from the stress of the entire situation. After another queue at re-booking queue of 30 minutes were we told that there were no further flights for the day and we were booked into the Holiday Inn South Hotel, and provided with food vouchers for an evening meal and breakfast. We lost a day of our holiday as a result. On our return journey 10/01/17, our flight was delayed again and we were not sure if we had missed the connecting flight to London Heathrow as again we were not given any information. We were very anxious about missing the flight again, and we left our camera on the aircraft. We were in a queue for immigration for two hours - no information was forthcoming despite repeated requests for information as it was likely we could be re-booked for the 09.37 flight later that evening. We were told by one of the border agents that if we did not like waiting that we should not visit the United States. We then arrived at re-booking and had to wait a further 30 minutes to be told that we had been booked on the next flight which was leaving in 5 minutes and that we should run to the boarding gates. We pushed our way through the security ran all the way to the shuttle train, down corridors and up escalators and got to the gate to be told the flight had gone and there was nothing they could do. We were given a voucher to stay at the Ramada Plaza hotel. We did not have any hand luggage as this was checked on the flight but we were told we could collect an overnight pack. The queue for this appeared a further 30 minute wait so we headed off to the hotel. We arrived at the hotel to queue for a further 30 minutes before being allocated a room for the night. We were told that food vouchers could not be provided as this should have been given by the staff at the airport. We order some food which arrived at 1.00 am in the morning which we paid for using our visa card. As a result of the delays my husband has had to take a day's leave due to the delays."
"""overall a very smooth flight""","✅ Verified Review | Dallas Ft Worth to Madrid via Atlanta. The flight from DFW to ATL boarded on time, the staff was very friendly with everyone. We got drink and snacks. Once we arrived at Atlanta I had to transfer to the international gates. The flight was pretty full the staff on this flight was outstanding, they started serving the drinks quickly then came out the food right after that. Overall a very smooth flight and they staff were very on point with keeping the drinks flowing to everyone."
"""not expect to be left high and dry""","✅ Verified Review | I am currently in Day 4 of a 13 day trip to Ukraine. My bags were checked on Sunday in PHL to JFK then to AMS (KLM) and to KBP (KLM - Ukraine International Airlines) but have still not appeared in Ukraine. I am getting no reasonable assistance from Delta Air Lines to assist me in locating my bags and making sure they get to me in Ukraine. The level 1 and 2 agents in Customer Service and baggage are refusing to own this situation, and pretty much just reading back to me what is on the Delta website. I am now resorting to Social media so hopefully someone outside of the @Delta customer service organization sees this and will reach out to me to assist. I am so dissapointed with the customer experience on this issue. I am a loyal Platinum member who takes brand loyalty very seriously and do not expect to be left high and dry this way."
"""this is a terrible airline""","✅ Verified Review | Memphis to Atlanta. This is a terrible airline if I am being completely honest. I have been rebooked 3 times, I have waited in the airport for over 9 hours for my flight to be rebooked due to weather. Because of weather they do not put you up in a hotel, so I have paid for my own hotel for 2 nights now. No other airline has delays or cancellations in the country either, other airlines are going to the same places that I am and are still going."
"""lack of ability to rebook a flight""","✅ Verified Review | Fayetteville to Stuttgart via Atlanta. I have used Delta Air Lines on countless occasion, flying over 100,000 miles on military orders easy. This may be the last time. Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to make me care enough to write a review. The service from the flight attendants is typically very attentive and they do what they can to accommodate you. The entertainment has a wide selection of movies, music etc. (when the screens are actually operational) and the seats are not unbearable. My issue is with the airlines lack of accommodation when they have a failure to notify the individual that their flight was cancelled and lack of ability to rebook a flight that is equivalent to the one that was paid for. By missing my flight and not being able to reach the deadlines that are required makes me look unprofessional and weighs heavy on my position. This flight definitely put a bad taste in my mouth in regards to Delta Air Lines, unfortunately there was not any attempt to reconcile the issue."
"""attendants not the most courteous I have seen""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from Amsterdam to Boston. Most Delta aircraft are aged but nicely refitted. The IFE is nice but movie selection and variety I have experienced better. In the aircraft's we have flown there were no power sockets. Attendants not the most courteous I have seen. Overall the price was excellent and seats were comfortable so the airline is worth it as partnering with Skyteam offers excellent flight combinations with partners airlines to and from USA."
"""outshines their SkyTeam partners""","✅ Verified Review | Stuttgart to Atlanta. Delta Air Lines messaged early morning about a flight delay which was appreciated. Flight had been oversold and when checking in online I was offered the opportunity to volunteer. Flight was completely full including a large bulldog used as a ""comfort dog."" Cabin crew was somewhat senior but gracious, in the aisles to assist passengers as they boarded. Service began quickly and the welcoming attitudes continued with flight attendants engaging with passengers as services were offered. While there is nothing specific to tag as having made the flight good, it just was. Everything - food, entertainment, staff availability, even the seat - was comfortable. Delta economy class service outshines their SkyTeam partners and this flight was a perfect example."
"""there were so many empty seats""","✅ Verified Review | My wife and I flew Delta Air Lines from HNL to NRT. We booked on Expedia and a day before the flight we got an email reminder showing our seats, etc. We had booked our seats so we were sitting together. Unfortunately, when we got to the airport, we found ourselves sitting in middle seats in different rows. I explained that my wife was pregnant with morning sickness and it would be great if they could at least switch her to a seat in the aisle. But both the girl at check-in and the guy at the gate said they had no seats for us to change to and that we couldn't upgrade. ""Fine,"" I thought, ""sucks for us, but if they have a full plane then there's nothing they can do about it."" The really upsetting thing is that after boarding we saw that there were many seats open just a few rows in front and behind us. Luckily there was a couple sitting next to us that had been similarly split up and we ended up switching with them so we could both sit with our spouses. I don't know what the deal with Delta seat selection is, but given that they couldn't even accommodate my pregnant wife when there were so many empty seats made this our last Delta flight ever. P.S. I found crumbs on my tray table from the previous flight. Also, the touch screen for my entertainment was broken (It responded to about 1 out of every 10 times I touched it)."
"""maintenance standards and competencies""","✅ Verified Review | Milwaukee to Calgary via Minneapolis. Three of the four flights were inordinately delayed, not because of weather which I would have understood given the season, but because of mechanical problems. The departure time from Milwaukee was constantly pushed back -- to an extent that we missed the connecting flight at Minneapolis. I was assured when the first delay was announced that we would make the connection with the new timing. This happened a second time. We were willing to cancel our tickets and take flights on alternative airlines. But the gate agents were not able to be honest about the actual departure time -- in fact, they said they were only the messengers of the news. In the event, we lost the entire day travelling and reached our destination so late that we had to arrange for alternative transportation because we had missed our previously booked non-refundable transfers -- not to mention the holiday activities we had planned that afternoon and evening. It started our holiday on a very bad note. On the return, early morning flight was delayed for mechanical reasons. However we reached Minneapolis in time to connect. But the connecting flight after travelling down the runaway, gathering speed, suddenly braked and returned to the gate - mechanical problems. An alternative plane was arranged and we reached home several hours later. The ground manager asked us to rate them high for having arranged a replacement plane -- what gall! When you have 3 out of 4 flights on the same type of aircraft of the same airline experience mechanical problems, we have to be very concerned about the maintenance standards and competencies at Delta Airlines. Unfortunately, on many routes we have to put up with this airline as there are no alternatives."
"""Even Chinese airlines are better""","✅ Verified Review | Seoul Incheon to San Francisco via Seattle. I used to be a Medallion member. But, moved to the west coast and due to lack of direct flights to some cities from OAK, I have not flew Delta in recent years. I flew from ICN to SFO today after two flights with Asian airlines. What a difference. Delta's seat were so hard, I thought I was setting on the granite. Cold, old and hard! Food was awful. Service, I can't understand why people pay their money to fly Delta. They were serving food and drinks as we were in a soup kitchen. Throwing everything on the table and ""we are out of everything"". Was really bad. Even Chinese airlines are better than Delta."
"""made the start of 2017""","✅ Verified Review | I wanted to take the time to recognize the Delta Staff that helped in making the start of my vacation an absolute dream! As a Stage 4 Breast Cancer patient they literally made the start of 2017, a start I will not forget! On January 2nd my friends and I were set to board a Delta flight from Chicago to Paris where we had a layover before getting to Dublin. I made Delta aware two months prior that I needed an accommodation made to have a seat in Bulk as I had just finished chemo in September and my oncologist wanted me up moving and stretching throughout the flight. Unfortunately, upon arriving to check in, I noticed that this hadn't been done, but explained my situation to them and they kindly placed me in an appropriate seat. Prior to boarding my name was called and they had decided to move me into business class. In addition when they found out I was flying with friends they moved their seats up to premium economy, so that I would be able to easily be able to walk up and down the aisles and talk with them. Throughout the flight the staff checked on me and my friends as well. Delta Airlines has a Breast Cancer Research Foundation and this is the first time that I've actually seen a company represent the Pink Ribbon so well! The staff didn't have to care about my situation or consider my friends in the mix, but they did and the fact that they made this flight what it was to me, means absolutely everything!"
"""late departure was Delta's fault""","✅ Verified Review | Minneapolis to Guangzhou via Detroit and Beijing, returning from Beijing via Detroit. Departing flight was fine, Delta spend a few more bucks for better food, refreshments, and bottled water was generously given out. This made a 13 hour flight more pleasant. The downside was the arrival at Guangzhou on a China Southern Airlines domestic flight, had to depart plane only to get herded into a stand up bus, then to door to get luggage. It was hot, and after a 26 hour flight time makes one grumpy. Return was fair, food was fair. Real downside was a delayed departure from Beijing to Detroit and then boarding the plane in Detroit to Minneapolis to be treated rudely by attendant for being late after I practically ran from getting my luggage to go through customs then to the boarding gate. The late departure was Delta's fault, faulty equipment. Several times I have witnessed passengers treated this way going to Minneapolis on the night flight."
"""huge line of about 45 minutes""","✅ Verified Review | Baltimore to San Diego via Salt Lake City. The worst part of my trip was Delta. Only 2 staff working at the check in counter. There was a huge line of about 45 minutes. We were afraid of missing our plane. The machines they had for the check in procedure were not working. When my turn arrived, I asked for help. The guy told me to go to a different desk to get assistance. When I got there the lady told me I had to wait in another line or if not I could call a number. I dialed the number but they had me 10 minutes waiting. This is not the first time I had problems with them. I do not want to fly with them anymore. Enough is enough."
"""terrible for first class""","✅ Verified Review | Seats were terrible for first class. It is ridiculous that Delta has sardine canned in people in first class, this is coach, not first. We are in seat 1C/D, and there is no legroom whatsoever, I just walked back to coach, and the first seats in coach have more leg room than our seats. Our seats recline the same as coach or less, maybe 2 inches at that. This is not worth the money, better to sit in emergency row exit in Coach. We had to wait for about 20 people who said they needed ""more time"" to board the plane before they called first class, and most of the people who lined up to get on the plane first looked absolutely fine to us. This is so ridiculous. For the money we paid they should allow us at least to get on the plane first ."
"""a very good flight""","✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Salt Lake City. A very good flight with the attendants being very attentive. Food was as per airline food. Seats were a bit tired but for economy, but reasonable room. The screen for movies etc was not very responsive. Having said that, it was way better than American Airlines whom we flew to Salt Lake last year via Chicago."
"""lacked respect and customer service""","✅ Verified Review | DL1598, Dec 25 I was traveling for the holidays with my husband from Seattle to Atlanta and we were in row 14 seats A&B. I started to not feel well from a cold and I had asked the steward if I may please have a tissue or napkin. He promptly replied that there were tissues in the bathroom. I said, Sir I know but I don't want to have to wake the women sleeping next to me and I really didn't feel well enough to get up and walk around at the moment. He repeated his statement about the tissues in the bathroom and walked away. This was the general attitude if we requested other things such as headphones we offered to buy for $2 (which they said was the price) but they never came back. My family has worked for Delta for 20 years and I have always favored this airline but as a paying customer traveling with my family this year this was a flight that certainly lacked respect and customer service which was incredibly disappointing."
"""completely uncomfortable""","✅ Verified Review | I booked my flight home for the holidays from Los Angeles to Pittsburgh via New York JFK in March 2016 with my girlfriend. I specifically avoided exit and back rows because it's a 6+hour flight and I want to recline my seat. Delta changed my flight 5 times and changed our seats. I was fine with the seat change because we were next to each other until I show up and realize it's on the back row. Completely uncomfortable. I will avoid flying Delta again."
"""nightmare travel experience""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Portland. I have never experienced such a nightmare travel experience. Of the 4 flights we took, including connecting flights, every single plane was delayed or changed last minute - not even related to weather. I spent more hours in airports and on phones and in lines with Delta customer service over this 10 day vacation than I ever care to again. And the compensation for the first leg of the flight was minimal and wasn't even offered until after several hours on the phone and we had to make the request. Delta was the only airline with lines longer than space available for lines on both legs of the trip, so clearly it's a consistent and internal issue. Unapologetic customer service, late to connecting flights, missing entire days of a vacation stuck in airports. Not where I'd like to spend my money ever again."
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Worst experience to date with an airline. Sat on the tarmack because of a scheduling issue. An hour after landing, we are still sitting here because another flight is at our gate. After 2 connecting flights the last thing I want to do is sit here and listen to the captain come up with excuses. I will never fly Delta again."
"""will not fly this airline again""","✅ Verified Review | We booked our trip from Dallas to New York La Guardia in the spring. We received confirmation immediately. We received a notice for change of flight in October, with the same confirmation number. 2 days before our December 17th flight, received instructions to choose our seats. When my husband attempted to choose our seats and check in, he was told that my seat was on standby. I immediately began to panic. He called the airline to correct the obvious mistake, only to be told that we needed to upgrade to premium seats that cost an added $60. We had no other choice since our original seats had been given away. As we were about to board, the attendant said that our seats were not premium. We ended up in economy as originally assigned, plus we were out an additional $60. We were economy on the way home also. This experience was stressful. I cried, not knowing multiple times if we were going to actually have a seat that had been guaranteed months before! I will not fly this airline again since they were unapologetic and offered nothing to compensate our stress or the extra money that we paid to guarantee a seat."
"""a very frustrating experience""","✅ Verified Review | Dane County to Louisville via Detroit. I volunteered to take a later flight because they overbooked my original flight. The gate agents offered a $400 travel voucher to people willing to fly on a later flight. I volunteered and the gate agent told me he booked me on a later flight that day. My original flight ends up being about 1.5 hours delayed and at the end of boarding for the earlier flight the gate agents called my name up to the counter. At this point, the earlier flight is taxiing away from the gate and when I get up to the counter the gate agents have no idea why I'm up there. They had literally just called me to the counter and then didn't know why I was up there. Of course this concerned me so I wanted to verify my flight details for later that day. The gate agents had no idea what I was talking about. They had not booked me on that later flight. I had them book me at that point and verified with them I would still get the travel voucher. The gate agents assured me I wold still get the voucher. Of course, a couple weeks go by and nothing shows up in my Delta account so I submit a request. I finally get a call almost 2 months later from someone at Delta headquarters. She let's me know that, ""there were empty seats on the earlier flight and there was no way the gate agents would have offered me a voucher. Since I didn't get booked on the later flight until after the earlier flight, there was no way my story was true."" This entire experience was ridiculous and I will never volunteer to change flights ever again and any chance I can use United instead of Delta, I will. Everyone I talked to was nice, but almost patronizing, like there was no way my story was true. This was a very frustrating experience that has been time consuming."
"""the worst customer service""","✅ Verified Review | I was taking what was to be a simple flight from Phildelphia to Chicago with a quick stopover in Detroit. When I landed in Detroit (before 8am), I saw that the flight had been delayed by an hour. This was not a bad thing, given that my original flight would have been boarding by the time I landed and I needed to get from an A gate to a B gate. That flight landed, deplaned, some crew arrived and got on board, and we are waiting, and waiting. They told us we were waiting for a First Officer, they had no idea where he was but hadn't shown up. So while we waited, the crew for our flight timed out. So, they send us a few gates down, where we waited for a flight that was coming in from Minneapolis. This was delayed, then delayed some more, then mechanical issues, then for two hours they told us the plane had pulled away from the gate, but hadn't taken off yet. From what I can tell, the plane never did, and I am not convinced there even was a plane coming. So, at around 3 something, they move us yet again from a B gate, back over to an A gate. Here, the gate agent told me there was a 5:40 flight, but that this flight was scheduled to take off at 5:25, so I should stick with that. All things were looking good (9 hours later) to get this 5:25 flight out. Plane lands on time, plane deboards, some crew get on board, and we are all eagerly anticipating geting on and getting home. Then they start delaying us in 10 minute incriments. Now, while it seemed like some sort of sick joke, the announcement comes across that once again they cannot find a pilot or the first officer. So we waited, and waited, and waited. The horrible realization was creeping up that time was of the essence and I likely was not going to get home that day for no good reason. There was one final flight out that night at 8:30. I went to customer service, where she was anything of customer friendly, but I finally got one of the last two seats available on that flight. She told me I had been switched to the 5:40 flight and missed it, which I had never been told happened and had been given a boarding pass and seat assignment for the flight I was standing waiting on. She accusingly said, ""Well here you go Stephanie, if that's even your name"" as she handed me my boarding pass for the 8:30 flight. Not the slightest bit of an apology as I had been stuck there at this point for 11 hours at nobodys fault but Delta. My time is more valuable then a box of snacks and sack of food from Wendys that were tried to buy me off or passify me. I eat organic, gluten free foods, so that wasn't helping my missed work or hunger. Of course no vouchers were offered, as Delta doesn't offer that, nor was any comfort provided in the Sky Club as I was told that was a different branch. All in all we took off a bit after 9pm after being stuck in Detroit for 13 hours. Some may try to say this was a case of winter weather. That is a lie. This was poor planning, negligence, poor service, and a cheap airline that has no consideration for it's customers well being. I travel 60% of the time for work and for the most part am the decision maker on my travel. For the last year and a half I have purposely stopped flying Delta because of too many flight delays, cancellations, and the worst customer service."
"""whole thing is pretty bad""","✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Amsterdam. At the check-in, I was not assigned a seat and I was not given a boarding pass for my second flight with the same airline! I was told that that the seat will be assigned at the gate. Now I'm at the gate and I was told to wait twenty minutes to be assigned a seat and maybe the second boarding pass can be printed then. This is ridiculous! Also the ground personnel is passive aggressive. Guys, this whole thing is pretty bad."
"""excellent experience with Delta""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Boise via Salt Lake City. I had an excellent experience with Delta. Easy boarding, staff were helpful, the plane was newly renovated and had one of the best in-flight entertainment systems I had used recently. I really enjoyed my trip, and the Delta staff went above and beyond as far as I was concerned."
"""does not care about passengers""","Orlando to Amsterdam. Our flight was delayed and rescheduled three times before we were able to leave Orlando airport. Due to the delayed flight we missed our connecting flight in New York and the earliest they could get us on next flight was 24 hours later. We now had to shell out more money for a hotel and taxi ride (unless we wanted to spend a full 24 hours in a boarding seat with 2 small children). Upon arrival we learned they did not even update our luggage for the revised booking and I had to keep following up to ensure they made the updates. I could go on and on about the worst flight experience of my life but in summary, Delta does not care about their passengers. I've been flying domestically and internationally with many carriers in my lifetime and have had my share of ups and downs, but Delta wins the award for the worst in my book."
"""First Class flight attendant was surly""","✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Ft Lauderdale via Atlanta. We have never flown Delta before, but decided to try them because they are an Alaska Airlines partner. Check in at SFO went well. The First Class cabin flight attendant was surly and not what I've experienced on other airlines in First Class. She was rude and unhelpful. Also on a flight over two hours they're supposed to serve you a meal - they never served us a meal. On our return flight I read that in First you have two free checked bags and the third bag is $25. I'm still looking on their site as they were trying to charge me $150. The website is poorly done and very confusing. I went to Delta checked bags under Delta Airlines and I'm still trying to find it. The customer service was rude and unhelpful when I asked for a supervisor to come and assist. When I explained that his website was not very good at telling me what the baggage fee was he walked away. We were on a full fare First Class ticket and I have never encountered more rude people than I did on these two flights. We will fly United to Florida on our next trip and it would take a lot for us to ever consider using Delta again."
"""lack of professionalism""","✅ Verified Review | Monroe, LA to Orlando, FL via Atlanta, GA. Although my flight was booked 3 months in advance with a 1 hour layover in Atlanta, Delta changed the itinerary to leave me with a 4 hour layover and a significantly delayed arrival at my final destination. On the return trip home, I was on time, but their plane was not. By the time I arrived (once again in Atlanta) there were only seven minutes to catch a connecting flight. I sprinted through the airport to arrive 3 minutes short. The answer from the sarcastic Delta representative - they may be able to place me on standby for a flight leaving in a few hours, but I should probably start checking out hotels. Nice! I am disappointed with their poor logistical planning and lack of professionalism. To top matters off, my suitcase was damaged. If you want to arrive at your location when expected, try another airline! Just because I'm flying into Orlando, that doesn't mean I want a Mickey Mouse operation getting me there."
"""horrible and completely unacceptable""","My Delta flight was supposed to leave Las Vegas at 9:57 a.m. on 20 Nov with connection in Atlanta and arrive in Raleigh at 7:07 p.m.. Flight was delayed 3 hours, then delayed again for another 3 hours due to mechanical problems. Connection in Atlanta was missed and no other flights were available to Raleigh until 22 Nov. Only solution offered by Delta was flight leaving Las Vegas at 3:45 p.m. and arriving in Greensboro at 12:45 a.m. on 21 Nov instead of flying into Raleigh. There was an earlier flight leaving Las Vegas and arriving in Greensboro but it was full. One passenger offered to give up his seat if Delta would pay for hotel accommodations that night but Delta would not pay for the hotel. My car was at the Raleigh Airport. Had to make arrangements for someone to pick me up in Greensboro at 12:45 a.m. on a Sunday night and drive 1.5 hours to Raleigh airport where my car was. Then still had to drive home in Raleigh and get up to leave for work by 6:30 a.m. No other options were offered to me by Delta. This return trip was horrible and completely unacceptable. And I upgraded my seat on the return flight for a window seat so that I could sleep but didn't get that either. I contacted customer service to try to get a refund but all they will offer is a $100 voucher toward another flight that has to be used within one year. I paid extra for my ticket, $984.00 to be exact, so that I could get back into Raleigh at a decent time and all Delta wants to give me is a $100 voucher that I will not be able to use. I tried several times to call Delta Corporate office but just get a message saying that they are unable to take my call at this time, please try again later."
"""annoying and incredibly frustrating""","Due to fly Delta Air Lines from Minneapolis to Tampa. Repeated delays due to a mechanical issue with the incoming flight which will deliver our flight attendants. No plan B, sitting here hours later, with hours to wait remaining. No attendants on call? Ridiculous, unacceptable, annoying and incredibly frustrating."
"""On-board service was friendly and efficient""","✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Atlanta in First Class on a B737-900ER. Delta provides its domestic First Class passengers with premium lane privileges at security but not the use of its lounge. The aircraft was quite new and the cabin was in good condition. Seats had enough width but limited incline, as is the norm on most US domestic carriers. Each seat was fitted with an interactive monitor that was responsive and state-of-the-art. On-board service was friendly and efficient, and the food served better than average. The in-flight wifi service through gogo was $33 for the duration of the flight, which is ridiculous, but I still bought it. The lavatory was unusually small and given that this pane was just 2.6 years old, I wonder why they had to make it this uncomfortable. On the whole, a comfortable flight."
"""staff were courteous, professional, patient""","✅ Verified Review | Was due to fly from Asheville to St Louis via Atlanta. Kudos to ground staff of Delta Flight 5226 for working hard to get passengers revised flights after a delay. Staff were courteous, professional, patient, and went above and beyond to assist passengers. Thanks for the extra snacks and smiles. Delta folks in Asheville NC are top- notch."
"""price was competitive""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to San Jose return on Delta Air Lines. Both sectors were operated by refitted neat and clean Boeing 757-200. Check in fast and friendly. LAX Delta Club not bad. However, DL provides no lounge for business pax in SJO. Both flights on time. Fantastic professional and friendly crew on board. They could not do enough for pax. IFE was excellent. The only criticism was the food. However, have had worse. Baggage was out fast in LAX and SJO. Price paid was competitive and worth every bit."
"""I am impressed""","✅ Verified Review | Cedar Rapids to Grand Forks via Minneapolis. This is just a little kudos to the two Delta employees working in Minneapolis, gate A2. They created such an atmosphere of teamwork and positive attitude that I saw it spill put amongst the passengers. Real laughter, helping people, and I am impressed. Keep it up!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","✅ Verified Review | I planed a trip to Las Vegas and started searching for flights, most important for me was the flight time. It was my first time flying Delta and I and the rest of my family were positively surprised. Beginning from the ground service to the cabin I was impressed, the only thing I could say is that they could do with slightly better seats in economy class. Another thing I would like to point out is the ground service - lost and found items and damaged luggage. Unfortunately it happened to me that we lost important documents and my luggage was damaged. Delta contacted me right after we landed informing us that they found our documents and money. In terms of my damaged luggage, I made a claim, Delta responded in minutes, with a very professional service, returning the whole cost."
"""satisfied with hospitality""","✅ Verified Review | Washington DC to Houston via Atlanta. Delayed start at Washington DC due to technical snag. but Delta let the passengers out of aircraft into terminal and provided refreshments. Due to about 90 mins delayed departure, my connecting flight to Houston missed, but was pleasantly surprised upon landing they were prepared to lodge us overnight and give the next day connecting flight with an apology. Liked the overnight stay in Atlanta in Holiday Inn, following day was promptly picked up from hotel to airport. Overall satisfied with Delta hospitality and sensitivity."
"""professional and efficient""","✅ Verified Review | Zurich to New York JFK. The travel went without a problem from the check-in to getting our luggage. I appreciate the level of consistency in the service. All personnel were professional and efficient. Airplane was clean and comfortable. Food and beverages were better than average and more than sufficient. The flight attendants were attentive and the pilots kept us informed. This is the standard I expect from Delta and I am rarely disappointed."
"""terrible person at the gate","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Charleston. Most of the trip was just fine other than one terrible person at the gate. She was rude and downright inappropriate towards me and my family. I have never been treated so poorly by a supervisor! This woman needs extensive customer service training and because of her alone I am unlikely to fly Delta again. Other than that woman, the food, seats and basically everything provided by Delta was poor, but that is to be expected in economy class. The rest of the ground and flight crew were mostly cordial. My flight did land on time, and I have no other complaints"
"""I will avoid this airline""","✅ Verified Review | I flew from Sioux Falls to Minneapolis with connection to Newark. There was 1 hour delay at FSD due to air traffic according to the pilot and I arrived at MSP too late for my connection. Delta rescheduled me for next day flight but my trip was already ruined due to the delay. Delta stated in MSP that the delay was due to weather which was not true so that they do not have to refund me. Another Delta passenger had the same experience as me who was from a different city. They made me pay for the hotel overnight. I also cancelled the whole trip but they could not tell me even approximate of how much credit I received for cacelling rest of the trip. Delta basically lied about why there was a delay and cannot provide even basic customer service. I will avoid this airline."
"""first class meal, cold processed sandwich""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Kona with Delta. This was a good flight with one bizarre and inappropriate exception. First, the positive. Great friendly efficient staff on the ground and inflight. The overhead bins are the largest i've ever seen and for the first time ever in Hawaii the priority tagged luggage arrived first and in record time. In addition, the Kona ground staff were at luggage claim offering bottled water. Here's the bizarre twist. The first class meal offered was a cold processed sandwich with 3 slices of apple and a Saran wrapped cookie. The wonderful cabin crew was embarrassed and had no idea or explanation. I have flown this flight at least 20 times in the last few years and a hot meal was always offered. This is a 5 hour flight with a 5pm departure in a first class cabin. In addition for a while now Delta has been the only carrier offering wi-Fi between the mainland and Hawaii. Although the aircraft was equipped the service was not available. Again, the flight attendants were as mystified as myself. I thought the new aircraft was an upgrade from the 757?"
"""caring in the old school way""","✅ Verified Review | Honolulu to Los Angeles with Delta in the Premium cabin. Of the old legacy carriers only Delta provides real service. On this internationally configured aircraft I was lucky to have private comfortable space and a lie flat seat. The meal was fine, the entertainment very good and the staff on the ground and in the air were amazing. Friendly, efficient and caring in the old school way. Miles ahead of UA and AA on the same and any route."
"""can't get me to my destination ""","✅ Verified Review | Reno to Cancun via Salt Lake City. Totally floored how I simply can't get Delta to get me to my destination 2 days in a row. Supposed to had arrived yesterday but they closed the door on us yesterday. Today, after being delayed and missing two rescheduled connecting flight, we are still on the tarmac 3 hours later. Looks like we will never get to Cancun where we are to have medical treatment for my wife. When a 9 hour flight takes three days and totally takes you down, you wonder whether Delta has any business being in the air at all. I would give Delta Airlines a 0 but that is not an option."
"""professional and personable""","✅ Verified Review | Our family of four flew from Toronto to Philadelphia via Detroit in Nov 2016, and back again on the same segments. I believe it is the first time we've flown Delta, and we were impressed despite a few hiccups: In general the staff were professional and personable, there seemed to be a real priority on leaving/arriving on time, ground services were able to move passengers onto the plane in good time despite the challenges. Appreciated the free onboard movies and being able to download the gogo app real-time to play the movie, did not use Wi-Fi for Internet access. We got a super deal for this fare. Toronto to Detroit a smaller plane - we were all seated apart from each other, which was not optimal but we knew check-in seat assignment was a condition of the fare we purchased (just didn't realize it could be at the gate) - apparently our names were called at the gate but we did not hear the announcement, and by the time we got to the desk, these were the best seats we could get - one of my children is 10 years old, so I think the system should aim to seat a parent with a child that age or younger - seat assignments at the gate are a bit frustrating, you're in 1 line with a mix of customer issues which take a little to a lot of time to resolve - I stood in line for about 15 minutes only to be told that I would have to wait until my name was called - I was seated in a window seat, in row of two seats. When an obese passenger sat down beside me, I felt very squished (the passenger took ~ 1.5 seats) and I knew (being somewhat claustrophobic) that flying for an hour would not be a tolerable situation - I requested and was granted a seat change to a spare seat so that issue was resolved. However, I think Delta should have given this passenger two seats, it was unfair for both of us, and I'm not sure how the issue would have been resolved had there not been a spare empty seat. - flight was smooth and on time - we were very impressed Detroit to Philly - larger plane, we were able to check-in online and get these seat assignments then, we were all seated together, flight was on time - the landing was a bit hard. Return from Philly to Detroit we were unable to check-in online for some reason, and the error message said we should speak with a Special Services agent at the airport for check-in. It was strange, unlike the online check-in process Toronto-Philly, where I was able to check all four of us in, this time the system separated the two adults, and each child into a separate party - ie. we received three email notifications to check-in separately (which didn't work and we could not check-in online) - we had to speak with a Special Services agent, who was able to seat two of us together (adjacent aisle seats) and the other two in separate areas of the plane. Flight was smooth and on time, they were overbooked (probably due to the previous flight issue) but this issue was resolved. Detroit to Toronto there wasn't enough room to accommodate everyone at the gate area (I believe a previous flight had been cancelled) -the gate was small, seemed more like a hallway. The agent in Philly was able to seat 3 of us, we had to get 1 seat assigned at the gate - flight was delayed because there was a problem closing the cargo door - other than that the flight was smooth, great landing."
"""Delta a very good surprise""","I fly the Europe-Chicago route once to twice a year. I often fly AF-KLM and Delta was a very good surprise! I flew Delta on 23 October and my seat was 29F. Check in was fast since I was connecting in Amsterdam from a flight from Brussels. The aircraft was a 767 in a 2-3-2 layout. The pitch was average in the 31-32 inches and seats ok for economy. What came as a very good surprise was the meal and beverage service. We had a choice of 3 different dinners (one being vegetarian) and they came with an entrée, salad, cheese and dessert. We had a mid-flight snack in a small box and a pre-arrival sandwich. We also had ice cream. Beverages were served often and each was given a bottle of water. Coffee was good and wine and beer was complimentary. I beleive this was of my best economy class flights ever, better than Air France for sure. On the outbound flight, I had seat 10c on the Detroit-Amsterdam in an A330. Great legroom and worth the money. The ticket cost me €460 return and that inlcudes Comfort class from DTW to Amsterdam @ €89 one way. You can't find cheaper for Bru-Amst-MSP-Chicago-DTW-Ams-Brussels, and luggage was on time and no complain with my 15 kilo carry on either. Great experience and very kind staff."
"""I can't thank you enough""","✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Atlanta. Thank you Delta for your patience and understanding during our flight today. My son had a panic attack regarding flying and the flight attendants went out of their way to try to calm him for the remaining of the flight. They offered food, drinks, and headphones to calm him. They continued to check on us and was very patient. I can't thank you enough."
"""inflight staff were awesome""","✅ Verified Review | I have been so impressed with Delta on our flight from Rome to Detroit, the inflight staff were awesome. They remembered the drinks we typically order, they actually smiled at us. The food was pretty decent as far as flight meals go. And on our long flights they kept us well hydrated and well fed. Finally, when we needed to ask questions at the ticket counter, the staff was very kind and helpful. I did not feel like I was putting them out when I had questions. Thanks very much Delta. We will definitely fly with you again!"
"""all due to overbooking""","✅ Verified Review | Calgary to Sacramento via Salt Lake. We never actually made it to our destination. I'm actually sitting in Seattle Airport (not on our original itinerary, but I will explain) waiting for our flight back to Calgary. So, our first flight was from Calgary to Salt Lake City. Get called up to the front desk, turns out they overbooked the flight and I was the lucky overbooked passenger. So, my boyfriend and I agreed to get on a different flight to Seattle, which would get us to Sacramento an hour later than we intended (which isn't too bad). We land in Seattle and they change gates in a different terminal right before the flight. We rush over, plane is delayed an hour. Get on the plane, they inform us of an engine leak. Fix that, say we are on our way. About 40 minutes later, we all get back off the plane. To end this quickly, we are still in Seattle but now waiting for our flight to Calgary. As university students, going on short trips is something you save for. I lost not only a planned weekend (hotels etc) but an entire day at an airport we were never supposed to be at. All due to overbooking. However, I will say that all staff was sympathic and as helpful as they could be. Today was awful and so was this experience. I've heard a few horror stories of Delta, but have now experienced one."
"""flight attendant absolutely super""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Tucson with Delta. Awesome! We missed our 11:55am flight. Delta rebooked 3 of us on the 5pm flight with 1 more in our party on that flight provisionally. The other 2 in our party booked on the 8:30pm flight, with the option of asking for standby on the 5pm flight. We all got on the 5 pm flight, sitting in the last 2 rows, perfect for traveling with 2 kids, Not only that, but the flight attendant was absolutely super - got wings for the 3 year old and got him a visit to the cockpit when we landed. Kudos Delta."
"""cheerful cabin staff""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Grand Cayman Island. I had flown 16 hours and had gone more than 2 days without sleep before getting on this last leg. Onboard I requested the flight attendant for warm water and she asked if I were alright and when I told her what I was going through she gave me a glass of ginger ale which worked instantly. What I love about Delta is just how cheerful their cabin staff were, going out of their way to make passengers happy."
"""cabin crew was the highlight of the experience""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from Los Angeles to Atlanta. I get to the Delta terminal at LA after a somewhat 11-hour flight, the self-check-in was easy and the staff were helpful, I dropped the baggage, the lady serving the counter was really helpful and the baggage drop itself was efficient. I went through TSA and into the terminal. The Delta terminal at LA would be an insult to 3rd world airports because there is absolutely nothing going on there. Unlike the competing American carrier's terminal where there is always music playing and all duty-free on one side, and all planes on the other so passengers can watch planes come and go, it kind of already made me hate the airline. The boarding was pretty efficient, and the cabin crew was the highlight of the experience. This was a red eye flight, and despite that the FA's kept making rounds of the cabin offering water, drinks, and snacks. In addition to that, they went out of their way to shuffle baggage in the cabin to make space without having to check them in. The flight on the plus side arrived 45 minutes early and I couldn't have been happier. The seat was really uncomfortable, and IFE was decent, but you have to press really hard to get it to respond. Other than that, I will fly Delta again in the future."
"""horrible customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Melbourne Fl to Rochester NY via Atlanta. I came back from my cruise way early, like 9.30am and my wife and I were waiting for a 5.50pm flight. The attendant suggested we get on a standby list for an earlier flight so we did. Well we flew out early at 11.24am! Then we got to Atlanta and all went to hell. Delta offered us 1 seat (split us up) on the next early flight not 2 (1 for each of us) so we asked if there was any other way and they said nope, nothing we can do. I asked about our checked bags and was told they would stay here until we depart at 9.20pm, 8.5 hours after landing. At 5pm I got an alert that my luggage was at my final destination while I was still in Atlanta. So after going round and round with this screw up on Delta's end, I'm about to get on the 9.20pm flight with no luggage and not even an apology from them. When I asked about an upgrade they said they can't do that. Horrible customer service, I'm flying Southwest from now on."
"""No complaints whatsoever""","I purchased first class tickets for a Delta Air Lines flight from New York JFK to Rapid City with a layover in Minneapolis . Then I get email that they changed equipment to an all economy flight from Minneapolis to Rapid city. Now for the first flight on October 4 at 11:40 am, the A319 was wonderful, the staff was available offering drinks. The meal that I had ordered was grilled chicken with a barley salad that included dried cranberries and walnuts, excellent meal. My husband had the sliders with fruit salad and potato salad, and said that it too was excellent. The movies were abundant and a wide variety. No complaints whatsoever. Now for the flight out of Minneapolis on the CRJ, the overhead couldn't hold a carry on bag with wheels. Unbelievably tiny, the seats were in good condition, but I was so unconfortable. They should retire these planes or make the overhead bins larger because my carry on fits in every overhead. When we arrived in Rapid city, our bag was the first to come out. I'll let you know if the return flight is as good. Just make sure for a CRJ flight, your carry on is small otherwise, check it in, that's why I gave this a 9 out of 10."
"""excellent customer service""","San Francisco to Atlanta. I flew in for the birth of my grandson and after his birth there were complications and I had purchased a non changeable, non refundable ticket , but I called the airline to change the ticket and I was surprised when the supervisor said she could help. She managed to get my flight date and the city changed. She was very helpful and very pleasant. Delta personnel were very helpful and understanding. Thank you for excellent customer service."
"""quick thinking staff""","✅ Verified Review | Fort Lauderdale to Cincinatti with Delta. We were coming home after a cruise and our original flights were FLL to ATL to CVG. We were able to come to the airport earlier than we thought and went to check in at 12:05 for a 3pm flight. However, the lady at the counter said if we want to we could go in a direct flight to CVG that leaves at 12:30pm. We said sure and she printed new tickets for all 5 of us direct to CVG from FLL. We barely made it to the gate after going through TSA etc. We arrived in CVG before 3pm (even earlier than we were supposed to leave from FLL). So, I want to commend the quick thinking of the staff who was at the check-in counter at FLL. Also, during the flight to CVG we were given fruits and drinks, not once but twice. Much better service than even west to east coast flight on any domestic airline (economy)."
"""best thing was the service""","Indianapolis to Rome return via Atlanta and Detroit. We flew first on the domestic segments and Delta One on the transatlantic segments. The flights were on time, the planes were clean with new interiors. The best thing about this trip was the service provided by all the flight attendants. It couldn't have been better. The attendants were all simply outstanding."
"""horrible service at every turn""","Jacksonville to Seattle via Atlanta with Delta. I flew during the worldwide system failure. It was a horrible day. Because of this failure I missed work, so I missed a paycheck and I eventually bought an Alaska Airlines ticket to ensure I would make it home. I get that mistakes happen but in Atlanta where my biggest delay was we were repeatedly mislead by the staff. 20 min delays turned into 2 hour delays but every 30 mins someone would tell us it was almost boarding time. At least be honest about the situation. Then when the crowd would get understandably frustrated one fellow reminded us all that is was a ""long day for them"" and ""they were all tired too"" - excuse me? You are getting paid right now to do you job. I am losing money by the minute while you are just a half hour away from your house. Just horrible customer service. I got 2 vouchers for $200 each was great. Fortunately these vouchers will allow me to attend my friend's wedding in Jamaica. However, I come to find out after weeks of planning that I can't apply both vouchers for one trip. That's a huge let down as suddenly a ticket I thought would cost me $200 will now cost me $400. I call customer service thinking this will all get cleared up. Wrong. They inform me that they can only apply both vouchers if they honor a new ticket fee of $800 - so what good is the extra $200 off if you then raise the prices? I tried to explain to the rep that this didn't make sense and she informed me their was nothing she could do, told that's just the way it is. Horrible service at every turn. Do everything you can to avoid."
"""avoiding Delta like a plague""","✅ Verified Review | Charlotte, NC to Spokane, WA via Minneapolis. I rarely fly Delta. Out of the four times I've flown Delta two of those have resulted in ""maintenance issues"" resulting in delays over two hours. Currently as I write this review I am sitting on my plane because of a ""maintenance issue."" We have been sitting here over an hour in the plane and even the pilot says no one has told him the status yet. The last time I flew Delta before today my early flight from Las Vegas to Spokane, WA was delayed twelve hours because of another ""maintenance issue."" Needless to say, I'm avoiding Delta like a plague now."
"""stopped getting responses""","✅ Verified Review | Charleston SC to Chicago IL. Maintenance issue we were told was fixed wasn't fixed. Had us board the plane anyway. Sat without updates for an hour then ended up unboarding the plane. We were told there was a flight shortly after out, but then updated that if we checked a bag they couldn't get out bags on soon enough to take it. Tried calling customer service and was ""helped"" by a rude woman. Took to tweeting and stopped getting responses. Called Amex to see if they could help and were really nice but they got put on a 30 min hold with Delta. Stood at the help desk at the airport the whole time and finally got helped and moved to the next flight out. Going to miss a funeral due to the delays and inefficiencies."
"""food and wine was very poor""","✅ Verified Review | Paris CDG to Minneapolis with Delta. Ok flight that was not full so ended up with free seats beside me. The exterior of the aircraft was seriously tatty - paint peeling and patches. Looked like something from a back street used car lot. The inside had the newer seat but the pitch and width is very poor. The seats are well equipped but some of the power outlets were not working. Overall not as good as the competition. The cabin crew was well intentioned but the uniforms were a bit like the outside of the plane. Food and wine was very poor especially as this came from France. Not an airline I would go out of my way to choose."
"""would fly Delta again""","After having a terrible experience with Alitalia going to Italy, it was so nice to get the service you pay for with Delta. We flew Venice to New York JFK. Left on time and arrived 40 minutes early which was nice because customs is a nightmare in NY. The service was wonderful. They constantly fed us and passed around with beverages. The A/C was just right. Alitalia it was so cold I felt like a piece of meat in a freezer. There seemed to be more room on the Boeing than the Airbus. Flight was good but the entertainment system was not working that well on our flight. But anyway that is the least of your worries when you are flying for 8 hours. It's all about being taken care of and flight attendants not having a nasty attitude. I would fly Delta again."
"""business class seat extremely comfortable""","Six segments with Delta Air Lines (one KLM codeshare in Europe), five were on time or early and the last was unavoidably delayed due to fog. Overall a good experience. I found the A330 business class seat to be extremely comfortable. Great for reading, screen time and for napping. AVOD was satisfying, movies included some classics, some new releases and a nice selection of non-US films with subtitles. Good mellow-music channel too. The ground and inflight staff were competent, efficient and a pleasure to deal with, which is my usual experience with Delta personnel. I am not a foodie, but I was not impressed with the catering. Perhaps too high expectations, given all the hype about celebrity chefs and the fancy menu. The first courses (starters, soups, salads) were great, the entrees were barely OK. Likewise the desserts. Wines were good. KLM from AMS to MAD first class is economy three-across seating with nobody seated in the middle, and it probably has some extra leg room. Food was good though."
"""pay for being able to sit together""","Pensacola to Atlanta via Pittsburgh. I fly frequently and usually Delta. My husband and I now have to pay for being able to sit together. We now pay for bags, aisle seats, more leg room. This is ridiculous. We reserve and pay for our seats in advance but now at each connection we have to be assigned seats - makes no sense and I bet most folks don't even realize they are paying for this so called service. Shame on you Delta."
"""my worst experience flying""","✅ Verified Review | Awful flight! Our first plane had a fuel pump failure, we were stuck 3.5h on tarmac going from Atlanta to Munich. Eventually we were let out, and headed to the next plane. On the next plane we had to wait for 1:45min because it needed to be refueled, and the refueling people forgot to close the cap on the gas tank - so that took time to be resolved. I must say the crew did an excellent job dealing with all the issues. But I am very disappointed with Delta Air Lines. ATL is a major Delta hub, so how they don't have an extra plane in case of an emergency?! Also the fact that we were kept 3.5 hours on termac was awful! It is inhuman to keep people on the plane while trying to fix it. The fumes that eventually leaked from flooded engine were suffocating us, all while we were told to hang on tight and wait until they figure out if the pump works. I know I do not spend time in my car while mechanic is working on it, so why the passengers had to stay on the plane while having mechanical issues. By far this was my worst experience flying, and I travel a lot. Overall I am greatly disappointed with how Delta handles its business when planes are facing mechanical issues. I don't blame the crew - I blame Delta."
"""very unimpressed""","✅ Verified Review | Minneapolis to Phoenix with Delta. I checked in with the seat I had chosen online, however, when going past the ticketing agent to board the plane, she handed me a new seat assignment. This was a middle seat 12 rows back from my chosen seat. If somebody had needed my seat to be close to family would have been happy to switch, however was very unimpressed that they had not bothered to ask or tell me ahead of time. Luckily I was traveling alone this flight. Will definitely consider other airlines in the future."
"""I will fly Delta again""","It was a bit of a hipcup at Heathrow as we were travelling to New York via Amsterdam and only after we checked in our luggage and were in the departure lounge we were notified that we were transfered to a direct flight. Wrong information was given to us as when we arrive to transfer point to have our new boarding passes that the flight was closed. The staff in the transfer were helpful and staff at the gate was brilliant, although I gave them hell (sorry) they were very helpul and corteous. We were notified prior taking off that the luggage will not be on board. Flight service was excellent. They were very apologetic all the way through and dome their best to none to put things right. Despite the initial impression I will fly Delta again. Comfortable seats and spacious. Great inflight entertaintment."
"""my back paid the price""","Flew Delta from Detroit to Munich. Overall a good flight, the 767 has seen better days and its age shows with the AVOD system being very slow. Selection of movies was good and kept me reasonable entertained. The flight departed on time and arrived early, staff were friendly throughout the flight and came around often with drinks. The food served tasted good, the small snack that served as breakfast was ok but since they ran out of water they couldn't serve any coffee. Seat lacked padding and at the end of the flight my back paid the price."
"""cabin crew worked hard""","Purchasing ticket with Delta worked out cheaper then booking with Virgin. Flight with Virgin to and from Atlanta was very good. Delta flies MD90 from Atlanta to Daytona Beach, as a pilot in a previous life I found that very nostalgic and had to take a few pictures of this old bird. Ground staff at Atlanta all friendly and helpful. Last minute change of gate handled well and all passengers cheerful. Cabin crew worked hard on this 1hr flight. Landed on time. Will fly with them again."
"""very impressed with Delta""","✅ Verified Review | Indianapolis to Philadelphia via Atlanta with Delta for business and here are my observations. Aircraft retrofitted and new and clean. Crew were friendly and gave good eye contact. Ground crew were also so kind and went out of their way to help us. All flights were on time - I was very impressed with Delta."
"""flight crew were friendly""","✅ Verified Review | Early flight from San Diego to Detroit was full. Flight departed a few minutes late but arrived early into DTW. Flight crew were friendly and came around frequently to sell food and beverages, although in this instance I didn't purchase anything. Plane was clean and the AVOD system was new with a wide range of movies. The seat offered plenty room even for economy. Only thing I can't understand, is that why after boarding the premium and loyalty passengers, they choose to go from front to back."
"""was impressed by the staff""","✅ Verified Review | Cancun to Salt Lake City. I was impressed by the staff on this flight. I had one passenger behind me having a serious panic attack. The flight attendants did everything to comfort her and help her in any way possible. The passenger sitting in front of her ( next to me) spoke rudely and disrepectfully about the poor lady having the panick attack only adding to the situation. The flight attendants asked politely for the women in front to move her seat forward in exchange for complimentary drinks the rest of the flight. To help the women feel more comfortable having the panic attack. The lady flat refused loudly and rudely. During all of this. As if they didnt have their hands full they had 3 different people who repetitively pressed the assistance button to demand alcholic beverages. One group pressed the button non stop for 5 minutes until they where helped. The flight attendant apologized and made them aware of the situation. So I applaud the flight attendants on this flight. I would never wish a group of customers like that on anyone."
"""flying with them was painless""","✅ Verified Review | Munich to San Diego via Detroit. After reading all the reviews I had set the bar very low. As it turns out flying with them was painless. Seats were comfortable, although the domestic leg offered more leg room and a newer entertainment system than international. The staff although older than most carriers I've flown were friendly and professional. Selection of shows to watch was extensive with a very wide range to please most tastes. The only real down sides is that the touch screens on the 767 old and didn't respond that well. The other being the cold cabin on the international legs. The food offered was quite good. As far as the punctuality goes all flights left on time and arrived early."
"""plenty of movies to watch""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Hong Kong with Delta. A very nice flight. Ground staff helped me to check in as the self-service kiosk couldn't cope with me taking a one-way flight, so got checked in super quick. Adequate and reasonable food. Plenty of alcohol. The FA just said started pouring the wine and said, 'You tell me when to stop'. Frequent offers of water throughout the flight. Plenty of movies to watch on the IFE. Good earphones. Polite FA's on the whole. Amenities kit provided. Flight left on time. No complaints at all."
"""interior is completely refurbished""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from Vancouver to Washington DC via Minneapolis. I'm in shock. Although the A320 on this three hour flight is 18 years old the interior is completely refurbished, including panels and overhead bins. The seats are new and very comfy. Every seat has a power outlet. Even the lavatories are completely refurbished. Then came the meal. Glass glasses. Nicely patterned table cloth. Bamboo looking non-slip trays. Copious amounts of delicious food presented in an elegant way. Great red wine. Wonderful service. Add to that the great onboard free streamed entertainment system titled Online Delta Studio, which you can access on any of your devices, and an internet connection that actually works. I'm so impressed with Delta right now for this is an airline I despised, and rightfully so, for having some of the worse onboard experiences. But if they can maintain this experience and keep it consistent throughout all their flights, I'm ready to convert. An actual 5-star experience on one of the US legacy airlines. Never thought I’d witness the day."
"""basically had to pay twice for tickets""","✅ Verified Review | We were to fly out of Omaha to Los Cabos via Atlanta with Delta. We got to airport at 3:30 a.m. only to find out our flight said it was delayed until 10:00 a.m. Called 1-800 number right away, was on hold for 25 minutes. We asked if they could rebook us on another flight that morning. After looking things over our flight was actually showing decommissioned and no other flights scheduled to replace. They tried to see if any other flights available and then asked if anyone was at the Delta counter and told me to talk to them. I hung up and went to Delta counter and basically they couldn't explain to me why this happened but stated they could see if there were any other fights available. They kept asking me if there were still 4 of us flying, I said yes this is our family vacation so all 4 of us were going to Mexico. There were no flights available but they could possibly get 3 of us out that day and the other person out the next day. I told her that would not work, so the only other other option was to leave the next day. I politely said I knew this wasn't their fault but wanted to know why Delta would cancel the flight without making other accommodations for the passengers whose flight schedules were now messed up. I was handed a Delta card with the 1-800 number and told me to call them. I indicated I already did. This was a huge ordeal as I felt Delta was of no help for something they created. Long story short, in order to fly out that day I had to purchase additional tickets with American Airlines. I went back to the Delta counter spoke and said I was able to get tickets with American and wanted to cancel the ones just booked. She said that was fine but that would also cancel our return flight. I indicated that was unfair as the flight going to was the only one affected, but was told this wasn't how it worked. I had to call the 800 # with my travel agent and tell the story again to find out if I purchased the tickets with American if I could keep my return tickets with Delta. She said yes I should since this was Delta's fault, she told me to go to the Delta counter and let them know. I told her they were not helpful and basically told me no. She placed me on hold came back and stated she got a hold of Delta and all was confirmed, return flight was still valid and cancelled only tickets going out. My travel agent is trying to get those tickets refunded from Delta since I basically had to pay twice for tickets to Mexico. Ridiculous - shame on Delta."
"""provided excellent care""","✅ Verified Review | Raleigh–Durham to Brussels via New York JFK with Delta. I had an great experience, particularly on the JFK to Brussels flight. The cabin staff, and especially the staff who served my meals, provided excellent care and was very attentive. It made my whole flight very enjoyable. I will definitely fly Delta again."
"""can't provide the service paid for""","Atlanta to Key West with Delta. Customer service is horrible and Delta made no attempt to even consider helping. They offer ""help"" via chat and the hold time to speak to anyone in reservations is ""more than 2 hours"". Is it 2 hours, 5 hours? I'll never know. It feels deliberate that they make it so difficult to let customers share any complaints. 11 hour flight delay for foul weather conditions that don't exist and they don't even offer a hotel voucher when they can't provide the service that was paid for. I come from the service industry and I know what it entails and what good service is. I will never give another penny to this awful company."
"""were able to get us on the next flight""","Las Vegas to Orlanda via Atlanta - we were supposed to be on Delta flight 1450. I want to commend some of Delta's excellent employees. We were notified on our way to LAS via Delta phone app that our flight had been cancelled. We were pretty distraught, as we had been re-booked for a 6 am flight and were hoping to fly out that night and not have to stay in Vegas. I called the number for Delta and talked to a helpful agent who was able to get us on stand-by for the 1:00am flight, since our previous, 12:45am flight had been cancelled. When we got to baggage check-in, the staff made sure that we could get on the flight without being on standby. The flight left late however, so we did not make our connecting flight in Atlanta. They were able to get us on the next flight and we were still in Orlando about the same time we would've been had we made the cancelled flight."
"""not a good flight""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Incheon with Delta. I paid to upgrade to economy plus. I had seat 19B (an aisle seat). I am a good size guy and fit in my seat with room to spare, but the guy who Delta sat in 19A was twice as wide as me and took up half my seat. The plane was overbooked, so no changing seats. The seat divider could not come down because his leg was in the way. It was an 11 hour flight having to cuddle with a guy in the seat next to me. My suggestion is if passengers look big have a trial seat to have them sit in. If the don't fit make them buys 2 tickets. This was not a good flight."
"""the staff was not only polite""","✅ Verified Review | Chicago to Atlanta. Had a problem with my upgrade not showing on ticket. When I arrived at the counter to pre-check my bag, the staff was not only polite he had a smile on his face the entire time. That's a simple thing that is too often forgotten. But can make my choice of doing business with Delta a continuous success."
"""stop overbooking your flights""","Flew from Anchorage to San Francisco via Seattle. I am becoming increasingly disappointed with Delta Air Lines, and the travel process in general. 1) Customers should be asked for their height and weight/whether they will physically observe more than one seat, upon purchasing a ticket. As an American female of average or under average height/weight, each time I am seated next to a large person it frustrates me that I am increasingly limited into an already insufficient space. I try my best to be tolerant but it frustrates me that I am paying the same amount of money to have someone's body mass spill over and occupy a portion of my seat. It's uncomfortable for me and embarrassing for them. Either make them buy two regular seats or one first class seat. 2) I understand the temperature of the plane has a purpose, but when I am still too cold/uncomfortable when wearing two sweatshirts, a jacket, jeans and a blanket, you need to turn the heat up a little. 3) Stop overbooking your flights. People aren't paying to get bumped out of their seats. 4) My flight today was delayed 4 hours and I am missing one of the events that I specifically purchased this ticket for. I was also told there was no way to get on an earlier flight. This is ridiculous. In all my years of flying, I have never had such an issue on any other airline. Your CEO states that Delta strives for ""unparalleled quality"" (or something to that effect). My experience has been far from it."
"""Flight was good""","Albuquerque to Seattle via Salt Lake City. Good flights, Boarding passes printed improperly so the TSA pre-check scanner could not scan them causing us to go through the normal line, which would be fine, except we tried to do pre-check in the first place. Time waste was 20 min due to TSA's confusion. Flight was good, Salt Lake was packed with people and incredibly uncomfortable. was a breeze, except for the traffic."
"""Awful customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Awful customer service at check in. First time flying with my infant (in lap) son, with my mom, and was told we were seated together. Wasn't until actual check in we found out we weren't and when asked to change it, was told there was nothing they could do for us. Had to call Delta three times to finally receive email confirmation of ticket purchase. Also, ""valet checked"" my sons stroller and upon arriving in Atlanta, the sun visor was missing. Tried to talk to gate agent in ATL but was told to do that in Fort Smith (my final destination). Upon arriving there, I was told I should have filed in Atlanta so they can't help me, but here's a phone number. I called it and filed a claim, only to be told Fort Smith should have done that for me and I was simply brushed off. It's been almost 3 weeks since I filed the claim and still have not heard from Delta to replace the part on my stroller."
"""extremely disappointed and frustrated""","Our original flight got delayed so Delta put us on a flight the next day which included a 7 hour layover in Houston. The agents at IAD included a hotel room for the layover but the gate agents in Houston refused to give us the hotel room. They even refused to give us meal vouchers, which was extremely unprofessional and repugnant. Delta, the worst policy for a business is to make promises you can't keep and in this situation, you did just that. Extremely disappointed and frustrated."
"""struggling to return home""","✅ Verified Review | The new interior cabin updates seem to ""look"" nice, however, it is clear that whoever designed this has never worked on an aircraft. The lavatories walls are so narrow it would be very difficult for anyone over 190 lbs to manoeuvre freely. Not only are the lavatories almost half the size, the space has cut into the galley so that now you feel terrible standing in the way of flight attendants with no where to stand that is not inhibiting either other passengers or the attendants. The staff were warm and friendly, but they too confessed these updates were difficult for them becuase they can no longer even see when passengers request assistance or have questions from their seats. The call lights are too low on the overhead space for attendants to see and there has been zero adjustment on leg space and comfort for passengers. In addition there was no inflight entertainment on a 5 hour flight. After this terrible experience, I have now been struggling to return home to Los Angeles from my work trip to Louisville, due to Delta's system crashing, their apparent logical response to the thousands of passengers stranded is to prolong and cancel even more flights putting the issue off. At some point all these people are going to have to fly home, cancelling more flights due to overcrowded scheduling is actually making the problem worse. While I have time to afford not going back to work immediately (since I haven't been able to get home yet and this is now the third flight I've finally been able to snag a seat) there were dozens of military at ticketing with no flight options out so that they could arrive and report for duty and training. I feel for the ticketing staff, attendants and all else who work for Delta who are not responsible for this mess, as they are the ones reaping the overworked hours and disgruntled travelers."
"""Delta wasted my time""","✅ Verified Review | Was due to fly from Buffalo to Minneapolis. My flight was cancelled one hour before the departure time, I then sat on hold for another hour before their phone system hung up on me. I would never recomend flying Delta to anyone, but since they are a large company it seems there is no other option. I dont understand why the customer service is so bad for such a large company. Delta wasted my time."
"""never use their services again""","✅ Verified Review | Salt Lake City to San Francisco. Everyone at this airport hates Delta Air Lines right now. The couple next to me had their flight delayed for one whole day, all the hotels are overbooked, and they are forced to sleep in the airport. I understand there was a outage at Delta but they should have prepared for things like this. Everyone who has had their flight canceled or delayed should be given a full refund. At the very least, bring out some water and blankets for these families and children who had to camp out at the airport. People are missing weddings, important events, and sleep. I have work tomorrow and my flight has been delayed 5 times. My plane won't leave until 3am. A lot of people have it worse. I hear people shunning Delta and swearing to never use their services again."
"""worst airline I have ever flown""","Detroit to Phoenix This was the worst airline I have ever flown. Flew out of Allentown, and it took 35 minutes just to get through check in because the staff did not know what they were doing. Flight was slightly delayed and arrived in Detroit. Connecting flight from Detroit to Phoenix was delayed an hour and thirty minutes. Arrived in Arizona 2.5 hours past when I was supposed to land. They did not put my bag on my flight even though they had the hour and thirty minute delay to transfer it. Extremely unhappy with this airline. Never again."
"""clueless as to what to do""","✅ Verified Review | Boston to Daytona Beach via Atlanta. My son and I along with hundreds of other passengers were left stranded on a tarmac with the captain and crew absolutely clueless as to what to do. There was no place to park the plane they said. I pointed out several open terminals out the window and even suggested a manual exit like you see done every day. Instead, Delta left us on the plane like cattle for hours. Shame on you delta."
"""disorganized and careless service ""","✅ Verified Review | Los Angeles to Minneapolis. I am actually mad at myself that I have Delta another chance. This airline have frustrated me profoundly 2 times in the past. However, today I having the experience that will keep me from flying with this company ever again. Now is 8:30am during my summer in Los Angeles, no weather issues whatsoever and I have been waiting for my flight since 11:30pm yesterday and still don't know when I am going to be able to get in a plane. Probably at night. Incredibly rude, disorganized and careless service because their system were down the entire night. This is not a one time thing. Delta is a horrible company and you should avoid it."
"""delayed, bumped, stranded""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Rome with Delta. Delayed, bumped, stranded for over 24 hours. I spent over 4 hours on the phone with many agents. Every agent had a different story. Agents in the airport were over worked and unable to assist the large amount of stranded passengers who were all extremely unhappy. Absolutely no assistance was offered. No suggestions as to what do or where to go. I am shocked to be treated this way by Delta."
"""my second negative experience""","✅ Verified Review | Nashville to Charleston via Atlanta. This was my second negative experience with Delta within 4 months on two separate business trips. Last time I experienced a 6 plus hour delay and they kept reassuring us ""it would only be a little while longer"" then they cancelled the flight altogether. No offers were made at all to make any passenger feel better about their service, just a rebooking. Today travel was going smoother, I had a two hour planned delay and I asked a Delta rep if they could put me on a near empty flight that had seating available and left an hour earlier. I didn't even have a checked bag. I was treated rudely by Delta staff and told it was a $50 up charge even though I had no baggage and I explained my previous poor experience. You would think they would want to help a little at no cost to them. The Delta staff didn't care and didn't even offer to attempt to ask anyone what could be done. I'm not a rude passenger, just hoping they would help me out to have a better experience this time. I own a small business and I think it's a shame when a company becomes so large that common sense and courtesy to customers cannot prevail. I would be appalled if my employee treated my customer this way. I will be interested to see if Delta cares enough to contact me, if not, there are other airlines I can use for my business travel for me, my employees and my family. It's disappointing because as a loyal customer for years, I remember when Delta actually cared about their customers' experiences."
"""seats new and clean""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to San Salvador with Delta (Flight 729). The flight was onboard the newly retrofitted B757-200. The aircraft cabin was amazing. The seats were all new and clean, the mood lighting the overhead bins made the cabin look much more open and inviting. The flight crew was very helpful. All the flight attendants spoke Spanish and they assisted elderly and young passengers. The flight departed a couple minutes prior to scheduled and the captain kept everyone informed about the flight. Once airborne the flight attendants served us a sandwich, pretzels, cookies, and a snack size snickers with a beverage. This was good since the flight was a short international flight. Onboard every passenger also had access to inflight entertainment. The seats where more comfortable compared to the older B757s. Overall the Delta Air Lines experience has upgraded and was exceptional."
"""staff service unacceptable""","✅ Verified Review | I am a Delta Diamond Million Miler, and flew from Frankfurt to New York JFK. I realize Delta has some senior crews but the Business Class cabin crew on DL400/28Jul was beyond senior. I overhead a conversation with one stating she had been flying for 44 years, the other responded that she had ""over 50"" years on the job. Cabin service was atrocious - rude, uncaring, thrown at passengers with an angry glare and snatched away. When the purser was asked about a menu item she responded with, ""how would I know? I haven't looked."" Beverage refills were non-existent - even when I asked for another glass of water the attendant working my side neither acknowledged my request nor made any effort to fulfill it. A frustrated passenger finally asked the 50+ year attendant if she could hear him as she kept ignoring him and she responded loudly, saying just because she's German doesn't mean she doesn't speak English. There was no warmth or welcoming feeling on board - more of a challenging, ""us versus them"" sensation. Food was good, flight was on time - but staff service unacceptable."
"""attitude of staff disgraceful""","Delayed Delta flight from Las Vegas to JFK New York which resulted in a missed connecting flight to UK, the outcome a 28 hour delay. Extremely poor customer service from Delta staff. Offered no information or support told to find a hotel. Asked for manager twice told they were unavailable, had no wifi to call a hotel and staff would not assist. Given a red blanket and instructed to wait for next flight 24 hours! Spent 400£ on taxi and hotel missed day at work. To top it off my luggage is now in New York not UK, after being assured it would be on correct flight. Understand flight delays, however attitude of staff disgraceful, and won't use Delta again."
"""just terrible and unacceptable""","Miami to Los Angeles. Started off with a late departure from Miami, headed to LA. Flight information indicated an LA arrival of 10:20 pm, versus the originally booked ETA of 9:50 pm. No big deal. But, the way they staff handled boarding was so disorganized that we left much later than the (already delayed) ETD of 7:40 pm. It was like herding cats with many people being left with no overhead storage space. I was fortunate to have boarded with zone 2, but it was incredible how many carry bags and back packs that could easily fit under the seat in front of passengers wound up in the overhead. Thus, quite a long delay doing last second checking of bags. The pilot made up time and it was proudly announced we had landed in LA at 10:04 pm, roughly 10 minutes later than the original schedule. But, then we sat on the runway for two hours before finding a gate at the Tom Bradley International terminal. So, it appears our flight was sacrificed to avoid backing up other flights. We exited into the terminal (after midnight) to find (literally) wall-to-wall people waiting on flights. A serious mess. Then the long walk with our bags to get to a domestic terminal to pick-up our shuttle. When we were getting ready to exit the plane, the pilot came over the PA with a less than sincere, meaningless apology. This airline is horrible! The consequences for me were that I got home 3 hours later than I should have, after 1 am. But, other people on my flight had serious connection issues. Just terrible and unacceptable. I will never fly Delta again."
"""they were extremely rude and unhelpful""","✅ Verified Review | The worst nightmare flight I've ever been on. My flight from Las Vegas to Minneapolis was delayed one hour because they overbooked it. This delay set in motion a series of missed connection that made me travel for 2 days to my final destination! I was supposed to travel from Minneapolis to Paris but we were one hour late because they took of one hour late from Las Vegas. Not only that but when I arrived at the gate in Minneapolis they closed it 20 minutes prior to departure (the cut off time is 10 minutes) and forbade us to get on board. I'm pretty sure they ovebooked that flight and gave away our seats or sold them. It was 15 of us about 3 or 4 families with children and old people but they didnt care.They treated us like animals and called security on us when we asked to talk to the person in charge. Then they told us very dryly to go to the help desk where actually nobody was actually help you. They just gave you a phone number and let you solve your own problem so I was forced to stay on the phone for over one hour to try to rebook my flight and repair their mistake. I had to spent one night in Minneapolis and the next day they flew us to Salt Lake City where I had to spend 8 hours in the airport; the flight to Europe was delayed again 3.5 hours so by the time I arrived in Europe I missed my connection again so they rebooked me on a flight to Paris from Amsterdam. That plane too left one hour later than scheduled and my final plane had another hour delay to my final destination to Bucharest. All in all I had to change 5 planes and it took me 2 days and 4 hours to get to Bucharest from Las Vegas traveling with 3 minor children and a 72 years old. This is by far the worst airline I ever had to deal with and I will never fly Delta again. They were extremely rude and unhelpful, didn't care that it was their fault; they would lie to our faces that they are aware of our delay and we were already rebooked on a different flight. I had to do everything myself and run around in 5 different airports with children and luggage."
"""excellent service""","✅ Verified Review | Excellent service flying Delta domestic first class from Minneapolis to Omaha and flight landed early. Comfortable newer seats with the snappy red lined blue leather seats. Plenty of overhead space for my luggage. I am mid or top tier on three airlines in the US and travel multiples times a week for both business and leisure, so I feel I have a reasonable context from which to rate each experience."
"""seats were very comfortable""","Really happy with our Delta flights. Flew from Dublin to Atlanta on a A330-300 which was comfortable and had adequate leg room (I'm 6ft 1). Drinks were served 4 times and we were served food 3 times. The cabin staff were more mature and I always find they are a little more professional. A smooth on time arrival and we waited 3 hrs for our connection to Orlando. For the second flight we flew on a brand new A321 aircraft, the captain telling everyone it was the second day in service. The seats were very comfortable in Economy class and even when the person in front reclines you lose very little space with the way these new seats recline. The flight was only 85 minutes and it was turbulent for most of the flight which caused the staff to stop serving drinks before getting to us. No big deal and we landed safely in Orlando MCO for a 25 day holiday. All good for Delta Air Lines from us and we enjoyed the same quality service on our return journey."
"""decided to book with other airlines""","Boston to Raleigh Durham. Bigger issues at Delta now hurting loyal travelers. I travel frequently for work. I have been using Delta for a very long time and find it difficult to write but I am so underwhelmed these days. Several weeks in a row I have shown up to the airport and as soon as I approach the gate I find one of the following: Flight delayed for at least 4 hours : Flight Cancelled no rebooking for same day : Flight cancelled rebooking for following day. Show up following day and flight is delayed for 4 hours. Credit card got compromised either in the terminal as I waited during a delay or via inflight WiFi that I was compelled to purchase because I was delayed. Due to unreliability issues I have now decided to book my travel with other airlines."
"""received no help from them""","✅ Verified Review | Las Vegas to Los Angeles. We arrived at McCarran International Airport almost two hours prior to the scheduled departure time. My party had already checked-in online so we printed our boarding passes at the self-serve kiosks, and then dropped off our checked luggage. Once that was complete, we went through TSA/airport security, where the problem arose. There were eight people on our booking, however two of the boarding passes had not printed correctly, with the barcodes only printing halfway. As such, the boarding pass was unable to be scanned, and we were told to print out new boarding passes. We ran back down to the ticketing counter, had our boarding passes reprinted by an actual employee of Delta Airlines (not at the kiosk), and went back to TSA, only to find that this new boarding pass would not scan either. Again, we had our boarding passes reprinted once more, and again, it would not scan. The TSA officer stated that the issue was that there was no “destination” stated on the new boarding passes. We then had to go back downstairs to the ticketing counter, retrieve our original boarding pass with the faulty barcode, and bring them all back up to TSA. Only then were we allowed to pass through airport security. We reached the gate 4 minutes late, and were not allowed to board, even though the cabin doors had not been closed. During this time, our friends who had successfully passed airport security had been explaining to Delta Airlines employees at the gate, however they received no help from them. The Delta employee at the gate stated that all he could do was put us on a waiting list on the next Delta Airlines flight, which was already full, and that we should contact other airlines for a new flight. What was even more frustrating is that there was a delay, and the plane did not leave the gate for a further 20 minutes! I have sent two emails to Delta, and over one month later, am still waiting for a reply - I'm not holding my breath."
"""not plan to fly with Delta again""","Phoenix to Atlanta via Orlando. Had I seen the horrible reviews I wouldn't have booked with them. Delta Air Lines customer service is a joke when you try to get your issue resolved. My 12am flight was delayed until 9am and it kept changing every hour for 4 hours. So I didn't get the seats I picked, I was charged extra for room and reservation cancellations etc. Then all Delta could do was apologize and give me a $75 voucher. I don't want a voucher from you, I do not plan to fly with Delta ever again!"
"""space has been reduced""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Delta Air Lines from Seattle to Atlanta. The telephone service is absolutely terrible. I tried to call reservations multiple times over the past week. I had delays of 40 min to 2+ hours. Most time I could not get through. The space under the seats in the First/Business Class cabin on the B737-900 ER has been severely reduced. I do not know about the economy section. There are 3 black boxes under the seat and a 120 V plug. This makes it impossible to store anything under the seat ahead of an aisle seat. The space has been reduced in the right to left dimension and in the top to bottom dimension. In addition, the Boeing seat struts are poorly designed so that there is little space for the aisle seat under the seat ahead & there is dead useless space. In effect the under-seat space is divided into 3 compartments for the aisle seat. The 1st photo shows from right to left: the bar by the aisle, 1st black box, metal seat strut, 2nd black box. The 2nd photo shows the AC outlets at the top and the 3rd black box next to the other seat strut."
"""kept announcing incremental delays""","✅ Verified Review | Charlotte to Boston via Laguardia. Our flight was delayed twice, and we sat in the airport waiting, only to learn that the delay was due to mandatory 10 hour rest requirement for the flight crew. So they knew at least 10 hours ago the length of time the flight would be delayed, and did not post it or communicate it to passengers. They just kept announcing incremental delays with new departure times which were never going to happen, wasting everyone's time. We could have left home for our flight a couple hours later. They could do better."
"""Crew was friendly and funny""","Baltimore Washington to Atlanta. My first experience travelling on Delta Air Lines was very satisfying. I was going with hand luggage only therefore the check-in process worked perfect. Delta's Premium Economy are stylish as well as comfortable. Wifi is offered. No in seat screens but Delta Air Lines is offering entertainment via your own device - was working good. Crew on board was friendly and funny. My rating 7 out of 10 is only based on the very old aircraft!"
"""very disappointed with Delta""","✅ Verified Review | I flew from Baltimore to Atlanta on July 1st, and I had a connecting Delta flight to Amsterdam. I arrive in Atlanta at 1730 hours and was expected to go from Terminal A to Terminal F in 15 minutes which is impossible. Now it gets worse, no one in the Atlanta Customer service could help me they said pick up the courtesy phone and try to get another flight. The lady on the phone says they can not get me out of Atlanta until July 5th. I stayed on the phone for over an hour while she tries to find me a earlier flight. I said you are going to put me in a hotel for 2 days with no food. All I hear is I am sorry. She found a flight on July 3rd at 10:30pm. Then, they had to make another connection from Amsterdam to Kiev Ukraine final destination. I arrived at 0030 July 4th. I had a lot of family wondering where I was. They waited 12 hours for me. Maybe combining Air France, KLM and Delta is too much for 1 airline to handle. I was very disappointed with Delta."
"""horrible experience with Delta""","Again a horrible experience with Delta. After several terrible experiences that I personally had made in the past my family now got to experience the extremely poor customer service of this airline and its total disregard of its customers. My family came to visit me in CO from Europe, travelling Munich to Denver via Atlanta. After massive delay they arrived in Denver with 2 bags missing. We were assured the bags will arrive at my address the next afternoon. We had plans for that day and couldn't do anything but wait for the bag delivery. The bags finally arrived at midnight. One bag was severely damaged the other one completely destroyed. The pieces of the bag and its damaged and broken content were delivered in a plastic bag with a handwritten note that the bag was run over by a truck. We filed a claim with Delta online and received a confirmation email that they received our claim. After two weeks of no further emails from Delta we called several times to be updated on our case and how to proceed. Very poor customer service, extremely unorganized. Finally we were told that it will take 4 weeks for Delta to review the case. No apologies or anything. My family's vacation thanks to Delta wasn't the most pleasant experience. I will never fly this airline and never recommend it."
"""flight will not be leaving""","Montego Bay to New York JFK. Delta Air Lines flight was scheduled to leave about 1pm. When that time almost arrives everyone's curious as to why we haven't started boarding yet. They then announce mechanical issues, departure pushed until 4pm. 4pm arrives and the new part has been flown in from Atlanta. Delayed again. Around 7 or so we board the plane. Waited on the plane for another hour, then the captain announced that our flight will not be leaving Jamaica that night. They failed to properly install the replacement hydraulic. So we go back inside the airport, which is now closed. No more flights leaving or entering. They put us in a hotel which took forever (shuttles included). Many hard working adults had to miss work the next day which is unacceptable."
"""experience was adequate""","Los Angeles to Sydney in Business class. Liked the Delta One Kerb entrance at LAX T5. Staff theree organised by boarding pass for SYD-MEL on Virgin Australia. while I had cold glass of orange juice in their 'lounge'. Whisked through security with a minimum of fuss and went upstairs to the lounge. That was modern and spacious with enough variety in the beers, spirits and wines. Lounge had shower facilities, Wifi was very fast. However, the food on offer is far below what is available in the lounges in the TBIT. Boarded about 20 minutes late then sat for an eternity before takeoff. Left LAX an hour late which we did not catch up on the 14 hour flight which was probably due to head winds. Meal after takeoff was poor so I left it and went to sleep. Lie flat beds are ok, if a little narrow. Pyjamas, two pillows and a great duna provided me with the creature comforts and enabled me to sleep for ten hours. I had seat 9A which was tucked away in the back of the first section. It seemed to be more private than the other seats. As mentioned in my earlier review, I am not a fan of the reverse herringbone layout. I'd prefer either herringbone or the more traditional forward seating. Breakfast was just OK. Overall, the whole experience was adequate but nowhere near outstanding."
"""I will never fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Our original flight from Heathrow was supposed to be at 9am but was delayed until 6pm, we were told it was due to an electrical storm at JFK through other passengers, Delta never said anything. We had to go through multiple terminals and screenings because of our reassigned flight. We flew to Atlanta and we were told the next flight to Los Angeles was 12 hours later, we even tried other airports and either they had no flights or did not fly there. They messed up our luggage, one made it to Atlanta and the others are still in London. We asked about hotel and meal vouchers through a Delta representative and got none, we were told that they did not do that unless it was Delta's fault because it ""wasn't their fault"" and was claiming it was air traffic control's fault. After being up for 24 hours that was not the answer we wanted to hear. We were compensated at Heathrow by Virgin Atlantic with a more than fair amount for food vouchers just for a little delay. Delta again did not do anything. When we arrived at Atlanta nothing was open and we were hungry. I will never fly Delta again."
"""redone seats, excellent service""","✅ Verified Review | Cincinnati to Omaha via Minneapolis with Delta in First. Newly redone seats. Excellent service. A drink before we even departed. I am mid or top tier on 3 airlines in the US and travel multiples times a week for both business and leisure, so I feel I have a reasonable context from which to rate each experience."
"""very friendly and good service""","Salt Lake City to Atlanta with Delta. Very friendly and good service. My only complaint would be that the FA in First Class rarely cracked a smile when addressing passengers. However, he was friendly and constantly walked around to see if the passengers needed anything. This Boeing 737-9 was absolutely beautiful with a first rate inflight entertainment. The gate agent did announce that it was one of Delta's newer planes. It looked brand new. Of the major carriers in the US I would rate Delta ""ahead of the pack"". The flight departed and arrived on time."
"""decent amount of leg room""","✅ Verified Review | A bit of a late start due to mechanical, arrived on time with Delta Air Lines. Update announcements could have been more frequent. Decent amount of leg room for a small plane. Pleasant efficient cabin service. Short flight from Chicago to Cincinnati. Similar to other airlines with C700 equipment. I am mid or top tier on three airlines in the US and travel multiples times a week for both business and leisure, so I feel I have a reasonable context from which to rate each experience."
"""extremely unorganized""","Flew Raleigh–Durham to Jacksonville via Atlanta. I haven't flown Delta in a while due to previous poor experiences, this confirmed why I avoid them. Each flight was delayed and on the second flight they changed planes forcing seat changes without giving anyone a heads up until we scanned in. Once the second flight was delayed we eventually switched planes and gates. Not a big deal but boarding after that was extremely unorganized and took about 45 minutes to board a small plane only 75% full. My overall experience is sending me to other carriers regardless of cost."
"""4/4 flights were delayed""","✅ Verified Review | San Diego to Providence via Atlanta with Delta. We were traveling as a family to attend our son's graduation. We booked our trip in First Class as we consider coast to coast a long haul flight, and we like our comfort. Firstly, 4/4 flights were delayed. Delays due to weather, to not having a gate ready to disembark passengers, to long lines waiting to take off, to a faulty fuel cap, to missing paperwork, to delayed arrival of connecting aircraft, etc. Second, the seats in first class are hard as rocks, as well as cramped and narrow with insufficient recline. United gets the edge on this amenity, hands down. On the 4 aircraft we flew on, only two had entertainment systems. Only one of those two worked. On the other two aircraft, you may use your own device to access their new ""Delta Studio"", which offers ""free"" entertainment. However, the only entertainment value in Delta Studio is trying, and consistently failing, to get it to function. The icing on the cake of our tedious journey was on the final leg home. Our flight from Providence to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours, then rerouted off the Eastern Seaboard to a far western track south, causing more delay, bringing us in to Atlanta about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure of our last leg home. At the arriving gate, someone told us that if we sprinted, we just might make our flight, which at that point was listed as on time. We actually managed to get to our departure gate at about 10:30, which was scheduled departure. The genesis of the problems we encountered from here on began when we optimistically assumed that the gate agent at our delayed arrival gate had notified the departing gate that their 3 missing passengers were on their way. Alas, he did not. Gate agent at departing gate tells us that he reassigned 1 of our 3 first class seats to someone else, since we ""failed"" to make our flight, and that the only option left was a standby seat left in the middle seat of economy. So, my husband's seat was reassigned during our sprint to the gate and he gets downgraded. We asked if we would receive compensation for the downgrade. We asked if at least my husband could expect premium service in his new seat assignment. We asked if we could be rebooked on the next flight. Staff replies with chapter/verse about ""procedures"". My husband crams in to his middle economy seat, my son and I up in First, when a few minutes later, captain says flight was delayed due to fuel and paperwork."
"""seats were extremely comfortable""","Delta in my opinion, is the best american airline to fly transatlantic flights. Had a very cheap ticket for my vacation to Italy. On the first leg, I was seated in the very last row, and there was no window where I was sitting. The plane was very full, so I was not moved. The crew were nice and gave me extra snacks and drinks and apologized for the bad seat. The seats were rather uncomfortable, but they were tolerable for the flight time. Best part about the first leg was the IFE. Delta has free streaming from your device, so I was occupied during my entire flight. At JFK, we had a very short connection, of only 51 minutes, but the previous flight arrived 20 minutes early and the international flight left 20 minutes late, so we had plenty of time. Delta terminal at JFK, terminal 4, is nothing special, and lacks food options. The last leg, going to Pisa, was very good. The 757-200 is very good to fly transatlantic routes, and it had a new interior with mood lighting, IFE, and extremely comfortable seats. The touchscreen were very fast and responsive, with plenty of movies and other options. Dinner and drinks came out right away, and the options, the classic chicken or pasta, of which I chose chicken, was very good. Plenty of food and drinks to keep me satisfied throughout the 7 hour flight. I slept for 4 hours, which is a lot for me, I usually don't sleep on planes, but the seats were extremely comfortable. All the seats had USB and AC power, so I kept all my devices charged and ready for taking pictures. Flight arrived 20 minutes early, and all my baggage arrived, so I was very satisfied with this flight, much better experience than what can be found on American or United. Will definitely fly Delta and this route again."
"""100% of flights I booked, canceled""","✅ Verified Review | Wilmington to Portland (Maine) via La Guardia. Delta seems to be using a bait and switch booking for their flights. I booked this trip for my 90 year old parent and this is how she was treated. First early morning flight was canceled, no warning after she was already at the airport. Delta rebooked for the next morning. The next morning, the rebooked flight was canceled, again she was at the airport before they announced it. Delta rerouted her through multiple airports. It took another 12 hours to get to destination, so lost a full day and a half of vacation, plus the exhaustion and cost of multiple cab trips to and from the airport. Flight home, checked flight and said on time, got to airport - flight was canceled. Delta rebooked through another route. Got to second leg and connecting flight is canceled, so she is sitting at midnight in the airport, waiting again, exhausted. This makes 100% of Delta flights I booked, canceled after getting to the airport. ."
"""service was good, food good""","Sydney to Los Angeles with Delta. Although each seat in business class has aisle access, the reverse herringbone seating is a bid off to me. I like to look out of the window but with the reverse herringbone layout, it is difficult. I'd like to see each window seat pointing towards rather than away from the window. Service was good. Food good, cheese and crackers was great. Entertainment options were very limited. Movie choices, television shows and music album choices were all disappointing. Seat was comfortable but a little narrow. Not much in the way of storage space. My phone went flat over the 13 hour flight when plugged into the USB port. I'd give Delta a 7/10 on this flight. Not bad but nowhere near as classy as the likes of Singapore, Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa, Asiana, etc."
"""service is most disappointing""","✅ Verified Review | I fly quite a bit so I think I have a balanced view of what a fair service is. The return ticket business class Amsterdam to Portland was about 4500 euros, which is a lot of cash. For this amount you expect a good service, tasty food, friendly staff and up to standard infotainment and comfy seats. You might feel this coming but unfortunately its none of the above. The service is the part which is most disappointing: its unfriendly, after dinner they disappear and its really up to you to get any drink or food or about 3-4 hour when they appear again to get ready for landing. There is very limited choice of movies, seats are small and don't really flat-out. This whole package might have been good value in 1980 but its really outdated. Would definitely not recommend Delta Air Lines."
"""absolutely horrible service""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Atlanta to Cincinnati with Delta. There was only one lady working at the desk when there was a line of over 50 people even though there were two other computers available, which delayed the flight by at least 30 minutes. By the time everyone got on board there was a weather warning so each flight was delayed. Finally once the plane had been cleared for take off our plane was number 25 in line for take off. Absolutely horrible service. If the flight staff were aware there would be a delay they shouldn't have boarded everyone an hour and 15 minutes before the plane would even take off. So disappointed."
"""an overall good experience""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from San Diego to Atlanta nonstop and had an overall good experience with Delta. Flight was delayed slightly (less than an hour) after boarding, but the captain was diligent in relaying the delay and reason for delay. Captain also relayed information about storm systems over Texas upon takeoff. Due to the storm, seat belt signs were on for a long time, but this was understandable. I booked online, and my assigned seat only changed when they switched aircraft sizes well before the actual departure date. Crew offered snacks/drinks two or three times during the 4 hour flight. We landed appx. 15 minutes late. I only had a carry-on so I have no knowledge of checked baggage for this particular flight."
"""customer service was absolutely terrible""","I booked this flight from Phoenix to Charleston with Delta and packed a carry-on so that I would be able to get off the flight and leave right away. For some reason they had me check in my carry-on, which I thought was weird considering there was plenty of space in the overhead compartments. Checking in my carry-on caused me to be late for my appointment because I had to wait 45 minutes in the baggage claim area for it. Same thing happened on the way back home too, this time I asked to bring my carry-on with me because of my last occurance. They refused to let me even check to see if there was room for it, the customer service was absolutely terrible, and to top it off there was room again in the overhead bins."
"""better of the legacy US carriers""","Sacramento to Washington National with Delta. I log 40-60k miles a year with DL, not tons but not nothing using several classes (upgrades to F, Y+, Y). While far from perfect, they are the better of the legacy US carriers. On the positive side they seem to be pretty consistently on time, or close enough. I've had tight connections in hubs and never a problem, even though I've had to sprint on occasion. SLC is best, then MSP, DTW. ATL is spotty, LAX is definitely a problem spot. The cabin crew is far, far better on the whole than United. Much more professional and caring, usually well put together. While it's impossible to use miles (like all carriers it seems), they offer decent perks for status. On the negative side, they change their schedule all the time. Like, weekly, but tend to firm up about 10 days out (so more planning than execution). It can be problematic when your tickets come from a company travel service, since you'll need to go through them to re-accommodate. Skyteam coordination is hit-and-miss. Seamless with KLM, pretty good with AF, disastrous with AZ, inexistent with CZ."
"""cabin crew were efficient""","Travelled recently on Delta to Paris CDG, opting for the EWR flight as the time was more convenient than the earlier departure from JFK (I was using Delta Sky Miles for this segment). The Delta ""rotunda"" at EWR is actually a near-pleasant experience. For one, the departure time, just after 9pm, means its the last Delta departure out of EWR for the day and the entire security experience to gate was hassle free. The Amsterdam flight departs much earlier, at 6.30pm. The boarding area is standard Delta fare. There is a small Duty Free shop, some relatively tidy bathrooms, and one sports bar in the long corridor that leads to the gates. Boarding was chaotic (flight was full) and plenty of additional passport checks were conducted at the gate. Flight push back was delayed 35-40 minutes due to a Sofia bound passenger that didn't board, and the luggage had to be removed from the hold. The plane was a 1991-build 767-300ER, which once flew for Gulf Air. Delta has done a nice job of renovating the interiors and even Economy Class was decent. AVOD was great as was the USB port to charge your phone. Meal service was nothing spectacular, but did the job for what is a 6 hour 30 minute flight. Cabin crew were efficient, relatively friendly. Plane was in great condition. Arrived 25 minutes late and was on the curb within 15 minutes. CDG is an awful airport but for a point to point flight, it works."
"""I'm so upset right now""","I have never posted a complaint on any website for any reason. Until now. I am the most understanding and peaceful person I know, but I'm so upset right now that I'm posting this review right before we take off. Everything was fine until I started to board, and then right as I was about to scan my boarding pass, an employee grabs a tag and puts it on my carry on bag and says, 'all bags with wheels have to check'. I told him calmly that I don't want to check my bag because I don't have any checked bags. He forces the tag into my hand and says plane is full. So I walk down and leave my bag. I was a little upset, but despite his terrible communication and people skills, if it's full, it's full. So I board the plane and go near my seat and sure enough, there's at least three or four places where my bag would easily fit. I tell a flight attendant right away and they tell me that the checked bags have already been stored underneath, so I can't go get it. Why would he say that? And why not just ask me or talk to me instead of forcing me to do something that is not only obviously completely against my will, but also not necessary?"
"""excellent and friendly service""","Excellent and friendly service by the gate agent and flight attendants. My wife and I were greeted by name by the gate agent as we boarded. The FAs called us by name and constantly walked around to see if we needed anything. I would rate the food as above average. The fight departed Atlanta and landed on-time in Salt Lake City. Our luggage was delivered timely. The pilots kept the passengers informed during the flight. I would certainly rate Delta Air Lines higher than their competition."
"""Delta is laughable""","✅ Verified Review | Scheduled departure was at 9.10am. Departed at 10.15am because of paperwork issues. Upon entry into the plane it was filthy. Potato chip crumbs on my seat, oily screen, urine all over floor/toilet in bathroom which leads me to believe the plane was never kept or cleaned before our boarding. At 11.43am we were still on the tarmac and they said that something mechanical was wrong with the plane. We then returned to the gate. It is now 1.36pm and we have reboarded the plane. We still have not left. They are saying that they still have no further information. On top of that, the crew have asked us to have sympathy for them. Delta is laughable. I don't have sympathy for the crew. I have sympathy for everyone who has been patiently keeping their cool and have missed their connecting flights and their cruises."
"""extremely unhappy with Delta""","✅ Verified Review | Extremely unhappy with Delta. I had a so-so experience during a flight to Little Rock on a Delta partner a few years ago. This time around we flew into DCA. Upon departing D.C., we were delayed by inclement weather to a connection in Atlanta. Even though we selected an alternative flight upon self check-in, we received passes for the cancelled flight. Going to customer service was futile, the desk clerk literally told her supervisor she would not handle delayed flight cases. We got rebooked to a connection in Minneapolis, which Delta also cancelled. It took a further 2 hours waiting in a customer service line to get a solution. The customer service personnel proved absolutely useless, actually handing us a card to their 800 line because they were overwhelmed. The call also proved frustrating, it was only after thirty minutes of being put on hold and talking to an agent that we managed to get a connection to JFK the following morning. On other notes, Delta doesn't offer a free checked bag like many airlines. To check one bag is $25. The food on the flight to LAX was overpriced generic junk, think $12 for a wrap you could have bought for $5 at 7-11."
"""service on both flights was excellent""","✅ Verified Review | Denver to Manchester via New York JFK. Delta offer no lounge facility at Denver and nor do they offer any vouchers or other compensation for this - Not good enough. The airline brags a lot about its ability to stick to schedule and pulls one or two tricks to achieve this. We pulled back from the gate within a couple of minutes of schedule but then sat around for an age prior to taxiing. On time departure is calculated from pull back from gate, even if you go only a few feet. Service on board both sectors was excellent with very pleasant and efficient crew. Food offerings on both flights were very good and beverages were frequently offered. Denver to JFK was a midday flight and JFK to Manchester an overnight. Service on both flights was excellent. The lounge at JFK was welcoming and had a variety of hot and cold food on offer. Having eaten on the plane we did not bother with the offerings in the lounge. There is a complimentary bar service (you pay for premium and imported) with a good range of beverages supplemented by tea/coffee machines. The flat bed on both sectors was comfortable, IFE has a small selection compared to many airlines, not a problem for the overnight flight as I slept most of the trip. Bags were on the belt quickly in Manchester. Overall a good experience but Delta need to get lounge access at Denver."
"""frustrated and exhausted""","I just spent 12 hours on airplanes and in airports traveling from DCA to SFO and very few of them were pleasant. It started with a delayed flight that would have caused me to miss my connecting flight. I did receive email notice, but the itinerary was not rebooked. I went to do it myself but was unsure whether or not I could make the earlier flight and so I decided to wait to resolve the issue at the airport customer service desk. Apparently that was my fatal mistake. I arrived at the airport a good hour before the earlier flight's scheduled departure and proceeded to stand in line for half an hour at the desk while 1 customer service rep was struggling to manage a growing line. By the time the other representatives who had been walking in and out of the back room finally jumped in to help, I had tried and failed to rebook myself both online and on the phone, where the estimated wait time was 34 minutes. The representative rebooked me on the remaining itinerary available which was several hours later. After security I then stood in another customer service line for nearly an hour to receive my seat assignment. This flight was also significantly delayed, and even after boarding, we then sat on the tarmac for another hour because of first ""congestion on the runway"" and then ""inclement weather"". I also was asked to check my carry on due to space limitations, and when I protested explaining that I had an interview the next morning and my suit was in my carry on and I didn't want to risk the luggage being lost, the representative literally pulled my ticket out of my shirt pocket to check my name. We were all frazzled, but this really took me aback. By an act of God, my new layover was several hours and the gate happened to be right next to our arrival gate so I made the connection despite the two hour delay (on top of the delay from my original booking). This second flight was also slightly delayed and again I was asked to check my carry on. This time I relented after the representative offered that I remove my garment bag and she would hang it in first class. This rep is the only reason I'm giving a rating above the absolute minimum. Once we arrived in SFO the cherry on top is that we were forced to sit on the tarmac for another half an hour waiting for the arrival gate to open up. I'm not trying to be petty. I'm just legitimately frustrated and exhausted. Customers pay a lot of money for these flights. They don't have to be this painful and they shouldn't be. I'll be avoiding Delta in the future when possible."
"""staff courteous and professional""","✅ Verified Review | Though a frequent traveler this was my first experience with Delta flying from New Orleans to San Antonio via Atlanta. I found the staff courteous and professional. The aircraft carrier was very clean and comfortable. Unfortunately on my return the flight schedule got botched up because of bad weather in Atlanta. I had an international flight early the next morning, I went up to the service person who was prompt and courteous to re route me via Houston. He put me on United Airlines and I reached my destination 1 hour ahead of my actual itinerary."
"""it can only get worse""","This review is for an upcoming flight from Halifax to LAX via Boston. Since we booked the flight, Delta has changed the flight information 3 times, including cancelling 2 flights. The last straw was that after purchasing a ticket from Halifax to Boston in order to catch a flight on Delta from Boston to Los Angeles, this flight was also cancelled and we were asked to wait over 5 hours in Boston to catch a later flight. The Delta agent I talked to had no clue as to why the flight had been cancelled. Delta is the worst as far as reliable flights. The date is actually Oct 21, 2016 but the form would not allow future dates (this is about ticketing and flight cancellations in for a future flight - it can only get worse)."
"""usually avoid flying Delta""","Des Moines to Keflavik via Minnapolis with Delta. We usually avoid flying Delta. Couldn't avoid it this time, and all 4 of our flights/connections were terrible. The first time leaving Des Moines they over fueled by 4000 pounds and had to bump some people. The connection to Keflavik in Minneapolis they had to bump 18 people due to too much weight (making the flight late as well.) Coming back from KEF to DSM the flight was 40 mins late. Landing in DSM we have been sitting for an hour due to ""computer issues."""
"""I will fly Delta again""","Delta Air Lines from Munich to Atlanta on an old Boeing 767-400ER, flight time 9:50. Pre-Boarding in MUC I was surprised by the captain stepping outside the plane and anouncing the flight infront of the whole B-Gates. Crew was nice and welcoming. I preordered veggie food and tasted like it was bought at a Wholefoods market. I have seen better Entertainment Systems with a wider selection of movies and TV shows, but it worked out fine for me and was easy to use. Atlanta serves as the biggest Delta Hub and makes it quite easy to transfer. It is the busiest airport in the world, though, so short connections are usually not reached. ATL to CVG was on a MD88, not the newest aircraft but clean and on time. It was full, so some passengers were offered to check their bags during boarding for free. Onboard service like any other domestic airline, but onboard WiFi seemed to have worked good. When I came to the baggage claim at CVG, my bags were already there, waiting for me. My flight back to MUC was from PHL on the new connection via DTW. Flight from PHL to DTW was on a Boeing 717-200 and delayed by 2 hours due to heavy thunderstorms in PHL and temporary airport closure during that time. Not Deltas fault and they seemed to do everything they could to rebook passengers with tight connections at DTW. Aircraft used was small and again packed full. Again basic service. DTW serves as Deltas second largest hub and is easy to get around since domestic and international Gates from Delta and partners are just across the hall. DTW-MUC again on an old B767-400ER, but with flawless service and nice selection of beers and wines even in Economy Basic. Also love the fact that the B767 has only two seats in the outer rows, which makes window seats even more attractive. Flight was only half full with plenty of room for sleeping. Flight time 8:20 hours with a landing 20 minutes earlier in Munich than scheduled. Based on the experience I will fly Delta to the US again, because DTW seems a good airport to enter US soil and connect to different cities."
"""extremely uncomfortable relic""","✅ Verified Review | Delta Air Lines flight dreadful in every way. The all-economy-class CRJ200 should have been long retired. DL's (and other US carriers') continued use of this extremely uncomfortable relic on routes well over an hour long boggles the mind. The gate agent did not thank me in any way for being a gold elite frequent flyer in DL's program, and did not smile (the least she could do, given that there's no first class to upgrade into). My exit row seat (8D) had less legroom than regular non-exit rows on mainline aircraft. Extremely bumpy flight throughout. Bathroom at the back of the aircraft is incredibly tiny. My feet were freezing by the end of the one and a half hour long flight, because of the very cold airflow by the floor in the exit row (not sure if this was a specific issue with this particular A/C, or a problem with the CRJ200 in general). The pricing on this route does not make any sense (I paid as much for a coach one-way Detroit-Greensboro in coach as I do for roundtrip nonstops Detroit - Las Vegas in first class), lack of competition or high demand, perhaps. Take every effort you can to avoid DL on this route and the CRJ200 in general."
"""not very impressive""","✅ Verified Review | Delta is good for a US airline, but US airlines in general are not very impressive. I do prefer Delta to other US airlines, however. Flew Detroit to Shanghai. The leather seats are pretty nice, as they feel less dirty than the fabric seats can potentially be. The inflight entertainment had a pretty good selection, but the setup of the system was not the most convenient. In the economy cabin, you plug your headphones into the system itself rather than the armrest, thus if you need to let a passenger leave his seat, you have to unplug your headphones for him to do so. The food in economy class was just what you would expect of airplane food, nothing special. When boarding the plane, the cabin was disgustingly heated, as the air conditioning was not working very well on the ground. The air conditioning did work while in the air, however. The jumbo jet was among some of Delta's older aircraft, and Delta is planning to retire the remaining ones in their fleet by the end of next year."
"""10 hour delay, no hotel""","✅ Verified Review | Dallas to Louisville via Detroit with Delta. Flight was delayed for 6 hours for mechanical reasons. We were told before we left that there would be a hotel provided on several occasions. Once we arrived, we were told that there would be no hotel, but we were free to wait for the next 10 hours for our flight, but they did not know where our gate was."
"""disappointed and frustrated""","✅ Verified Review | New Orleans to San Jose with Delta. Very disappointed and frustrated with Delta. This was the first time I have had such a bad experience flying. I was supposed to arrive home by Monday evening, but the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to mechanical failure so I would be missing my connection. I was rerouted to go home via a different airport, but that flight was also delayed by 2 hours due to weather. After standing in line for 45 minutes and spending 30 minutes on the phone, I was rescheduled for a flight out the following morning. Delta at least covered the accommodation, but I had to contact my work last minute. I thought the saga had ended when I arrived back at the airport the next morning. I was in for a surprise. I called the central help line to see if I could get my bag checked for free, since I had purchased liquid souvenirs after passing security the day before. The agent on the phone said they would maybe reimburse me, but thankfully noticed that my flight out that morning was delayed by 2 hours. She made a very deft, last minute move to rebook me for an earlier flight out through a different city and I had to run through security to make that flight. Having reached my layover city en route home a day later than expected, I thought, ""I'm finally on my way."" However, Delta had the wrong flight information posted at the gates. I was not aware of the mixup until my name was called over the intercom for the final boarding call. I rushed to the correct gate and barely made it onto the aircraft on time. I was very very upset at this point. I had to conclude that since I had never experienced this type of delay-after-delay-after-mistakes before flying with other airlines, that it must be something to do with Delta. I would not fly Delta ever again. I am now home, 15 hours later than my original itinerary and exhausted from all the stress, uncertainty, and frustration."
"""staff professional and friendly""","✅ Verified Review | Bangkok to Indianapolis via Tokyo and Minneapolis with Delta Air Lines. Excellent lie-flat seats on both international sectors. Very roomy flat bed. Delta staff were professional and friendly. From Tokyo he captain talked to Business Class in person before take off. “We know you paid a lot for these seats and we want to thank you for choosing Delta. You keep us in business."" Then the spiel about the 4 pilots in the cockpit. Food very good. I ordered Lacto- Ovo Vegetarian meals. I arrived in Indianapolis on time and rested with all of my bags."
"""cannot get over the rudeness""","Toronto to Melbourne via Atlanta with Delta. The first leg of our journey was great. Helpful and friendly staff. The second part, however, became a nightmare of pure frustration. We had a 3 hour lay-over in Atlanta and went directly to our gate to wait. We had been told that we would get a seat assigned once there. When the boarding agents arrived at the desk, we politely asked for a seating assignment. We were brusquely told to just sit down and watch the screens. Our name would appear with the seating assignment. We sat and waited - and waited. Not sure of what was happening. We waited until the clerk was finished boarding one group and didn't seem to be too busy. We again, politely asked how this system worked and were once again rudely told to sit down. Finally, when they were calling for last minute passengers we went to the desk again. This time we refused to sit down. Eventually they found us two seats, one at the back and the other in the middle of the plane. We were the last ones on. I had just settled when the boarding clerk came rushing on board and forced me to move to another seat. By this time I was in tears. It's not as if we booked this ticket as a last minute. We had booked 6 months in advance. I cannot get over the rudeness and inefficiency of the airline personnel in Atlanta. Never again will I fly Delta."
"""Delta switched the aircraft""","Los Angeles - Orlando April 21st 2016 I had bought comfort seats, but when I boarded the plane I noticed that I was given two ordinary seats which did not recline and I was also separated from my wife. I am a 6.10ft tall, 70 year old senior. Delta switched the aircraft (Boeing 757 N552NW had a diferent configuration from the plane originally assigned for this leg, with fewer comfort seats) and no one warned me. As I got in I asked for assistance from the steward in attendance. He answered he had nothing to do with that adding he would have to be better paid by Delta to deal with such matters. Delta didn't warn me of the change in the seating category and the employee treated me with disrespect. I tried talking to the cabin chief and she offered me a glass of wine to solve the situation, which I refused. I was obliged to travel in a terrible situation."
"""pleased with the service""","Newport News to Denver return. I just want to say how pleased my husband and I are with the service we received by Delta. Our flight from Denver to Atlanta was delayed by over two hours, so we were going to miss our connecting flight from Atlanta to Newport News. The counter clerk in Denver was very kind, and went to work to see what she could do for us. She found us an earlier flight that allowed us to make it to our connecting flight in Atlanta. Had she not done that, our only other option would""ve been staying overnight in Atlanta to catch a new connecting flight. She also upgraded us to first class, and we received VIP treatment during the flight. Additionally, during that flight from Denver to Atlanta, there was a flight attendant who went above and beyond in making sure we had everything we needed. I was very dehydrated when I boarded the plane, and she showed genuine empathy and concern. She made sure I did not run out of water the whole flight, and asked several times how I was feeling. By the time we landed, I had greatly improved in how I felt! This flight attendant on DL1916, May 16th 2016 was great. I can't say enough about her kindness!"
"""reserve your seats on booking""","London to Tampa via New York JFK with Delta Air Lines. Flights were all on time, aircraft clean and seating space adequate. Pleased to see the plane was only half full so passengers could move to other seats and I was lucky enough to have the 3 middle seats to myself. Food was ok, usual chicken or beef but could not describe what vegetable was with it, plenty of drink runs throughout the flight with bottles of water offered and nice to be offered beer, wine or spirits for free on the international sectors. Inflight entertainment was excellent with a good choice of latest box office movies, tv shows also available, as on previous occasions disappointed with the music selections available. I like the fact that you can reserve your seats on booking, unlike some airlines who charge for this, or won't let you confirm seats until 24 hours before departure. Third time I have flown Delta and as long as their fares remain competitive will book with them again."
"""offered cramped conditions""","✅ Verified Review | La Guardia to Louisville. To my horror, I realised that my connecting flight was a codeshare with Delta. The staff were rude, and the poor management strategies were apparent from a quite empty plane that only offered cramped conditions (with no reclining options) to its passengers. To be fair, I was told that it would cost $50 extra to occupy an empty seat with the extra leg room, and chose not to pay the difference for an hour journey. It seems Delta management have missed out on $50, and confirmed their reputation, and earned a worthy review. The flight was delayed, and only about an hour late, so that was better than expected!"
"""risk of losing my business""","Atlanta to Paris with Delta - I have yet to travel but I have already had a poor customer service experience. I am a longtime American Express cardholder, a Delta SkyMiles customer, and a loyal Delta customer who carefully selected my seats the day I booked the trip a month and a half ago. I received a confirmation e-mail noting the seats we had selected as well. When I logged into the Delta website I learned that Delta had moved one of our seats, separating us. This is a very special trip, a 30th birthday celebration, and it is very important that we sit together. The staff treated me horribly, were unwilling to do anything to change the seats, and did not do anything to offer to help. If Delta is not able to retain me as a customer, they are at risk of losing my business."
"""no porters or wheelchairs""","Horrible! I made this flight reservation from Tampa to Detroit for my father. I spoke to Delta Reps on the phone when I made his reservation. I specifically told them he needed wheelchair assistance to the gate and onto the plane and the same assistance with deboarding and getting to baggage claim. He arrived over 2 hours early for his flight. When he got to the airport there were no porters or wheelchairs at the curb to help him. When he checked in at the ticket counter the Rep told him that he only had economy seating left and a window seat at that and there was no way to get him an aisle seat and on top of that the Rep also told him they were short staffed and didn't have a wheelchair for him. He then told him ""you better head over to security because it's a long wait and if I find a wheelchair I come get you""."
"""offers a good product""","✅ Verified Review | Roundtrip with Delta from Frankfurt to Las Vegas via Detroit and San Francisco to Frankfurt via Atlanta. Overall a good experience. All flights on time or even ahead of schedule. Transfers at Detroit and Atlanta were easy and smooth. Delta has well organised hubs with plenty of ""Need Help"" centers. Staff is fantastic from check-in to flight attendants, always friendly, attentive and willing to help. Long-haul flights were on an older B767-400, but cabin was modern and well maintained. IFE was good with a wide selection of movies, but only 4 (FRA-DTW) and 2 (ATL-FRA) in German language. Meals were tasty and beverage service very generous on intercontinental flights. Beer, wine and spirits were free, served in the biggest plastic cups I ever got in economy class! Also water cups or bottles were offered by cabin crew every 45-60 minutes. US flights were a bit different. Planes (B737-900) were new, with IFE at every seat. Some movies were free, some you had to pay for (6$). There were a lot of movies available in German language (20-25), more than on flights to Germany. Free drinks and snacks (pretzels, cookies, peanuts) were offered several times, but you have to pay for alcoholic beverages and ""real"" food. Food offers were expensive and selection was rather poor. There is a lack of fresh food (e.g. salad) or hot meals, most offers included industrial food like crackers and crisps. That was the only negative aspect of my journey, in total Delta offers a good product."
"""really took care of us""","Our Delta Air Lines flight out of Seattle to Bismarck was delayed five hours, but they switched our flights no problem and included free pizza before the one that was delayed! Never seen that before. And we got a $200 gift card for our trouble! The delay sucked but they really took care of us."
"""beg people to trade seats""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Portland with Delta. We had infant in arms. They split us up and weren't able to sit us together. We had to beg people near us to trade seats because no one wanted to sit in the middle. It was night flight and the kid was cranky. When we landed the new stroller was scratched up, dirty, and not taken care off. Couple years ago Delta had delayed flight and didn't provide us hotel since the flight was in 8 hours. We thought something changed since those couple years, but guess not."
"""always cordial and efficient""","Flew Six segments on Delta from Michigan to Honolulu via Los Angeles, five on time and one with a 30 minute delay, no missed connections. I remain very impressed with the Delta ground staff and onboard staff that I come in contact with. Always cordial and efficient. Besides the beverage cart pass in the first hour and last hour of all 4 to 6 hour flights, the attendants passed water and/or coffee at least twice. The domestic B767 aircraft was showing it's wear, particularly with the IFE, which worked OK at best, but it was clean and everything worked. The internationally configured B767 is very nice, with new, comfortable seats, a large screen and excellent movie choices (to and from HI they are complimentary). The one weakness was a flavorless Asian-inspired chicken wrap (so-called) that I purchased. I'm not sure why they settle for such mediocre catering."
"""you get what you pay for""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Buffalo to New York City. I understand that you get what you pay for and that is exactly what happened here and every time I've flown with Delta Air Lines. I have not had one smooth flight or flight on time. First flight went out 20 minutes past departure and the return flight was almost 2 hours delayed. This is unacceptable. I could have driven with less headaches."
"""stewardesses were great""","✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Dublin return with Delta, and travel to and back the seats were changed, but still were able to not only stay in Premium Economy, but in the two seat arrangement. DUB to JFK was in bulkhead seats with great leg room, but the meal tray was an issue, should one be lets say on the heavier side; I had set up the seats a few months ago. Customer service on the phone upgrading to Premium Economy was easy. Flight was good, stewardesses were great, extra leg room and seat comfort with the pillow they supply was decent, movie selection was good, watched two going over, three coming back. I have a gluten intolerance and received my food a bit earlier and it was actually pretty decent. The priority check-in, especially at JFK with the shorter TSA line was really nice, the bottled water at check in was just a plus. Flying again in a few months in Premium Economy and looking forward to it, especially since the flight will be an A330."
"""welcoming, friendly crew""","Felt like I hit the lottery with an internationally configured 767 from Honolulu to LA. With a lie flat seat I was already happy. Add to that a welcoming, friendly crew, very good food and a great video selection accompanied by very rare WI-FI over that section of the Pacific. LA to Vegas was short and sweet and comfortable with another warm group of attendants. Only negative comment is about the shabby Honolulu Airport which is not Delta's fault."
"""every single flight was delayed""","I had my first introduction to Delta Air Lines for a weekend trip to San Francisco. I had 4 flights in total and every single flight was delayed. I've never had such a bad experience with an airline and don't intend on flying with this company again. It's one thing to be delayed for 15-30 minutes for traffic delays and a whole other ball game when you're sitting in the airport for multiple hours waiting for a return flight to Canada. Don't recommend Delta to anyone."
"""so much for goodwill""","Delta Sky Club admission policy is inconsistent. If you fly in first/business domestic in the afternoon and then fly international the very next morning, all within 24 hours, you are not entitled to use the Sky Club lounge. However, if you make the same flights all in the same day, you can use the Sky Club lounge. Now, even if the policy is inconsistent, you would hope the lounge staff could use some customer-friendly judgement and make an exception to let you in. No such luck at the DCA lounge. So much for goodwill. Sent an email to Delta customer service. We'll see if they are any better at dealing with customers. Next time I have a similar itinerary, I'll try a different airline."
"""forced to take off work""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from St Lucia - O'hare (Connecting flight in ATL). Only flew because the resort had an exclusive with them. Lost bag in ATL in the layover. They finally found it in ATL, and gave me the hours of 8:00am - 8:00pm to be delivered the following day. They would give me a call from an unknown number, but if I didn't answer, they wouldn't deliver it. Since I have a job and don't sit on my phone all day, my other option was for them to leave it at the front porch. I don't know about you, but I don't like my belongings just hanging around the front porch all day, so was I forced to take off work. I found Delta's customer service to be a joke when trying to get compensated for my lost wages. You call into one dept, with no managers, only to be told I have to put a complaint through their website. If you wish to follow up, you'll get the runaround. Once you put a complaint through their website, you'll get an email back from a general email stating, ""We don't offer reimbursement"", but thanks for paying $1500, along with the bag fees and inconvenience we caused you, but please fly again. You are unable to contact anyone via phone. Apparently, their corp center with the employees sending these emails, don't have phones. There's no phone lines to their Corp Center, so they can just hide behind general emails and deny people. 2nd time they lost my luggage. I can't understand why Delta is still even around."
"""split up, some put on standby""","✅ Verified Review | I would not recommend to my worst enemy. We booked return flights for a family of 6 from Leeds Bradford to Orlando, flying Delta from Atlanta to Orlando, Orlando to Boston and onward to Amsterdam in November 2015 on a single booking reference and e-ticket, and later booked actual seats. We were split up, some put on standby and some not even on the system despite checking the bookings before starting to travel. At Boston the seats we originally booked could not be given to us as they were ""blocked"" for families. what are 2 grandparents, mother, father and seven year old twins? The seats allocated to us were 2 of the original at the side of the plane, 2 in the row behind the original, the mother moved to economy after being on standby and a seven year old girl to travel by herself. At Amsterdam 4 were on the plane seated in different seats, one was on standby despite the plane being overbooked and one not even on the system"
"""will never fly Delta again""","✅ Verified Review | Philadelphia to Phoenix, and I will never fly Delta again. I traveled with my wife and child. We were not able to sit together unless we paid more money. We got to the airport and got in line to check in. We waited 10 minutes and then were told we had to have boarding passes to be in that line. We finally got them and then we're told we had to pay $100 extra dollars because our bag was a pound over. The Delta employee was rude. We heard nothing but no no no. It was as if it was a luxury for us to pay hundreds of dollars to fly. Flying to and from we had a connecting flight. Each time we were sat in the last row and had to sprint to our next flight. We barely made our connecting flight home. Because we were in the last row and our connecting flight was in a terminal farthest away from us. Delta aren't family friendly."
"""always a nice experience""","✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Frankfurt with Delta. Awesome service, flight attendants are helpful, polite and efficient. Flight entertainment is nice and the food was tasty. Flat bed seat was very comfy. Flying Delta airlines is always a nice experience. Ground crew is nice and willing to help. Lounge is nice and clean, with nice food selection."
"""enough legroom and space""","✅ Verified Review | Delta is always an excellent experience I flew from New York JFK to Boston and found the flight crew nice and friendly. Even on a short flight the attention you get from the flight attendants was excellent. Seats were nice and comfortable, enough legroom and space. Ground crew were helpful. I have flown with many airlines and I still think Delta is one of the best."
"""get booted from your seat""","✅ Verified Review | Phoenix to Minneapolis. Delta has started the policy of making you recheck in at the airport when they've had a ""plane switch."" This means that if you check in online, you'll likely get booted from your seat, even though you checked in before others who waited until they got to the airport, and technically made it easier for Delta. I got booted from a seat that I'd booked over a month in advance for both legs of a trip from Minneapolis to Phoenix, and both times they moved me to the back of the plane (from the front/middle like I'd booked). I have both the Delta app and Tripcase, and Delta has my phone number and email on file. Despite getting to the airport over 4 hours before my flight, I received no warning about this at all until the airplane started boarding, at which point they sprung this on me, with no recourse. Meanwhile, all the people who got to the airport after me were moved up."
"""comfortable enough seats""","I flew Delta Air Lines on 2 economy class legs from Newark to Kansas City through Detroit on B717s. The aircraft's are a bit older but are kept in great shape, with comfortable enough seats. The crew were quite friendly and were prompt with their services and trash pickup. Both flights left and arrived on time, and with wifi on board there isn't much to complain about."
"""fly Delta in the future""","Detroit to Las Vegas return with Delta. Chose economy comfort+ and very glad we did. Three of us had plenty of room and priority boarding. Both flights were smooth and pretty much on time. FA's were friendly on both trips but the outbound crew seemed to be a bit more attentive. Will fly Delta in the future."
"""cannot recommend Delta""","This six hour leg from Minneapolis to Anchorage was the worst flight I have taken in a decade. For some unknown reason, Delta chose to put an aircraft with no power outlets and no USB connection on a 2500 mile route. The seats were hard and had limited recline. The meal service, when it finally came, was appalling. No nuts or pretzels were offered with drinks. The meal had no appetizer, no bread, the portions of the main course were tiny and unappetizing, and the dessert was some kind of nasty lemon gelatto that was half melted. The cabin crew was surly, indifferent, and hid behind the curtains in the galley for most of the flight. After several hours of no service, one water run was made before landing. And this was in First Class no less ! I cannot recommend Delta under any circumstances."
"""the lack of compassion""","Charleston to Los Angeles via Atlanta with Delta. Missed our connection by 10 minutes. When we deplaned in Atlanta we are told to check our connection on the board. We ran to our connecting flight and arrived 8 minutes before leaving. We are told the gate was closed and to go to the Delta counter for rebooking. The gate attendants responded as if this happens all the time. We are not young but even worse than that were the families with young children and the lack of compassion they are given. Did I mention or connection was late because we waited for someone in Charleston. Is this how Delta in Atlanta treats families and older people? Appalling."
"""lack of food service""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to New York with Delta Air Lines. My husband and I were extremely unhappy with the lack of food service on this transcontinental flight. We paid for Premium Economy with the understanding that there would be complimentary food included. I asked at the gate to be sure and was told we didn't have to bring any food on board. To add insult to injury, there is food included on flights to California. What kind of nonsense is this? The movie selection was only mediocre, in addition. We're not eager to fly Delta again, and we do make frequent trips to Seattle because we have family there. We're not giving Delta a good review with our friends either."
"""not a good experience""","✅ Verified Review | This flight was booked through Virgin but they didn't do flights from Manchester to New York, so they use Delta Air Lines. My daughter and I were sat on seats behind the seats where the exits were and it was very cold as is usual. The blankets provided were not adequate to keep out the cold even though we had a couple each. The seatbelt sign was on for a while after take off but people were walking up and down and the staff didn't say anything to them. The exit area was blocked with litter but the staff did not make any attempt clear it away. The food was not worth eating, it was cold, dry and hard. I felt as though I was flying with a second rate airline, the cabin staff didn't speak and look thoroughly miserable. Not a good experience flying with Delta."
"""displeased with my Delta experience""","Montreal to Spokane via Minneapolis, and extremely displeased with my Delta experience. Landed in MN to find the connecting flight tone delayed about 45 min because there was no pilot. Ok. Not a huge inconvenience. Board the plane to find out that I have been bumped from the aisle seat I specifically selected when booking the ticket and as the flight was full, was unable to get a aisle seat. Then we sat on the plane for almost another hour when it was announced due to a fuel leak we would have to deplane and take another plane. Extremely inconvenient as the flight is already terribly uncomfortable with the small space and terrible seats. And of course there is no compensation to passengers for the inconvenience. So all-in-all, will try to avoid flying delta for future travel needs when possible."
"""not willing to work with me""","The flight from Indianapolis to San Diego was fine. Then I had a 6:30am flight back to Indianapolis and needed to be home that evening for work early. I missed my flight - my fault. Delta was unwilling to let me transfer my fare for a fee or give me any kind of credit and said my only option was to purchase a first class ticket for $1,200. It was very upsetting that they were not willing to work with me at all."
"""just lost this family's business""","Kahului to Portland, and Delta's flamboyant and fantastical lack of customer service has left me absolutely gobsmacked. Understandable that equipment changes do happen, but the fact they cannot manage to seat either my wife or I next to either our 5 or 8 year old after repeated customer service calls and subsequent ticketing agent and gate agent visits is absurd. In fact they are comfortable with not a single member of our family sitting in the same row (despite having a saved seats together when the tickets were purchased 6 months in advance thru their website) instead they have seated our children separately 5 and 6 rows behind the closest parent and stated we are welcome to ask those around us if they are willing to trade for our newly assigned middle seats for the 6 hour flight, good luck. Congratulations Delta, you have just lost this family's business for life! I'm confident based on past experiences this situation would never have been handled in this manner by Alaska Airlines."
"""never fly with them again""","I flew from Atlanta to JFK on 11th July 2015. As we were about to board the plane at the door (I was travelling with my 14 year old daughter), I was told I had to check my hand luggage into the hold and it would be sent on to my final destination, which was Dublin. I tried to explain that we had packed valuables into our had luggage and other items needed to complete our journey to Dublin. At this stage the staff became quite aggressive and told me to either check the bag or go back up to the gate. Again I tried to explain about we had packed all our valuables etc into the carry ones at which stage he told me I wasn't allowed to get on the flight and to go back to the gate. I had a connecting flight to catch once arriving in JFK so I had no choice to check in the carry ones with all the things inside them. His response was he didn't care what I had in the bags and they had to be checked. I could not believe how he spoke and treated us it was appalling. I spoke to the attendant when we boarded the plane and she said there was still plenty of room and they had not instructed the gate to do this. You can imagine how I felt when we arrived at our seats and not only was the overhead bin empty but wasnt even used during our flight by any other passengers. I will never fly with them again - I have no complaints with the service or crew on the actual flight but I am the ticket agent in Atlanta and Delta's lack of response (not even an email) put me off ever flying with them again."
"""just gets worse and worse""","The service, attitudes, quality and overall experience just gets worse and worse. On my outbound flight from MEM to LGA we were more than an hour late leaving MEM. As a result, we got into weather and air traffic issues at LGA resulting in landing at EWR for fuel. We were 2.5 hours late arriving at LGA. All you get from DL: ""sorry for the inconvenience."" The return flight from LGA to MEM was cancelled. No reason given when I asked two different people. DL tried to put me on a flight the next day rather than rebook me the same day. I had to jump through hoops just to get out on the same day. Had to fly EWR to DTW then DTW to MEM. The flight from DTW to MEM was almost an hour late because one of the flight attendance was a no-show. Add to that the fact that the seats are terribly uncomfortable (exit row aisle) and the service is non-existent. DL is the king of excuses and ""I'm sorry."" I do my best to avoid them."
"""customer service is abysmal""","Delta continues to deliver sub-par service. I fly under government negotiated fares for domestic travel on a regular basis. The ticket booked was for San Diego to SLC on a Delta flight, and from SLC back to San Diego via SEATAC on a delta booked ticket on Alaska Airlines. On the way out, the flight was delayed on departure. No reason was given. On the way back, I ended up finishing early. I called Alaska to try to shift to an earlier flight. As expected, Alaska picked up in a couple of minutes. I attempted to utilize the Alaska Airlines same day ticketed change program to move to an earlier, direct flight back to San Diego, but the relationship with Delta made it so their system wouldn't process the change without cancelling my ticket and rebooking. They told me to call Delta. I called Delta, but was immediately put into the que. Rather than wait I opted to take the call back. It took them more than 30 minutes to call me back. Fail on customer service. When they did call me back, they first tried to charge me a $200 change fee on a government fare. This isn't allowed under their negotiated contract, but I had to argue with them to get them to realize this. If I hadn't known this, they would have tried to shove that down my throat. Then they told me that even without the fee, it was going to cost $200 + to change my ticket due to a difference in fare. Their excuse was that I didn't have a reservation when I had just given them a ticket number. At this point, the conversation ended due to a clear issue with them being able to do their job and me being unwilling to pay for something that would have been free had I booked my entire trip with Alaska airlines in the first place. I recommend not flying Delta Airlines if it is at all avoidable. Their customer service is abysmal and their planes are dated and poorly appointed."
"""third world service""","Tucson to Atlanta with Delta. Bought seats in first class, onboard the toilet was inoperable and stank! Cabin crew said they had attempted to reject the aircraft but were threatened by company management. Cabin crew then had to delay food service to allow first class passengers to use aft lavatories. Truly third world service!"
"""concerns were ignored""","We will never fly Delta again. We made our reservation for our trip of a lifetime a year in advance. At the time that we made the reservation, we decided to pay a little extra for ""comfort seats"". We also wanted to make sure that there were enough seats available for us to be able to be seated together, then being able to share the joy of our trip. Without notice, on our trip from Seattle to Lihue, where we changed planes, our seat assignment was changed and we were separated. We really wanted to be together inasmuch as we could then lift the arm rest between us and possibly sleep more comfortably. We also felt that as senior travelers, there might be some accommodation for our desire and need to be together. Our concerns were ignored. Now, we have learned that again, our seat assignment for the last leg of our flight home has been changed. We are particularly alarmed that not only was this done without being notified, but also, without any compensation whatsoever offered. Three separate complaints have been filed, all to no avail We have been told that all we are guaranteed is a seat and that our having chosen seats well in advance of our trip has no meaning, nor do they care whether we are senior travelers. They have refused to listen or pay heed to our concerns, and we are livid. Delta offers no such thing as customer service, period. Never again will we fly Delta Air Lines."
"""fine experience over two flights""","Paris to Salt Lake City, and I would like to thank Delta for a fine experience over two long flights. Our group of 8 were well looked after by hard working efficient staff. Entertainment worked really well to help pass the time. Would be glad to fly with Delta again. Got a pleasant surprise as I've dreaded longer flights in the past"
"""would not travel Delta again""","Los Angeles to Las Vegas. No complaint about the flight except for no refreshments offered. However check in at Los Angeles was appalling. We had been unable to check in prior to arrival at the airport. There were no staff available to advise where to check in and had to join the Special Services queue. Had to queue for 45 mins and agent was unable to print my onward boarding card for flight from LAS to Gatwick though she printed my husband's. She said that this sometimes happened and didn't offer to try again. On reflection we decided this wasn't acceptable as we would have a short turnround time at Las Vegas but I didn't want to have to join the end of the special services queue again! Luckily managed to find a Delta employee this time who was extremely helpful and printed out the boarding card without any trouble. Very unacceptable experience altogether though especially if we had not allowed a great deal of extra time to check in. I'm sure many people must miss their flights through the queueing system at delta desks at LAX. Would not travel Delta again."
"""provided a very high standard""","Minneapolis to Las Vegas and a very nice flight with Delta. Staff was nice and gave us drinks before takeoff. It was my first flight in first class and I didn't know what to expect. Delta provided a very high standard for me. Inflight entertainment was nice too. Good choice of movies and tv shows for all."
"""significant improvements""","I was impressed with the significant improvements in Delta's transatlantic service since the last time I flew them. The 767s, though old, now have personal IFE installed, with clear, sharp screens. Movie selection was good. Catering has improved as well, with decent wines and spirits served (instead of wine out of a box!). The food could be further improved however, and the bagel served for breakfast was memorably bad, rock-hard and cold. Crew were professional, though some of the more senior crew were on the brusque side. Overall, I was impressed on my flight from Atlanta to Paris that Delta's service is finally on par with the European carriers."
"""a very good experience""","My wife and I flew Delta from Spokane thru Seattle to Honolulu return and had a very good experience both ways. They ask for 15 people to check their carry-ons because of the full flight. When I went up, she noticed that we were not seated together and move us up to the bulkhead with greater legroom for the long flight. Very welcomed for my long legs. The flight attendants kept us watered and fed and were very pleasant. On the return trip, a similar thing happened, as I noticed we were assigned seats a row apart. I approached the countered and ask if we could possibly be moved to the preferred seats again without paying the $99 up charge, and she said no, but she would try to get us seated together. She came through with the extra legroom seats just before we boarded. Overall, a very good experience."
"""will most likely avoid""","There was a 70 minute delay from Columbus to departure. Got to Atlanta with 20 minutes to spare to catch my next flight to Liberia, CR. I tried to ask a question about my luggage to the attendant, she ignored me and the pilot, who was the last one off the plane actually was the one who helped me and said that my luggage would be automatically sent to my final destination. Got to my terminal with 5 minutes to spare, the lady at the desk smugly said the door is closed and the lady next to her could help me. I understand there will be delays due to weather, but I've missed my flight and had to deal with the same issue, being stuck at airports the last 3 times I've flown with Delta. Customer Service is poor. Flying out of Columbus, I couldn't check in using the machine, and the agent was also very condescendingly saying why didn't I use the machines or the other lines. There seems to be a reason why Delta is cheap, and will most likely avoid Delta from now on."
"""worst travel experience""","New Orleans to New York with Delta Air Lines, and a delayed flight which finally took off after 4 hours only to be diverted to Harrisburg at midnight. An entire plane of passengers was then abandoned at the airport. Not a single customer service rep was available to help or advise. The worst travel experience of my life."
"""had everything we needed""","We flew with Delta from Amsterdam to New York JFK and everything was fine, luckily the flight time was not that long, as the economy class was very crowded. The meal was ok, we had everything we needed including an IFE with latest movies. The landing at JFK was a bit rough, but no harm done. Would fly Delta again, I would say they are the most reliable US airline at this point."
"""ignored my girlfriend and I""","Punta Cana to Minneapolis with Delta. First thing my girlfriend and I were separated which not a big deal I asked the people next to us and they were a couple and didn't want to move so I asked the attendants to ask some people for me. They asked the couple I already talked to within 10 seconds of me asking, and then just said there is no one who wanted to switch - they didn't even try. After that they told us the WiFi was free which its not. They ignored both my girlfriend and I for food and drinks through the trip. Then I tried to use the call attendant button to which I turned off after 30mins."
"""experience was positive""","I flew with Delta Airlines in Feb 2016 from London to NYC return and the experience was positive. Our check in was quick with no delays and our flight ran to time. Our flight was only about 40% full and it was nice to have the extra space. Flight attendants friendly and attentive. We got given a blanket, pillow, eye mask and headphones. Each seat had a TV with a great choice of recent movies. We were given nuts and pretzels, biscuits, lunch (lasagne, salad, bread roll, cheese and biscuits), ice cream, brownies and cheese and ham bap. We were also offered drinks. I will be flying with Delta again, thank you for a great experience."
"""lack of concern for customers ""","Salt Lake City to New York. Plane was extremely hot and uncomfortable. On the flight to Salt Lake City they kept us on the runway for two hours and ran out of all food and beverages before they even had the chance to service half the plane. Shows very poor planning and lack of concern for customers comfort and well being."
"""offering excellent service""","London Heathrow to Las Vegas via Seattle, returning via Minneapolis in economy with Delta. Friendly crew offering excellent service on all flights. Food was of a good quality and very appetising. Onboard entertainment was excellent, lots of movie and TV choices available with complementary headsets on the international routes. Connections were quick and painless and information was clear."
"""crew should be more polite ""","Very pleasant flight. Departed from Dublin on time and landed thirty minutes early in New York JFK. Cabin crew was bit rude toward an elderly passenger who was not able to lift her own cabin bag and fit it into the overhead compartment. Cabin Crew said that insurance wold not cover her sick leaves if she get injured by lifting the bag. Breakfast was very poor - only a really hard bread with cheese and a frozen orange juice with yogurt. Ticket was really cheap and my experience was good with Delta. I will fly with them again but the crew should be more polite and kind to passengers."
"""Delta helped the situation""","San Antonio, TX to San Jose, Costa Rica. A volcano erupted in Costa Rica the day I was suppose to arrive causing my flight to delay twice because of ash in the air. The first night we were stuck in Atlanta and Delta provided us with discounts for nearby hotels and an overnight bag with toothpaste, toothbrush, brush, tshirt, etc. I chose to stay in the airport as the flight was rescheduled really early the next morning. The next morning while still in the air the pilot got word that the airport had not opened as planned so we had to land 4 hours away in the Liberia airport in Costa Rica. This would be a stressful situation for anyone in a foreign country without international calling to contact people back home. But instead of leaving us in Liberia until the ash cleared (which would've been like two days later) Delta helped make the situation easier by paying the fare for us to ride an air-conditioned charter bus all the way to our intended airport in San Juan. The airline was very clear and helpful throughout the situation. The rest of my trip went smoothly and so was my ride back home."
"""my bag never made it""","Hartford to Ft Lauderdale. First, the flight got delayed at DBL due to the lack of staffing to deice the plane (according to the captain). The flight scheduled for 6:25 pm left at about 8:00 pm. They try to hide behind bad weather (a light snow shower). Second, the connection flight in Atlanta was delayed too. The flight scheduled for 10:45 left at about 1:30 am the next day. They had more than sufficient time to transfer out luggage but they didn't. A real mess when boarding the passengers, the staff do not have a clue how to work. Finally, my bag never made it to Ft Lauderdale from Atlanta despite the large amount of time between connecting flight and their lack of efficiency. My bag was recovered by Delta at 11:00 am and given to a driver to deliver it to me. It is 6:30 pm and my son and I are without our much needed personal things thanks to this airline inefficiency and the people working for it."
"""crew friendly, approachable and helpful""","Booked these Delta flights through the Virgin Atlantic web site travelling Heathrow to Palm Beach via Atlanta. No complaints whatsoever about the aircraft, check-in staff or onboard crew. In fact it was a pleasure to fly with Delta - the cabin crew on all flights were friendly, approachable and helpful. It is also nice to sit in business class seats which all face forwards. Entertainment system ok, great selection of films not so for the music. If you are planning to fly with Delta compare the prices on both Delta's web site and Virgin Atlantic's to ensure you get the best deal."
"""there were no apologies""","Delta Air Lines is by far the worst airline to fly on. After boarding our flight for Miami to Georgia and waiting for over 4 hours, it was announced that the plane would not take off. There were no apologies, no beverages offered and the customer service was anything other than available, let alone polite. Our luggage was lost and there was not one person in sight to help aid us. The lines were horrendous and most others were having the same issues/complications."
"""they did not care""","I fly from Philadelphia to Phoenix I was waiting one hour in the airport then I have to wait one hour inside the plane just to take off. I lost my flight - it was very difficult to get help, every time I try to get help the answer that I got was that there was more people on same situation. I got no remedy, no help. I was stuck on the airport for 19 hrs - no one offers a hotel room and I did ask but no meals. It was caused by their own doing and they did not care. I will never take the risks to fly with Delta ever again."
"""he went above and beyond""","Bozeman to San Diego via Salt Lake City. Kudos to the agent at Bozeman for helping me with a lost ID issue. He went above and beyond in getting me checked-in, advising me on TSA procedures and trying to help me recover the ID by contacting the rental car company which opened only after boarding call. He even came aboard the flight to make sure I had gotten my seat and to advise me of his efforts. Also, the flight crews were excellent too. Friendly, helpful and never once acted like the customers were a bother."
"""travel with them again""","Managua to Los Angeles. Nice flight, would not recommend upgrading to business class. Not a full flight and the seats were not significantly larger. If on this flight from Managua to LAX likely won't be full due to odd time of flight (2:02AM). Delta currently flies from LAX to Managua once a week. Great crew and flying experience otherwise. Pilots were super nice as were the crew helpful. Would not hesitate to travel with them again."
"""extremely uncomfortable flight""","Vancouver to LAX was an extremely uncomfortable flight. Crew were great but from the moment the door shut temperature control in the cabin was all off. Almost immediately got way too hot to the point where it felt suffocating. Then people complained and it turned very very cold to the point where people were bundled in jackets, blankets, whatever they could find. This was in business class. Overheard a flyer in the main cabin mention it was extremely hot. Flight crew said its been an issue with the aircraft they just haven't been able to figure out yet. For a short flight (under 3 hours) it seemed way longer. Just wanted to get off the plane asap. Delta staff were great but this plane needs to be looked at. Also no in seat entertainment which made the time feel like it was dragging on more. Overall bad experience on this flight but excellent on others with Delta. If it weren't for the plane would have nothing bad to say about this airline."
"""an enjoyable experience""","Vancouver to Managua via LAX with Delta. Great flight, super easy and it felt reassuring to travel with a familiar airline to a new country for the first time. As a nervous flyer the cabin crew and pilots were amazing. Sat in 2D thus flight was worth the upgrade, no one sat next to me and the entertainment system was surprisingly updated with a great selection of movies. Meal was surprisingly good (vegetarian lasagna). Watched a movie and arrived in no time. Appreciative to the staff for making such an enjoyable experience."
"""a mixed bag""","A mixed bag overall with Delta Air Lines. Seattle - Atlanta, volunteered to be bumped to a later flight for a $500 voucher and a first class upgrade. Flight turned out to be a Boeing 767 with the international business class seats - very comfy with a good cheeseburger and Sam Adams beer for lunch plus a very friendly attentive crew. AVOD had a wide selection of films but was slow to respond and developed sound problems during the second film. Mad dash through ATL from Concourse F to concourse A to catch my connecting flight. Got stuck in the middle seat in Economy Comfort to Norfolk but OK flight. Coming back there was snow in ORF so we were delayed 30 minutes for deicing. Relieved we got out at all. Atlanta - Seattle was a new 737-900. Despite being offered a free Economy Comfort upgrade outbound for some reason I would have to pay $89 for the return trip. Why? During boarding an announcement went through all overhead bin space was taken despite the fact there was clearly plenty of space in the rear third of the plane. This led to a number of understandably irate customers who were forced to check their bags. The economy class seat was cramped and very uncomfortable and the indifferent, rather surly crew (most likely ex-Northwest) didn't help matters. About the only thing free on the AVOD was live TV and the games. Fortunately we arrived on time meaning and end to a punishing experience returning home. I much prefer traveling Alaska or Southwest but this one was for business."
"""a fantastic experience""","I had a fantastic experience with Delta Air Lines customer service today. When I deplaned in Atlanta I accidentally left my Kindle in the seat back pocket and didn't realize it until I boarded my next flight. I told an agent in ATL and gave her my information. 4 hours later when I landed, I had a phone call from an agent in TN saying they had my Kindle. A few minutes later they had my address and informed me it would be in the mail tomorrow! I was so impressed by their help and service!"
"""never fly on Delta again""","Atlanta to Raleigh Durham. My mother and I were returning home from visiting my critically ill sister and had a horrible experience with Delta. My mother is elderly and physically disabled. She had a hip replacement recently and needed a seat were the arm rest would lift up. I had my medical alert service dog with me also. They booked us in a seat that would accommodate my dog but not my mother so she was moved a few seats back. I was told I either had to sit with her or she would have to move back to the seat reserved (which they did in error to begin with). The seat I was reserved had more room for my dog. However I had to move - why I do not know. My service dog (which is a large dog) was made to sit in a area where she was unable to move a muscle the whole flight. Delta should be ashamed for the way they treat the disabled. We will never fly on Delta again."
"""openly criticising customers""","Detroit to Amsterdam with Delta Air Lines and the staff were appalling, openly criticising customers. Some were overweight and barged up and down the aisles bashing into everyone's arms and shoulders. Delta should consider keener and more friendly staff. The food was very poor. The one highlight was the Delta staff at Amsterdam. He was tremendous in sorting out an issue we had with an ESTA visa, and we were rebooked at no charge. If all their staff were like him, they would be some company."
"""all I got was I'm sorry""","My grandfather flew home from Orlando to Columbus and Delta Air Lines had promised he would be transferred from flight to flight along with his carry on. I told them repeatedly that he had dementia and they said that this was not a problem. They would make sure everything made it flight to flight. He arrived to Ohio and was greeted by aunt with no carry on! When I addressed them about the situation all I got was I'm sorry and that there was no carry on to be found! I had no issues with the flight to Florida, it was only the return flight! And no one will speak to you! It's all automated."
"""seat reasonably comfortable""","New York JFK-Bermuda-JFK with Delta Air Lines. Seat reasonably comfortable for a less than 2 hour international flight on packed plane. Experienced staff onboard very welcoming. Check in with ease and courtesy. Security check tedious and lengthy - over one hour at Terminal 4 at JFK due to high passenger volume. Drink service both ways with tiny snack, 2 small cookies or pretzels and soft drinks, coffee or tea. Pilots informative. Barely space for overhead luggage but allowed two unchecked hand luggage. Entire experience far superior to American or United (both dreadful) on this route and equal to Jet Blue (which has more legroom than any of the other 3 airlines which fly New York City-Bermuda). Delay in boarding in Bermuda upon return due to late arrival of aircraft but announcements precise and apologetic"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I booked $1600 first class seats with Delta Air Lines 6 months prior to my trip from Minneapolis to Fort Myers. This was my wedding so I wanted to have no issues. A month prior to my trip I noticed they had put me in different seats in a less desirable location. I contacted them and they explained to me that are not guaranteed. I flew to Florida in the seats I was forced to fly in. The night before we flew out of Florida I checked my flight to see if my flight was delayed. Once again I noticed my seats had changed for a second time but this time I was pushed from first class to coach and I was not sitting next to my wife and child. This was done without notice. I called Delta and explained the situation to them and they were very rude and said we got moved and there is nothing we can do besides switching flights. I have never ran into a airline that is more unorganized or disrespectful. For the amount of money spent to flight with this company I would highly recommend flying with someone else or pay a lot less for the same service."
"""friendly and hard working""","New York to Paris CDG with Delta Air Lines was a very pleasant flight. Staff were knowledgeable, friendly and hard working. Food was fine and enough. Drink was copiously in large cups. Compliment to the staff who asked regularly if we needed anything and nothing was too much to ask.!"
"""cabin crew were friendly""","Delta's B717-200s are probably my least favourite in its fleet. This type was used on my flight from Toronto to New York JFK. It really looked old inside and out. Boarding was on time and so was our arrival. The cabin crew were friendly and were smiling all the time. Snack was provided and it wasn't too bad. No IFE on this flight but it was okay. I enjoyed the view. I enjoyed the flight but it would have been better if a newer aircraft was used."
"""cabin crew were attentive""","Flying transatlantic is at least 7 hours so it is vital that you fly with a good airline. I was right to book Delta Air Lines on my way back to London Heathrow from New York JFK. I checked in using the Delta IOS app - very straightforward and efficient. Boarding was smooth and on time. The cabin crew were attentive and friendly. Other airlines must learn from Delta on this one. Most cabin crew from other airlines talk to you like a robot, mostly closed ended questions which is probably understandable when they are offering food for example. However, not all interactions must be of such nature. The food was great as well as the snacks. It did not look and taste horrible and cheap at all - a call out to Virgin Atlantic. It was a very comfortable and restful flight. I was impressed with Delta on their transatlantic products. I will definitely fly with them again."
"""what a stark contrast""","The Delta flight from Paris to Seattle on 20th January was one of the best flights I have had in a long time. The seats were comfortable, entertainment was great with lots of movie choices and meals offered were tasty and plenty. One main meal service and two snacks. Amazing cabin crew provided excellent service throughout the flight, with many drink service runs. The return flight from Detroit to Paris was most disappointing in comparison - with unfriendly crew, after meal service not seen again until an hour before landing in Paris. No drink runs and when I asked about the meal the reply was impatient and uncaring. It goes to show that the quality of the flight can vary according to the crew - what a stark contrast between the two flights!"
"""experience was really solid""","Four segments on Delta, one on KLM and one on Air France on a return trip from Ford Airport to Delhi. The Delta experience was really solid, from the friendliness of ground and onboard staff to cleanliness of planes. I am partial to the A330 because the 2-4-2 seating feels less cramped than the 9 or 10 across seating in newer widebody aircraft. Seats reasonable for economy, AVOD had nice foreign film choices and everything worked. Food was OK at best, probably the weakest part of the experience but not bad. Checking into a Delta flight at CDG was a little puzzling due to using Air France desks. SkyTeam does a great job overall, though, getting Delta passengers beyond Europe."
"""a good experience""","Early morning flight from Manila to Tokyo Narita on a 747 was something I did not expect. I last flew a 747 5 years ago, when CX used it quite a lot on the HKG-LHR route. I fell in love with the 747 again, thanks to the amazing Delta service. Their online check in was without frills, very straight forward. When I arrived at the airport in Manila, I was greeted by a battalion of Delta ground crew. They were all very helpful and attentive. One of them carried my bag to be weighed, whilst two of them assisted me with checking in on the self-service kiosks. I was only meant to check one bag (as it says on the ticket), but, they gave me the option to check my hand luggage, which turned out to be very convenient for me. We boarded on time. We were greeted by friendly cabin crew. I always select seats at the end of the plane because from a 3-4-3 configuration for example, the last 3-5 rows will only be 2-4-2. The flight was packed but the service was superb. What I really liked about this flight was the captain keeping us informed in a very transparent and friendly way, and not to mention the cabin crew keeping us comfortable, fed, and hydrated. The inflight entertainment was good. The food was good too. We arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This flight will probably the last flight I will have on a 747. Thank you Delta for making it a good experience."
"""would fly again""","Great service from Seattle to Kona with Delta. Enjoyed the complimentary entertainment options. Would fly again in a heartbeat. Staff went out of their way to be sure that our needs were met the entire flight. Restrooms were kept clean. My son was excited to watch our flight on their touch screen map."
"""most comfortable flight""","Minneapolis to Cancun. Seats were comfortable but I got scammed by paying extra for Delta+. We paid nearly $200 extra for a couple more inches of leg room. On the website it shows television monitors and the free entertainment package. There were no monitors and the only way to get free entertainment is to bring your own laptop or pad. I didn't have either thinking there were monitors, so I paid nearly $200 for a couple inches of more leg room. Even worse, on our flight back home there was a couple who asked to move to the seats we paid extra for and they let them move. The attendants were extraordinary, they really made us feel comfortable. I'll say this was one of the most comfortable flights I've taken, minus paying for something I couldn't use because of false advertising."
"""flight crew was gracious""","We were supposed to return from Asia on Saturday the 23rd through JFK, but the winter storm had other ideas, so after spending a couple of days in airports and getting rerouted, I ended up purchasing tickets from Delta Air Lines just to get home. By the time we got to MSP we were tired hungry and much less than happy. But our last leg helped tremendously. The plane was a newer A319, and the flight crew was gracious, helpful and funny. The flight was smooth and early, and the plane had a great AVOD in each seat which helped the flight go quickly."
"""the plane was loud and old""","I hadn't flown on a plane in almost 3 years, went on vacation to Mexico from Minneapolis with Delta Air Lines. The flight down was ok, service was good but the plane was loud and old. The flight back to the US we showed up at the airport 3 hrs early so we weren't late, we had the tickets booked 4 months in advance, we get our tickets and we were seated in row 33 - not having flown a lot we didn't think much of it. We waited in the airport for 2 hours, the plane was late, no big deal. We were patient. We finally go to board the plane and found that there was no window in aisle 33 on an A320. I don't get claustrophobic but on a plane when people would line up by the bathrooms commenting about how bad of a design it was, not to mention that you had to stand in the galley to wait for the bathrooms with 3 flight attendants trying to do their job was just the worst flying experience I have experienced."
"""comfortable seating in economy""","Web check in fast and easy with Delta Air Lines for New York to San Juan flight. Security at JFK a bit slow but fine. Boarding on time, by areas. FA very nice, not much interaction but correct service. Both flights to and from SJU on time, early arrival. Comfortable seating in economy, personal IFE, nice selection of movies for a 4hr flight. Drinks and sandwich free of charge."
"""poor customer service""","I've always flown Delta Air Lines and they have always been the best, until the east coast storm. They waited until the last minute to cancel flights into Richmond and it was too late to rebook as for two days all other flights were full. They booked us on a flight from Atlanta to Boston and then to Richmond - they said we could go to the airport on Sunday (the day before the new flight) and said we could standby on each flight going to Richmond along with 150 other people and this meant running from each terminal and gate to be on the list. One time I might be 40 on the list, the next 15 and not get out. I called Delta (because no one at any of the counters could help) and insisted on a new flight that day and got to seats out that night! It seems that they had seats available as didn't want to give them up at the airport, poor customer service."
"""it was a fiasco""","This was a rebooked flight after a cancelled flight due to the blizzard in NYC from New York JFK to Atlanta via Cancun. My issue is not that it was cancelled but how it was handled. The flight should have been cancelled in advance but it was not. I and the other passengers arrived and were told the flight was on. We boarded the deboarded due to the weather. Then we boarded again, and deboarded again. It was a fiasco. By the time we got off the plane, there was no way to leave the airport. I was stuck at JFK for 2 days and am now awaiting my overnight layover in Atlanta. Enquired about a voucher for a hotel or meals but was told they don't offer for weather related cancellations. I understand that as a theory but they should have cancelled that first flight. Then I would have stayed in a bed for 3 nights instead of on a chair in an airport with no food, change of clothes or shower. This experience has lost them a customer and I fly a lot."
"""aircraft was clean""","When I went to check in for this flight (which connected in New York with an Air France Flight to Paris) the Delta check in people in Rochester told me that they needed my visa information to check in. I didn't have a visa, as I am getting it while I am in Europe. This seems like an oversight on the airline's part, but the people managed to get me checked in with another system. While on the flight, we were informed that since it was a short flight, no drinks would be served in economy (which was annoying). Other than that the aircraft was clean and we arrived in New York on time. The wifi on the flight did not work well enough for me to use the Delta app or Delta Studio."
"""excelled at his job""","Maui to Los Angeles, and a first in almost 30 years of travel between Hawaii and the mainland was the working Wi-Fi. Pretty sure Delta is the only carrier offering this and only on certain aircraft. Cabin service was very good, although refurbished aircraft layout is odd with premium economy customers in the same cabin as first. What genius thought that was a good idea? Entertainment system was very good and food was pretty good. Seat pitch just barely ok for 6 hours. Lead flight attendant excelled at his job."
"""lack customer service""","Dubai to Atlanta, and Delta continues to lack customer service all around. Cleanliness of plane was not great, food was mediocre, flight attendants are not overly pleasant - rather more of a chore for them. Due to seniority the oldest attendants service the longer international flights, they really should change this model. 9 out of 10 times delta is late for me, gate agents are rude, more so in Atlanta (their hub) than other cities. Delta really needs to invest in customer service and understand the choices consumers have and where they can spend their money."
"""could be recommended""","The flight from La Guardia to Buffalo with Delta Air Lines was fast and cheap. Their ground services at the Delta terminal at New York LaGuardia are great, you could obtain free water, you could use their tablets and you are well informed. The flight itself could be recommended, the seats are very comfortable!"
"""it was awful service""","I was in Delta Air Lines first class from Minneapolis to Edmonton this afternoon, and it was awful service. The first class steward did the very minimum that he had to do. In a 2.5 hour flight he served us a drink with our lunch and we were not offered another thing in the remaining 1.5hours. Not even a glass of water! Also, once I had finished my lunch it was at least 1/2 hour before he picked up my tray. I was just going to use the call button because I needed to use the washroom. I saw another lady in 1C take the tray up to the work area herself. Not very impressed, On the short flight from Des Moines to Minneapolis it was the opposite, in that short 45 min flight even got a refill on my juice."
"""on aircraft right now""","Nashville to San Antonio with Delta, sitting on aircraft right now. Seats are awful. Once again, my carry on luggage had to be checked. We boarded at 7:20 am and it's 9:5am, and still sitting. The flight is delayed because of the bad weather, reasonable. I am starving, no drink or snack available. I was told that they would conveniently book me on Delta's next connecting flight which is at 5pm. I guess I am traveling for my looks or for Delta's convenience. I was scheduled to be in San Antonio at 1pm."
"""seats were awful""","Flew Delta because we wanted a late flight out of New York to Portland instead of Alaska, our preferred airline. Although I have Gold status on Alaska, Delta doesn't recognize it for bag check waiver or other benefits. Flight left JFK after we sat on the ground 2.5 hours waiting for de-ice, got in to PDX at 3am. Seats were awful, on a brand new plane, exit row with hard sides, which made them extremely narrow and uncomfortable. FA's were ok. Terminal 2 at JFK is awful, cramped, with old and few food choices - and the one good one was priced at what seemed like 2-3 times street prices."
"""did not offer anything""","I took this Delta Air Lines St Louis to Atlanta flight on 24 December 2015 to visit my family in Puerto Rico. My first stop was in Atlanta and we were supposed to land there at 8:30am. I was supposed to arrive at Puerto Rico at 2:12pm but we finished landing at 9:30pm. We were stocked in Huntsville, AL airport about 3.5inside the airplane. First because there was a thunderstorm in Atlanta, and that's totally comprehensible because it was for our safety, but then after 2 hours the airplane got a mechanical problem and when we finally were supposed to fly back to Atlanta, they kept us waiting for an additional 1.5 hours. At first they offered us water and snacks (first 30 minutes wait), but then we were there hungry, uncomfortable, without any Wi-Fi connection, and they did not offer us anything. Not a refund, not a meal, nothing. It was a very unpleasant experience and I understand that bad weather conditions is not Delta's fault, they do not have any control on it and they did everything to keep us safe that day. However, if they knew there was a mechanical problem in the airplane, I would expect at least that they change us to a different airplane or if it is a minor problem but they would keep us waiting for more time, have the consideration to offer us something in return for that wait, it could be a meal because that is a proper way to treat your clients, not keep them there in that condition inside the airplane for such a long time."
"""professional premium class crew""","I've frequently flown First and Business Class on American Airlines so I was keen to experience Delta's Premium product, flying from Salt Lake City to Paris CDG. Beginning with the boarding process, we boarded slightly late. Then with no notice they started boarding us. I was welcomed on board and made my way to the seat. The seat and private space was smaller than I am used to from flying with AA, but it is also a smaller aircraft. The seat offered a full recline, duvet and pillow. I found the seat fairly comfortable and although there was a massage function, it wasn't very effective. I also found there to be very little space to store anything small in the seat. Additional there was no call button for the crew. I was provided an amenity kit which was a very nice Tumi case. After settling in I was offered a drink. The TV display was smaller than I expected with an adequate range of entertainment. The aircraft was WIFI equipped. After take-off I was offered a hot-towel and had my drink order taken, then served a very nice dinner which I could chose from a menu. I found the cabin crew of a very high standard, they went above and beyond and made sure every request was taken care of quickly. This was probably one of the most professional premium class crew I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Unfortunately for breakfast they had run out of the choice I wanted even though the cabin was only 1/4 full. Nonetheless the crew made sure they did whatever they could. I was particularly impressed that I was offered a selection of teas."
"""solid 3 star performance""","Flew Delta Air Lines from Amsterdam to Seattle (A330), Seattle to Las Vegas (CR9) and Phoenix to Atlanta (Boeing 757-200). A solid 3 star performance. The flights were on time and clean planes. Edible food, but nothing to write home about. Coffee really bad - but than I think so of 95% of the coffee I get in the US, because I'm used to much stronger. Would use Delta again if price is right."
"""crew were pleasant enough""","Have flown Delta before and had problems, but this flight from Amsterdam to New York JFK was fine. Prompt service drinks not long after take off, good selection including spirits on the flight. Snacks served with drinks and then meal service after this. Another few drinks services, ice cream and a snack before landing. Crew were pleasant enough. Decent entertainment onboard with radio channels. On time flights and no delays."
"""customer service is a joke""","When I have flown with Delta in the past, the comfort of the actual flight was great. The customer service, however, is a nightmare. I booked a roundtrip flight, and then had to cancel because of scheduling. I cancelled my entire flight within 30 minutes of booking it. I called Delta to confirm I had cancelled and would receive a full refund. The service agent told me everything was confirmed and I would receive a full refund because it was within 24 hours. 8 days went by and I hadn't received a refund yet. I called Delta on 3 different days and was hung up on, transferred, put on hold, and hung up again on multiple times. The third day, I finally got a hold of a real person and told her my predicament. She said ""That did not occur. That confirmation number you gave me doesn't exist. You'll have to apply for a refund through the website and then it will be up to the auditor's discretion whether or not you receive a refund."" I said, ""But now it's been 8 days, so the auditor will refuse to refund me. I cancelled it within 24 hours - in fact, within one hour - and received confirmation that I did. Are you seriously telling me that whoever I spoke to 8 days ago was just making stuff up and now I'm just out $1200 for no reason?"" She was condescending and cruel, cutting me off. Her official response was that what I was saying never happened and there was nothing anyone could do. All I could do was apply for a refund and the rest was up to the auditor. If I had been able to reach a live person one of the other days I had called, or if the person I had spoken to that night had actually confirmed my cancellation, I would have $684.70 to pay other bills. $684.70 is way too much money for me to just lose. Delta's customer service is a joke."
"""we wait inside the airplane""","San José, Costa Rica to Los Ángeles with Delta Air Lines. Today we wait, inside the airplane for 3 hours, the delay was because, the Captain said, first for an electronic problem, and second because of the wind they had to pull out luggage for overweight. We lost the connection, and we lost one day of our vacation. Flight on Delta never again."
"""a lost customer""","Flight from Appleton delayed because of weather and arrived at 7:40pm at Detroit. Missed connecting flight that was to leave at 7:50 because they would not hold flight by 8 minutes since I had to get plane side checked baggage and transfer. Top it all off there was no more flights out that night and if I wanted to stay in a hotel they offered nothing to accommodate. Just another example of Delta's poor customer service and a lost customer for future flights."
"""my flight was delayed""","Expect delays. My last Delta Air Lines flight was no exception. On my flight from Greater Rochester into RDU, my flight was delayed due to weather. It took me half an hour to find a Delta rep to help me at La Guardia. Upon finally finding a rep, she was rude and unhelpful. I ended up leaving her presence in tears! I was exhausted, frustrated and stressed and all I wanted was a little assistance finding a place to stay in NYC. She just repeated ""Ain't my problem. I don't control the weather."" Over and over. This was a manager by the way. A TSA agent felt the need to apologize on her behalf! For something also out of my control - I had to eat the hotel charge. I paid more for the 2 hours I slept at the hotel than I did for my entire flight. But per Delta, not their problem. I fly with Delta twice a month. I have one more flight with them (already booked) and then my business goes elsewhere."
"""not worth paying additional""","I booked from New York to Zurich return with my wife and paid Comfort Class - as Delta advertise, better seats food, unlimited drinks and great entertainment for this. The true was only that the seats are more comfortable than regular economy class. Food was the same chicken and pasta, very small portion. Glass of wine and if you are lucky to get staff's attention later you might get another. Entertainment was mostly old movies with a very small monitor. Delta advertising is misleading and it not worth paying additional money for the Comfort class."
"""skymiles program a joke""","Delta's skymiles program is a joke. I am a silver medallion member and a skymiles representative recently told me that I had until Jan 31st to accrue MQMs and make Gold status. Just recently a different representative told me otherwise and said it ended in December. I purchased an expensive flight from ATL to DEN for Jan 29th (that would have been much cheaper through Southwest) so that I could obtain the status. Now Delta won't allow those miles to count towards my status and they wont provide a refund for my booked trip. I will be using all of my 250,000 miles for free trips and will ditch the AMEX Delta card along with Delta Airlines all together."
"""nothing that they could do""","We arrived at the Charlotte, NC airport around 7:45 am, giving us more than enough time to prepare and check in for our flight out at 9:45 am. To begin our day of misfortune, our flight was delayed due to weather purposes, which is understandable, till around 10:15 am. As we were flying out from Charlotte to our connecting flight in Detroit, we realized that we only had, what we thought, was a 38 minute layover to make it to our next flight out of Detroit. However, as we were leaving the terminal, we learned that the connecting flight was not delayed at all and we had approximately 3 minutes to make it to the gate before the flight began its departure. As I ran ahead and sprinted to the gate to try and save my family and I some grief, I was greeted by a Delta representative who proceeded to inform me that I was to late to get on the flight, even though I could physically see our plane sitting in the loading spot, motionless. So, my family, along with around 15 other people who experienced the same I convienemt timing and planning due to Delta, watched the flight we had payed for depart in front of us. To try to salvage this situation, the crowd of left behind passengers began to congregate to the airlines help kiosk, where we virtually on went to be told that we needed to call and contact a Delta representative about changing flights - even though there was a representative standing right in front of us. To make things even better, once we had finally jumped through enough hoops and made it onto our flight from Detroit to Las Vegas (6 hours later), we were surprised to find out that not only did any of our luggage make it to Las Vegas, but they were sent on a flight that departed 3 hours after we were scheduled to land. So, after speaking with a Delta baggage representative who realistically was no help, my family and probably 5-10 other passengers sat in the Las Vegas terminal for upwards to 3-3 1/2 hours before finally receiving our baggage. Not to mention that all of this was at the expense of us passengers, with the Delta representative claiming that ""there was nothing that they could do"". So thank you Delta airlines for your sincere and top notch service."
"""hassle free trip on Delta""","Honolulu to Los Angeles and a full red eye flight. The hard working crew were gracious and seats up front most comfortable. I passed on the meal so I could relax and enjoy the IFE. FAs helped a couple quiet their screaming infant who thankfully slept most of the way. Otherwise just a hassle free trip on Delta."
"""flights were outstanding""","Our family flew from LAX to BUF via ATL in first class and the service on both flights were outstanding. FA's were working and addressing passenger needs throughout the flight. The lunch served from LAX to ATL was delicious! The Delta app is easy and user friendly. You can even track your checked luggage while you travel. Delta's Glass Bottom feature is so cool. You can virtually see the cities and landmarks that you are passing over while you fly."
"""expect delays too""","Orlando to Geneva via New York JFK and Amsterdam. KLM / Air France partnering with Delta Air Lines is a joke. Delta has no respect on the travel details for international flights. If you fly Delta expect delays too. Coming to Orlando via Boston, our delay was roughly 11 hours! They only gave us biscuits and a drink. Flying back from Orlando to Amsterdam via New York JFK, I was ask to pay for a special luggage for 100$ which was included in my travel details from KLM. The funny thing is, they allow me fly with it coming to Orlando but they charge me leaving Orlando. Delta does not respect original ticket details from its partner airline."
"""recommend Delta Air Lines""","London to Montego Bay via Atlanta with Delta Air Lines, and it was extremely satisfying service from London to Atlanta. The female cabin crew were amazing on that flight. Inflight entertainment was of a great standard even though lack of music options. Food tastes good and the drinks were coming to me, my family and all the other passengers on a continuous basis. Great flight. Definitely recommend Delta Air Lines."
"""atrociously rude behaviour""","Portland to Orlando via Atlanta, and the worst service I have ever received from this airline. I usually fly first class, however I was flying with my 3 year old daughter and wanted to be able to lift the arm rest so we went premium economy. Supposedly, premium economy provides complimentary beverages. On a 4.5 hr flight I consumed 3 units of white wine and several club sodas. The flight attendant then informed me, and everyone within earshot that she ""did not feel comfortable serving me any more alcohol"". I have never experienced this in first class, or coach. When I called to complain about the lack of promised services and the atrociously rude behavior of the flight attendant, I received incredibly rude service and no compensation for the $50 a piece glasses of wine which is what I ended up paying. While my experiences with Delta have been good in the past, I am appalled at the way I was treated tonight and will not be flying Delta anytime soon. If you are trying to decide between first class and premium economy, realize that Delta treats their premium economy passengers worse than their coach passengers."
"""focus on consistent service""","Flew Delta from Green Bay via Atlanta to Salt Lake City on a skiing trip. Returned via Minneapolis. Three of the flights were delayed; the airline did send out updates to the smartphone. The worst delay was the last leg where the flight attendant did not show up for work! The pilot at the gate announced that the flight attendant's phone had been turned off and they were not able to reach the person. Finally, a substitute was found and we were able to complete our journey. Another irritating experience with this trip was that after every segment I received a survey questionnaire on my phone from Delta asking about the flight experience. Not the best time to ask - if only they would focus on consistent service and sticking to the schedule! At least our skis were delivered with us."
"""overall good value""","Paid for First per usual with Delta Air Line on my trip from Austin to Boston via Atlanta. Newer B737-900 to ATL. New seats, cabin was clean, IFE was very good via large screens in FC. Beverages only to ATL. Made trip to Term F. to experience the SKY Club there. Much better lounge with some decent food. Definitely worth the travel between terminals, if you have the time. International config B757 to Boston. Seats are okay, with lots of gadgets and somewhat narrow. I like the storage areas, as there are several and once again the IFE, on a very large screen was very good. A decent lunch, but still substandard in comparison to AA. Decent and professional flight attendants. All flights on time. First bag off. Not a bad trip at all. Overall good value and as I travel often I will travel again."
"""luggage left in Atlanta""","Orlando to Madison via Atlanta. On my connecting flight from Orlando to Atlanta they had a particularly full flight. Thus, they offered a complimentary service to check my luggage. My luggage was then left in Atlanta. Moreover, my time in Madison is limited and I would appreciate having clean clothes and medications while I'm here."
"""abandoned it's customers""","I vowed years ago to never fly Delta again but had no choice this holiday season as my daughter and I were returning from a cruise out of Miami. Unfortunately, Southwest did not fly into Miami and we were forced to fly Delta. On our return, we flew into Laguardia and waited to board our last flight to finally get home, when we were told there was a medical emergency on board and the plane would be late. As time went by the reason was quickly changed to bad weather so that the airline would not be responsible for any expenses they would have to pay out to their customers. Most of us were rerouted the next morning at 6:00am first bound for Atlanta, and then returning north to our final destination. I can't tell you how many passengers were left without a place to go, (they told us the terminal would be closed overnight,) and when we asked for food vouchers and water, we were all told that ""Delta no longer provides these things for their customers when flights are cancelled."" Had they not told their usual lies, many of us could have helped ourselves before it was too late. With a whole lot of angry people demanding answers, I would have hated to be the one behind the counter. We all asked to speak to the supervisor - she was of no help whatsoever. Some of us gathered people who lived in the same areas and made the decision to rent cars and trucks to get home as most weren't going to chance being marooned in another airport. We felt that Delta had abandoned it's customers."
"""lack of real information""","Syracuse to Boston via New Year JFK. Flight from SYR to JFK was on time and uneventful. The normal 55 minutes or so. Landed minutes before noon at Gate B45 and was delighted to find that my connection to Boston was going out from Gate B44. Delighted until the gate agent at arrival said there would be a delay due to ""no pilot"". From that point onward the departure kept changing later and later. The gate agent, though polite, had no information to offer. Kept repeating ""we're waiting for an incoming flight"". We knew that already. Since I also had an onward connection to Cape Cod at Logan, I was concerned that I might miss the last flight. The delay and lack of any real information was maddening. The gate people, to their credit, brought out snacks, water and soda. Finally had a plane arrive and had a lengthy boarding process with a lot of counting and re-counting passengers. Finally arrived in Boston at 5pm. A very long day and still not home. Why can't an airline simply tell their passengers what's going on?"
"""fly Delta as a last resort""","Missoula to Seattle. No seat assignment was able to be obtained at time of booking which was far in advance of our trip date. Flight was overbooked by three seats and seats weren't to be assigned until actual boarding time. They wouldn't begin boarding the flight until three passengers opted out but no departure time for a subsequent flight was ever announced. Our family was not able to sit together. The flight was one hour late arriving in Seattle and many passengers were either too late for their connecting flight or were very rushed to make their connections. No hot beverages were served. In the future we will only fly with Delta as a last resort."
"""was very impressed""","London to Cancun via Atlanta. Brilliant service from cabin crew and extras offered - good food on the long haul stint of the trip to Atlanta. For an economy ticket I was very impressed. Nothing was an issue for service staff on the airplane. I wasn't too sure what to expect, but made a great start to my holiday. My only improvement would be made to the ground staff in London Heathrow who were okay but miserable."
"""friendly and cheerful""","Delta Air Lines flight was on time, AMS-ATL, Boeing 747-400. Cabin crew were friendly, helpful, cheerful. Entertainment systems were very nice and had a big selection of movies. It was a pretty calm flight considering the flight was completely full but the flight attendants were quick and professional. Flight had delay of 1 hour, ATL-MEX, Boeing 737-700 but for a 3.5 hour flight it had an entertainment system at each seat, food was ok, flight attendants were friendly and cheerful."
"""FA's quick and efficient""","I usually fly business class, but on short hauls like this Tokyo Narita to Bangkok I can deal with economy. On the Delta Air Lines Boeing 767 you have seating of 2-3-2 in economy, so it is not bad with a companion. The plane is old, but was refurbished a few years ago so they have good AVOD. The food going and coming was actually good. The FA's were quick and efficient and even smiled. The economy seat gets hard on your lower back after 3 hours. Seat pitch was tolerable. Surprised that it all went well and was uneventful. Gogo in-flight wifi was not available. I do not think that the 767-300ER is a good one for business class. It looked really cramped."
"""main course was inedible""","Toronto to Shanghai via Detroit with Delta Air Lines. This review covers the flight from Detroit to Shanghai. Flight left three hours late. Not sure why, but had to move a plane from Atlanta. Not one announcement in the lounge of the delay. Crew handled themselves well. Service was spotty but the worst was the food served after we left Detroit. The main course was inedible and I felt badly for the folks who had to serve it. Apparently it was a new menu and lots of complaints. Maybe the economy meal was better. Won't be flying Delta overseas again."
"""no longer be my choice""","I flew Detroit to Nashville on business in February 2015. The flight was overbooked and I volunteered to give up my seat and take an electronic voucher. The voucher was good for one year. Due to personal issues, I was not able to use the voucher and wanted to book a flight for my son. The customer service rep tried to help me, but he needed permission from his supervisor to override the rule and book the flight for my son. The Supervisor denied my request. I waited on the phone for 44 minutes to be told the voucher will be useless. I certainly would not have wasted my time in an airport if I had known all of the rules attached to the voucher. I was doing Delta a favor by volunteering and obviously they are able to override this rule, or the customer service rep would not have tried. I am very dissapointed in an airline that was always my first choice when traveling for work. Delta will no longer be my choice of airlines."
"""terrible experience""","The first 3 legs of the trip to Colombia and back where first class (5 stars all the way). Then ẃe get on the plane to Seattle from Bogota. An old tired 757 with no in seat entertainment. Reminder we were flying first/business class. No mention that the 5 hour flight will have no in seat entertainment. No mention that you can bring your own device, just power it up cause there are no charging outlets. Ok, try connecting to the gogo service, which is 'powered by oracle' and for those of you more in the know Oracle is not exactly a 'streaming video' company. Ok, try to connect to the video service Nothing works, for anyone around as well. IPad, windows android devices all have the same issue. Contact support. 30 minutes later (and ample battery later) nothing works and I get a voucher for free internet (which doesn't include Netflix/amazon or any known video service). Terrible experience. Especially first/business class."
"""ignored seat assignments""","Paris CDG to Philadelphia. If you fly Delta Air Lines internationally just make sure you get an actual Delta Air Lines flight and not a KLM or Air France flight, since they ignored seat assignments made on the Delta Air Lines website. When you complain they just shrug their shoulders while Delta can't explain anything. Personally, I will never fly Delta internationally again."
"""thoughtful solution provided""","Our flight of 5 passengers including 1 infant and 2 young children from San Francisco to Toronto via Atlanta on Dec 28/15 was delayed by 3 hours which resulted in us missing our subsequent connection flight. Instead of letting us get on the delayed flight and letting the Atlanta staff deal with the connections which were all overbooked, the check-in counter staff put us at a hotel for the night and got us on a direct flight the following the morning. I have flown with 20+ airlines and traveled to 40+ countries. I am very impressed with Delta's courteous customer service and the thoughtful solution provided."
"""service was rushed""","TPA to AMS. I originally booked through ATL but weather there resulted in huge delays so we were rushed on a flight to DTW. This also ruined our plan to meet up with friends on the connecting flight from ATL to AMS. they were flying in from MIA. In Detroit I received message they were rerouted through JFK to be flying on KLM. I checked my aps and saw that flight to be wide open as well as a connecting flight from DTW to JFK. So in the main lounge of Delta I asked a ticketing agent if they could reroute us through JFK. I knew that since we were already involuntary rerouters, our ticket status would allow that. The agent said he could, then asked a supervisor who only saw trouble and problems, then said: sorry no seats on the flight to JFK. I just like to make a point that ticketing agents should not lie to customers. Delta's systems are so transparent that such lies wont hold. I did not persist but when I left the lounge for my flight to Amsterdam the JFK flight was boarding and the flatscreen said it had 20 open seats and that only 89 out of 117 had checked in which meant 48 open seats. On the flight to Amsterdam I was in row 6 - food orders were taking from the back and when it was my turn, I was only offered one out 3 food choices, the rest had finished. The food was terrible. When i mentioned it to a FA, I was told to contact Delta.com. Everything about the service was rushed and done in such a way it was convenient for the FA's : we took off at 4:15 pm. we were ordered to close blinds, then the lights were shut off. Dinner was rushed. Message: get to sleep. However when it was time for breakfast: no mercy: full lights on."
"""service was pretty good""","I went on Delta to Seattle via Denver. The service was pretty good, even though the plane itself was small. The refreshments onboard was good enough for a 2hr 30 min flight. The pliot flew the plane well and gave us a soft landing at Tacoma Airport. Overall, Delta Airlines is a great airline."
"""waiting for 3 hours now""","Portland to Mexico City with Delta Air Lines, and I have been waiting in the airport for 3 hours now. They keep saying that we will start boarding in 10 minutes but nothing happens. The last time I flew Delta we got delayed 10 hours and they did not give any reason why. I have had enough with the poor service and tardy arrivals."
"""never again with Delta""","Upon entering the plane, another passenger was seated in my seat. My husband suggested that he was in the wrong seat. The man immediately became verbally abusive to my husband and; I and I was scared because we were traveling with my daughter and a pet. The stewardesses instead of coming to our aid, we complaining that we were holding up people boarding. One flight attendant from the back of the plane came to our aid and said I should accompany her to the back of the plane while the situation was resolved. Meanwhile the man continued to harass my husband and daughter. Once people were seated, a flight attendant came to the area and tried to get the man to show his boarding pass. He continued to refuse this request. Eventually he showed his boarding pass but refused to move. I was told I would have to sit across the aisle. He continue to harass my husband during the flight. He threw trash in the aisle in my direction. He made cell phone calls during the flight. Nothing was done or said to him. He placed empty drink cups in the aisle saying he hoped the attendants tripped on them. At the end of the flight, he refused to stand up to let my husband & daughter out of their seats. We complained at the airport but were left as unimportant and not necessary to deal with. Nothing was done to ensure our connecting flight would be more pleasant. I will never reserve again with Delta. On our way to a different terminal I was instructed by a Delta pilot to put my pet back in her carrier. I was trying to give her some water. I did as he requested, but he continued to get in my face to tell me he was ""doing me a favor"" and I should be appreciative. After my experience on the plane, the last thing I wanted was a Delta employee telling me how ""helpful"" they were."
"""never again with these jokers""","Never again will I fly with these jokers! My flight on the morning of December 25 was canceled 12 hours prior to departure and I was rebooked on an 6 hour longer itinerary 40 hours later. The messages they sent did not even include the word ""sorry."" The customer ""service"" phone numbers on the email were unreachable from outside the US. When I finally found the hidden local number, the curt person at the other end informed me that they would do nothing for me: no hotel voucher or reimbursement, no upgrade, no free drink, no mile, no polite apology. I used to think that United was the worst airline on this route. I was wrong."
"""rethinking loyalty for 2016""","Delta just cancelled our flight today from New York JFK to Seattle, some 5 hours prior. They claim due to bad weather in other cities that have put their pilots over their time limit. Does Delta management have any clue in how to account for bad weather? Delta says they are not responsible for weather, but the bad weather is nor in our departure nor destination city. Delta says that our loss in hotel and prepaid activities are, in short, tough luck. Here is a platinum member that will be rethinking loyalty for 2016."
"""frustrated that it was Xmas""","Mechanical issues out of BHM on A320, but we were updated every few mins by cabin crew-which eased the tension as I only had a 42 minute connection in ATL. Just about made the connection. Overall not bad on the eastbound legs. Food outstanding out of ATL. Good service, a little stand off-ish, but generally good. Arrived LHR 40 mins early. No Line at fast track and bags already on carousel so overall a good experience. LHR-BHM wasn't quite so smooth. Food terrible & this is not an understatement. I had baked cod that was described as crispy, but in fact was chewy and slightly rancid, so I didn't eat it. As I usually find eating in a plane more of a diversion than anything else I was happy to pass on the food. My son chose basil tortellini but bizarrely came in a cream green curry sauce. Not sure what the were thinking when they came up with this menu. Not nearly as good as Eastboud USA origination. My wife had the oxtail that she said was really nice, so I guess my son and I just made poor choices. Service (apart from 1 FA) could only be described as frosty. Landed ATL 20 mins early. Security a breeze. Now the fun begins. I picked up a text from DL to inform me connection was delayed by 45 mins, no big deal here, but as it was last flight out on Xmas eve and seeing the lines for rebooking I was starting to get a bad feeling. Then the flight delayed another hour. The heart starts to pound a little more, then 15 mins before boarding and it gets cancelled. Was then given 2 options 9.55pm on Xmas day or 6.10, but couldn't accommodate all 3 of us so we would have to choose who was in which flight. Really! Delta sucks when it comes to these type of occurrences. Yes, the delay was weather related and was mostly out of their control, but to have no reasonable back up plan is poor. They had already cancelled one of the earlier ATL-BHM flights, so surely could have anticipated this a little better. In the end I managed to get a car from Avis and drive myself, so all was not lost. If I had taken Delta's option I'd no doubt be feeling a little like Tom Hanks in the 'traveller'! To be fair to Delta they did offer a hotel for the night. I think I'm more frustrated that it was Xmas, than anything else."
"""already there is an issue""","So our flight hasn't even taken off yet. And already there is an issue. We had upgraded to Delta comfort on our flight from New York JFK to Amsterdam, a long international flight. The biggest reason for this is there were only 2 seats in the row which was perfect for my fiancé and I. However, upon checking in - we find our row now has 3 seats - and I'm at the window. And she is in the aisle. With someone in between us. We called Delta and they apologized, but could do nothing about it. It's our first big international trip and either we are apart from each other the whole flight or someone is getting stuck in the middle. Neither of which is very appealing. We normally only fly American. I guess we should have stuck with what we know instead of taking a chance on Delta."
"""my airline of choice""","Inclement weather at my connection caused reroutes and significant delays, obviously very frustrating, but the Delta crews were professional and helpful throughout the ordeal - making sure we had drinks and snacks and even ordered pizzas for us when we were diverted to Huntsville to wait out the storm. Really pleased with the team members on each leg of my flight and in the terminals. They were so friendly and sincere despite the pushback they were likely getting from many passengers. Delta continues to make themselves my airline of choice. Thanks to the ATL and MSP based crews, appreciated you all today!"
"""never fly Delta again""","Our flight was repeatedly moved from gate to gate for 6 hours and then canceled without letting anyone know. They were too cowardly to announce that our flight was canceled overhead and just ignored the passengers till we figured it out. This all happened on Christmas eve! Hundreds of Delta passengers were stranded in an airport on Xmas eve and they gave us no answers and no apologies or vouchers were offered. The staff was incredibly callous and unsympathetic. They had 1 customer service rep to help over a hundred people in line. The situation was handled so badly. I've never been treated so poorly by an airline. I will never fly Delta again."
"""no definitive answers""","They boarded us on the plane, knowing that there was a mechanical issue on the flight, and made us wait an hour and a half, without updating us very frequently. At the end, they ended up de-planing us, made us walk back through customs and immigration, and then had a large line-up to re-book flights. When they booked us on a flight, they ended up delaying that flight without telling us, and then they tried to put us on another airline very last minute, made us walk all the way to the other end of the airport where the counter told us that flight had already left. So we had to come all the way back and they are trying to rebook us from scratch. Wasted an entire day at the airport and there are still no definitive answers. The service was friendly though."
"""never fly with Delta again","Seattle to Amsterdam, a 10 hour flight and my wife and I are not even sitting next to each other on Christmas Eve. Unacceptable Delta does not honor preferred seat request even if tickets are bought 4 months in advance. Very poor customer service. People at the desk are nice just doing there jobs. I will never fly with Delta again even if the long haul flight was free. Watch out for operated by. Sorry KLM and Air France, you guys lost my money as well."
"""value for money not given""","We a family of four flew Delta Air Lines from La Guardia, NYC to Fort Myers, Florida. Severe delay in flight. One seat was downgraded due to being oversold according to ticket. First class stated dinner but we were only provided water. Service was non existent. Value for money was not given. Would not recommend flying Delta."
"""she's drinking a Starbucks""","Little Rock to Atlanta. We've been diverted to a different airport without a Delta hub because the plane was not fully filled up with fuel so it couldn't be rerouted to an airport with a Delta hub. Why was the plane not fully fueled for a 6am flight knowing that weather was bad in ATL with was supposed to be a 1.5hr flight and now it has turned into sitting on a tarmac for 3 hours with no food, drinks, blankets, one bathroom and having the air freezing inside. Unprofessional flight attendants while explaining the safety instructions was getting into her carry on to get gum instead of instruct. Then when she is walking through to make sure everyone is buckled up before we take off she's drinking a Starbucks! Unprofessional!"
"""embarrassed by his attitude""","After a 5 day holiday in New York my son daughter and I boarded the flight home and was seated in the back three seats of the aircraft, the air conditioning was on quite high so had to cover our legs with our coats as it was quite cold, this carried on throughout take off and till we were well into the air which was a good half an hour. When the steward came round to give us peanuts and biscuits I asked him if he could turn the aircon down - he told me to cover my legs with a blanket - as I'd already done this and was still cold I asked if he could turn the aircon down as I'm cold. He said I don't agree with you, it's a good temperature and if I turn it down the other passengers will be too warm. He was so dismissive of my request and abrupt that I was embarrassed by his attitude. My flight home was an unpleasant experience as he was passing me for the whole flight (I fell asleep and missed breakfast so had to ask him for one, he went and got me one then threw it on my table) to be treated like that on what should be a pleasant experience was unacceptable. The three people in front off us was also cold trying to get warm all the time, one of them wearing a hat and the others huddling under blankets to keep warm."
"""an enjoyable flight""","Our trip to Brussels started out in Austin, Texas with a short two hour flight to Atlanta, as per usual when flying transatlantic with Delta, you are usually directed through Atlanta, New York, or Detroit. The domestic first class seats were comfortable enough, and there was a charging port between the seats as well, however there was no inflight entertainment. We were offered snacks like peanuts, potato chips, and crackers out of a basket, and all drinks were free. However, because of the short length of the flight there was no meal service, and even some of the larger snacks like tapas were unavailable. The flight attendants were polite and nice, but they were not above and beyond, and didn't interact with the passengers more than they had to. As we were flying in the Delta One cabin international, we got free access to the Sky Club, however with so many people flying for the holidays, it was overly crowded, and a restaurant by our boarding gate was a much better option to spend our two hour layover. When the flight from Atlanta to Brussels finally boarded, we were promptly offered champagne or orange juice. There was a Westin pillow and comforter set, TUMI amenities kit with a pen, lip balm and lotion, eye mask, socks, tissues, mouthwash, and earplugs. After passengers were seated, attendants brought cashews and refilled our champagne. About an hour after take off dinner service included option of beef or cod. The inflight entertainment was rather limited with about 30 or so movies and a handful of television shows on seatback screens. The staff was friendly, but didn't quite go out of their way to do anything. When we arrived in Brussels, after a quick mix up at passport control, we were on our way after an enjoyable flight in relative comfort."
"""no need to be surly""","Saint Martin to New York JFK. We should have know from the start of this flight with the mayhem at the airport that this was not going to be good. We finally boarded and then had to wait on the tarmac for an hour due to heavy air traffic. The Captain kept us up to date, but still we were an hour late. There was one FA in Business and three in Economy. They announced that the beverage service would begin shortly and that passengers in Business and Delta Comfort were entitled to complimentary drinks, which was one of the reasons I booked DC in addition to the additional legroom. The beverage service started and we were in the second row of the Comfort seats. Everyone around me ordered soda, coffee, water but no one order an alcoholic drink even though it was late afternoon. When the surly flight attendant got to me I asked for a double gin and tonic. Without smiling she asked if I wanted the whole can. I figured it would save her time so I said yes. She couldn't find tonic in her drawer, harrumphed and walked back to get one. Upon returning she asked if I wanted one cup or two. I told her one would be fine. As she opened the first of the two gin bottles she looked at me and said, ""I'll give you these two but that's all you're going to get."" (She wasn't kidding.) I was dumbfounded. I didn't have any intention of ordering more, but I didn't need her to ensure I knew I wouldn't be getting any more - regardless of the fact that I was in a seat entitled to ""complimentary drinks"" (no mention of a limit). She pushed her cart to the next row and moved on. Later in the flight I wanted some water and got up and went to the rear galley, where the three FA's were enjoying one of the cheese and cracker snack boxes. They were talking and I didn't want to interrupt, but waited until one of them noticed me standing in the doorway. After several minutes one of them did and asked, ""What can I get you?"" ""A bottle of water please."" Her terse reply, ""We don't have bottled water,"" to which I replied, ""Fine then. A cup of water please."" She turned around, tossed the cup on top of the bin of ice on the cart, sloshed some water in the cup and handed it to me, never asking if I wanted ice (the water was room temp). I returned to my seat, looked at my husband and said Delta sucks. I understand if FA's are miserable when dealing with nasty passengers, but when the passenger is being polite there is no need to be surly and curt. Just one more example of how much US airlines have to learn."
"""seats in different rows""","Dayton to Albuquerque via Atlanta. Customer service in Dayton was ok but Atlanta, as usual, was awful. Delta apparently does not allow you to purchase tickets and to pick a seat at that time . For us, this resulted in my husband and I being assigned seats in different rows. When I asked to be allowed to sit next to my spouse then I was given seats at the back of the plane."
"""food was delicious""","Amsterdam to Tampa via Atlanta with Delta. I never thought I would write this about any airline but the food from Amsterdam to Atlanta was delicious. I had a couscous salad with chicken and it was great. The cabin crew was also nice and helpful. I'm very satisfied with Delta and look forward flying with them again."
"""way to rip people off""","We paid 150$ extra to fly my grandson from Traverse City to Detroit. After he entered the plane, no one talked to him or directed him when he arrived. He wandered around the airport till I found him. Why did I have to pay the extra money beside the seat cost for a baby sitter? Any way to rip people off."
"""could do better""","My first flight was delayed, so we were told we needed to rebook so we would not miss the connecting flight. As we got into line with three people ahead of us, two off the four customer service agents went on break leaving two agents with six available terminals. After waiting in line for an hour, another agent went on break, leaving one agent. When she was finished with her customer, a sky priority customer jumped ahead to her station, and she helped him, even though there were four sky priority agents working. Then another customer, from nowhere cut the entire line, and she let her do this. No back up - yet only one agent. Finally, 2 agents came back from break, and lucky us our agent could only get us on a flight 10 hours later, we were offered no comps, and no upgrades. I was crying when I told our agent that I would be charged an extra 100 dollars by our rental car company, which I don't have the money for, and he just said sorry. Not to mention the increased rate we paid for a non-red eye (I don't sleep on flights.) On the red eyes we were given seats that do not recline , making it impossible to get some shut eye. Delta, you could do better! Please have more staffing around the holidays and management of breaks."
"""customer service very kind""","New Orleans to Toronto via Atlanta. As I was checking into my flight I noticed that my flight had changed and I was arriving about 90 minutes after I was initially meant to. I was flying home for the holidays and really wanted to be home as early as possible. I called Delta and the customer service woman was very kind and changed my flight for no extra charge (despite the change in flight times being slightly less than 90 minutes as is their policy) and I arrived home almost 2 hours earlier than I was originally supposed to!"
"""request seats when booking""","Amsterdam to Newark. After having flown with Delta before we booked again this year, however the seats going to New York were poor. Although we checked in online the day before, we were not given a choice of seats and on arrival at the airport were allocated seats, right at the back of the plane near the toilets! During a long haul flight the queues for the toilet were constant and a disturbance, also being the last seats on the plane our choice of food was non existent as we had to have what was left. I contacted customer service at Delta from New York as I did not want the return flight to be as bad. I was informed that I should or could have chosen my seats when I booked online to begin with and this was on the website, which I have to confess I had not seen or noticed (but I will look out for it next time I book). I explained I was not happy and was offered seats further down the plane at a cost of $40.00 each (total of $160.00), I told the lady in customer services that I was unhappy that I had to pay an extra $160.00 for something I could have had for free and she very kindly spoke to her supervisor and waived the costs which was very good of Delta. I really want to point out to people as I had not noticed it that you can request seats as when booking to begin with which is quite obviously what most people are doing."
"""lying or simply incompetent""","Honolulu to Phoenix via Los Angeles. We had to check a bag because a jar of jelly was too big. They called it late check-in and charged us $35. When the bag didn't arrive in Phoenix, they promised to deliver it. I arranged my schedule to be at home to pick it up. They called today to tell me to come get it because it was late check baggage. I am so angry! My husband has the car, plus it is at 1:30 hour round trip. They didn't say a word about a different policy because it was late check in. We should have just thrown out the jelly, but that would be expecting us to know their policies. I do not know whether the person who took the report was lying to me or simply incompetent. The seats were horribly uncomfortable on both parts of the trip. They want you to put carry-on items under the seats, but the seats are so close that it is very difficult to get them out again. The aisles are so narrow that even really skinny people hit other travelers when they walk down the aisles. The final part of our trip was delayed because the previous flight was late getting there. One of the flight crew kept trying to speed up the boarding process. He yelled at people not to block the aisles, and to let others around them. That seems like fine advice, but it seems he didn't notice that a lot of the people didn't speak English. Instructions spoken in English, no matter how loud, are not helpful when the person doesn't speak English."
"""downgrade a paid customer""","Downgraded from paid first class. I booked a paid first class seat for myself and then a day before my trip my son decided he wanted to come with me, so I paid for him to travel along side. I spent 30 mins on phone to Delta arranging his ticket, was given a seat assignment etc etc. The next day when checking in my son had a seat request boarding pass, so checked in with gate agent and was given 12A for my son and 1D for me. I told them he had been assigned a seat next to me in row 1. They checked computer etc and said that was impossible as the PAX in that seat had purchased in October. I asked if that PAX had been awarded an upgrade and if so as I had a paid 1st class would they be able to downgrade a non paid 1st class. I was then told they couldn't do that. So as the plane is boarding I call their prem Skymiles number and explained. I was told by them that they never oversell in 1st class and should have downgraded someone, probably even had a couple of non-revs in that cabin. As it was a short flight I ended up downgrading myself also as my son is only 8. Eventually I got a decent credit with Delta, but was pretty mad about their process as it simply makes no sense to downgrade a paid customer and enforce a 2nd paid customer to also downgrade themselves."
"""passengers were left in the dark""","I had a terrible experience with Delta Air Lines flying from Seattle to Boise. The customer service and information technology could use a complete overhaul. The flight was two hours delayed for two separate reasons. Firstly, the airline allowed a passenger that was not on the flight onto the flight and did not notice until we were about to take off. Secondly, in this process the plane ran out of gas. The crew were very poor at addressing these problems and the passengers were left in the dark through out most of this delay. I will never fly this airline again."
"""seat pretty comfortable""","Flew Delta Air Lines in First AUS-ATL-BOS. Flight to ATL on a newer B737-900 with Sky Interior. Nice Seats, a little less legroom, as Delta's domestic FC only has 37"" of pitch. Seat pretty comfortable, inflight entertainment is really good, on demand. No food service as this flight is 86 miles short of qualifying for breakfast, just drinks. Flight attendants were fine, yet hardly seen as once again, no real service. Hiked it to Terminal F to experience the Delta Sky Club there. This is a much better club, with some pretty good food offerings. ATL-BOS leg on a Intl configured B757, seat looks nice, is somewhat narrow, seat does not offer a full leg rest unless you recline into the full bed position., so a decent seat with a short leg rest, in the seated position. Lunch was a Turkey Pastrami sandwich, with bagged chips and a store bought wrapped cookie. Come on Delta, this is First Class, which, I pay for, as always, not an FF upgrade, prepackaged food for lunch. The food service is where Delta fails in comparison to American, my other preferred carrier. Delta's food tastes fine, yet presentation is totally lacking. I’m Elite with Delta, American and Virgin America, Delta’s gate employees tend to be very nice, but on board offering are not up to par."
"""not want to fly again""","My husband and I had a direct Delta Air Lines flight from Honolulu to Seattle that left around 10:30 pm with a total flight time of five hours and twenty-five minutes. It was extremely hot (coming from a person who is cold most of the time) when we boarded the aircraft and remained that way the entire flight, which made it uncomfortable. We were offered a beverage and snack not very long after we departed with the next beverage offering not until 45 minutes before we landed. Between the hot temperature and not being offered enough water, or some type of beverage, I was dehydrated. The experience was enough for me to not want to fly on Delta ever again."
"""good flight overall""","Mexico City to Nashville via Atlanta with Delta Air Lines. It was a good flight overall. In the four flights we arrived before the schedule time and that´s always good, but I was unconfortable with the space between seats, there´s not enough space to enjoy the time inthere. Also, some of the flight attendants weren´t as polite as the should be."
"""really awful service""","San Francisco to Calgary via Seattle. Really awful service from start to finish. I booked my flight through Westjet so Delta is refusing to do anything about it despite the lady at the help desk saying they would. Agent gave me boarding pass to different flight without telling me mine had been cancelled. This flight was delayed and we were not communicated with whatsoever causing many of us to miss our connections. Staff were stressed and rude. Told us we could try running. Connection left 3 minutes before departure even though there were five of us running to get there. New flight landed at midnight meaning either sleep in the airport or try to get picked up then which was not possible for many of us. Refused to get us hotel since we couldn't get picked up. Told us to complain and we would receive some kind of compensation which is now not happening either. Absolutely nothing was done to help us out during the experience. We were never communicated with and had to ask repeatedly to find out what was going on. I was promised they'd fix it and they refuse to do anything to make up for it."
"""anything but first class""","My recent experience in first class on a Delta flight from Minneapolis to Salt Lake City (round trip) was anything but first class. The seats in the first class cabin are spaced so close that the tray tables cannot be put in place if the passenger in front of you has reclined his/her seat. This was true of any first class passenger faced with the situation. The flight attendant offered lamely that she wondered why this was a problem saying: ""That's strange."" Well, it's not strange, Delta has crowded more seats into first class than the seats are designed to permit. It was VERY difficult to get seated in so little foot room as there was. I would only subscribe to Delta first class for routing purposes and would not recommend its first class to anyone."
"""better than expected""","Delta Air Lines business class from London LHR to New York JFK. Smooth checkin at T3 - I could not checkin on line, as if you are not an US Citizen or travel with Visa Waiver, but have a visa, you cannot checkin online - ridiculous. Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse was amazing and a pleasure to use. Boeing 767-400 has 1-2-1 configuration in Business Class, but seat is quite hard and very narrow, especially when reclined - it is hard to move when you sleep. Cabin crew was quite young and very friendly. Boiling hot hot towels (some passengers drop them on the floor, as it was hard to hold it). Surprisingly good food, average wine list (I'd expect more American wines), but Delta Sunrise Signature Cocktail was a hit. Excellent dessert cart. Very disappointing IFE - no blockbuster hits, just a few new movies, TV shows I've never heard of - simply, there was nothing to watch. Because of some turbulence there was no second service. Arrived on time. Generally, decent product, better than expected, very nice crew, but nothing special to remember except signature cocktail which was a hit."
"""terrible system with no value""","Flight was fine, but this is about the most miserable experience with Delta customer service in setting up / resetting an account. Needs the home address, account gets locked for 24 hours, cannot add miles with confirmation number [need ticket number], associates contacted by email do not read the emails and/or do not have access to the correct systems to help. Entirely too much work for like $27 worth of miles (4000 of a 60000(?) free ticket worth $400 or so). Ridiculously inefficient and terrible system with no value."
"""staff were friendly throughout""","Flew Delta Air Lines from SAN-PHL with a layover in SLC and PHL-SAN with layover in AL. Gate agents were nice and got us onboard quickly, all flights were on time. Didn't purchase food on the plane, but drinks and snacks were given. Entertainment was only on longer flights but was good. My one complaint is that the TVs didn't have ABC which caused me to miss the Michigan-Ohio State game. I think thats an issue with ABC, because United and Jet Blue which use Directv also don't have ABC. (Delta uses Dish Network.) Staff were friendly throughout and seats were ok comfort wise."
"""A pleasant surprise""","Living in Miami I fly the dreaded American Airlines 95% of the time, but thanks to their unusually high fares this year, and a spate of bad experiences, I switched to Delta for this trip. Unlike AA, I have zero ""privileges"" / status on DL, but even with that the flights were far better than what I have become accustomed to. Boarding on the two outbound and the two return segments went smoothly. Ground staff, and cabin staff were friendly, smiling, and even uttered words like ""please"" and ""thank you,"" which the AA employees forgot sometime back in the 1990s. Their uniforms were neat, clean and pressed. The boarding process, even in ""Zone 2,"" was organized and efficient, again in contrast to the priority boarding / rugby scrum I usually encounter at AA gates in Miami. DL pulls off boarding, somehow, with only one agent, which probably cuts labor costs and frees up more money for amenities like charging stations all over their Atlanta terminals. IS DL up to European or Asian standards? Probably not. But for the money, and a domestic US trip, this was a good value. I'll consider switching again in the future. A pleasant surprise!"
"""Flight was delayed""","Flight from San Diego to San Jose was delayed only 15 minutes then given no notification by anyone until 15 minutes before our flight that it was delayed. No explanation, no help, no offer of a refund or trying to find us another flight. My husband and I can't miss our jobs early the next day. Customer service is absolutely horrendous at both bag check in and ticket counter. Will never fly Delta Air Lines again."
"""would never fly Delta again""","I'm not a kind of traveler that ever complains or ever taken a survey to evaluate the quality of service. Today however is different. I've been pushed to the limit and will make a note, of the terrible service that I've received on Delta. I'm on flight AF9301 seat 41H from Minneapolis to Paris CDG. Flight attendant takes the poor Delta service to a new low. First, she is ramming her food cart onto seats and passengers shoulders and proceeds with no remorse or even a simple excuse me. Just passed with a drinks cart, looks like she looks at faces, and chooses who she will ask if they need a drink or not. She clearly ignored me as I awaited to get a drink, and I must say, I have never felt disrespected this much. I had to politely ask another attendant if drinks were for purchase or complementary, just to calm my head. Across the isle, an elderly woman who clearly doesn't speak English motioned for service, unable to clearly get the message across, the woman pointed towards the snacks on the cart the FA was pushing, then the FA grabbed a bunch of snack peanut packets, and literally threw them at the elderly woman. When I asked why the attendants seemed so disrespectful, a senior attendant mentioned something along the lines of staffing etc, which I personally, thought was an excuse, as the aircraft seemed to be less than half full. If had a choice, I would never fly Delta again. Unfortunately Delta is too big an airline, that my choices are narrowed and I keep finding myself on Delta flights."
"""very impressed and so grateful""","Orlando to Rochester via Atlanta with Delta Air Lines. I had been visiting family in Florida when I had to go into the hospital for emergency surgery. Upon release we flew home. Every step of the way Delta employees went out of their way to make the trip as easy as possible. They were efficient and friendly, and made what could have been a painful trip totally smooth. Wheelchairs were waiting at every point; the flight attendants were caring and attentive, and our luggage was checked as a courtesy and was waiting for us when we arrived at baggage claim. We are very impressed and so grateful."
"""didn't expect anything this bad""","Heard lots of bad things from others regarding Delta but really didn't expect anything this bad - asked to be seated as near to a toilet as possible as my girlfriend is registered disabled, and told we were 4 rows away. It appears this toilet is for business class only and my girlfriend was not only challenged by a horrible air steward but a middle aged passenger who took it upon himself to block the aisle and become obnoxious to her - I made my feelings pretty clear to him as you can imagine. In general the staff were unhelpful and just not interested, the complete opposite from the Virgin crew we had on the outward journey. The food was not good plus the inflight entertainment system was not working properly. I would not travel with Delta again if my life depended in it."
"""Unprofessional and unreliable""","Delta cancelled Flight 0135 from Amsterdam to Detroit on November 19, 2015 because the Delta crew did not show up to fly the plane. It was a full flight with many passengers having already flown for some 8 hours already internationally to Amsterdam. The baggage and food was loaded onto the flight, the KLM representatives were at the gate to board everyone, and then we were told the crew simply did not show up to fly the plane. Later the flight was cancelled - without any announcement or posting on the electronic boards, and hundreds of passengers had to stand about 7 hours in line to get rebooked!! People were exhausted. Many had other horror stories about past experiences with Delta that some said cancelled flights for no reason at all or because they can. Unprofessional and unreliable. Avoid if you can. Too bad KLM is partnering with Delta now."
"""not enjoyable as the past""","We flew on DL1112 from Atlanta, GA to Phoenix, AZ. On our first attempt our plane had to be taxi back due to a malfunction in the cockpit. We completely understand about malfunctions and the crew was able to get everyone on the flight on another plane within an hour. My biggest complaint was the fact that once we boarded our second plane we had to wait an additional hour bc we were waiting for the catering cart to arrive. My recommendation would be to wait until the plane is ready to go before boarding passengers. There was a few passengers that we're getting impatient and one passenger even had an outburst saying ""who cares about the food, let's just go. Let's Go!"" Our seats were bad this time but no fault to Delta we just had kids behind us both flights and the first flight a kid pulled my wife's hair and on the second flight a kid and their parents kept bumping our seats. Normally we have very good experiences with Delta airlines and I would recommend them over some other airlines. Just having the stress of this being Thanksgiving weekend our experience was not enjoyable as it has been in the past."
"""Delta did its job""","Flew Delta in First from AUS to SAN, via SLC roundtrip. I’M Silver with Delta, Platinum with AA and Gold with Virgin. Delta ranks third for their First Class offering. Seat pitch is the tightest at 37”, the food options on flights under 900 miles is a snack basket. As a Sky Club member, in addition to Admirals Club membership, we used both. I feel Delta’s Clubs are minimalistic in comparison. The bars are small and the food offering are somewhat amateurish. Don’t get me wrong. Boarding was orderly and we did not have to wait due to Priority. The planes were clean, the seat cushion is comfortable. All our flights left on time and arrived on time. Breakfast served to SLC, a plate with a Bagel Breakfast Sandwich on it, a side dish with some fruit. The Quality and taste were fine, the meal just looked un substantial compared to my other proffered carriers. The flight attendant to SLC was pleasant, did his job quickly and sat and read for the remainder of the flight. The Flight to SAN had a very proactive flight crew, constantly in the aisle, refilling drinks and constantly passing the snack basket, with some decent offerings. The return flight to SLC offered again the snack basket and some wine. A somewhat cold, but very professional attendant served us on this leg. She performed her job very well. The last flight to Austin offered dinner. After my earlier in the week breakfast flight, I was not expecting much. I was surprised to be offered a perfectly cooked Fillet, with sides and a dinner roll. Desert sadly was a pre packed brownie (Really, Prepackaged in First). All in all Delta did its job, we were spot on time and our bags came out fairly quickly. The food offering are spares in compared to other, but what was offered was of decent quality. We fly a lot, hence the Elite status with (3) carriers. Delta, while still good, ii is still my 3rd choice. The inflight GoGo Entertainment failed completely on all four legs. We were glad we did not have to pay for it."
"""never flying Delta again""","Four years ago I made a rule that I would never do Delta flights again. In the the past with every Delta flight they have lost my luggage, delayed me hours, and made me pay for another ticket for getting stuck in a snow storm. In desperation to get home this year, the cheapest I could find was Delta. I took a risk and lost. I am now delayed 3 hours because they can't get their act together! New rule : never flying Delta again, no matter how cheap."
"""children to sit separately from me""","I booked my Delta Air Lines flight in July for myself and my three children. I was just informed that it wasn't possible to book our seats together. Why in the world would I want my three young children to sit separately from me next to people I don't know. When I booked for one adult and three children it should be clear that they will need to sit by their parent. My gosh! One son is slated about 20 rows ahead of the remaining three of us."
"""most unorganized flight""","Atlanta to Newark. I usuallly do not have any complaints about Delta. However, our flight from ATL to EWR was delayed due to weather. Fine. Then we had to wait for the flight attendants to arrive before we could even board. So instead of boarding at 9:41pm we had to wait even longer before we could even board. It is ridiculous that we were unaware of when we would arrive to our destination. Many people had children and it's insane that we will be arriving past midnight. The most unorganized flight I've been on. I won't be going to Delta anytime soon."
"""I have received no response""","We have flown Delta on numerous occasions as we have a house and business in US. Our honest opinion is that in general we use Delta because we prefer to fly from our local airport, and this is a service supplied in conjunction with Air France and KLM via Paris / Amsterdam. Overall, the service is poor. We have found cabin staff mostly friendly and helpful, though not always. Food is usually ok but I am afraid that on numerous flights pre booked months in advance, my family are seated in different parts of the plane, most unacceptable particularly dissappointing when you have booked a family holiday months in advance. When challenging them about this we get nowhere. The last flight we checked in online and received a telephone call to say all was ok but when we were checking our luggage in on the return journey we were told at check in 'oh this flight goes tomorrow evening'! Now after much arguing and apologies we were put on a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt but 35 hours door to door from US to UK is totally unacceptable. This experience on numerous occasions has made us reconsider. The flight experience is far too much hassle for a family and I have to say I am relieved we do not have to endure this ever again. I have complained to the airline on a number of occasions but as yet I have received no response. In my opinion Delta are a letdown to the whole ethos of customer service and care in the US and I will certainly not contemplate using their services again."
"""airport experience very nice""","Tokyo Narita to Singapore, and the Narita airport experience is very nice. Ground staff friendly and helpful. While waiting for boarding Delta has an area for economy class passengers in Narita Airport. I've found it very relaxing and comfortable because they do have a reclining chair which where you could take a nap (but just be mindful of your boarding time). Boarding was smooth, and onboard the flight attendants are very nice, especially the Japanese crews. The only regret on my experience is that the IFE is poor - they have limited movies to watch. Also, the blankets aren't really comfortable. But the meals are okay, and waiting for the baggage was quick on arrival."
"""random act of kindness""","My daughter and I checked in online and were set to use our phones as our boarding passes. My daughter, for some reason didn't receive her text message. As we were discussing this, the curbside baggage check attendant, overheard us and told us not to worry, he's got us covered. Once he took our bags, he produced both of our boarding passes printed out. Since my phone died shortly after that, it really came in handy! Thank you so much for your outgoing, random act of thoughtful kindness! The Wifi was another issue - I paid for it, but never was able to get on."
"""attendants very polite and efficient""","Delta Air Lines from Atlanta to Jacksonville. Flights in and outbound same day, DL 1258 and 1616. Both were MD-90's. The flights were fast. In the first case, I landed earlier than the scheduled landing time. On return, while we had to wait about 20 minutes to take off (for whatever reason), we still landed early. The only downside on the outbound flight was that the flight was so quick that beverage service couldn't be completed. Both flights were completely filled. However, by getting to the airport early for the return flight, I was able to get moved from a center seat to a window seat further up in coach class. The flight attendants were very polite and efficient."
"""horrible customer service""","Honolulu to Salt Lake City via Seattle. Delta changed my flight at the last minute and put my wife towards the back of the plane with me and my two children under 4 years old near the front. We called and asked if they could put us together so we could help each other keep the kids calm, since we had bought tickets with four seats right next to each other. They were very rude and basically said deal with it. Delta Air Lines have horrible customer service and could care less about anyone on the plane since everyone had to deal with my kids crying for their mother or their father when we switched seats."
"""missed my connection flight""","Tuesday morning I departed from HOU to travel home (STL) for a family emergency. I understand delays due to weather but my flight from STL to ATL did not depart on time. The flight staff did not inform us of any difficulties therefore I do not feel my time was being valued. I arrive in ATL later than scheduled and the airline did not feel the need to give them notice that I was on the flight and that I had a connecting flight and unfortunately missed my connection flight home. Due to this, I was unable to make it to work Wednesday night and accumulated another days' expenses from on site parking, Delta only felt the need to give me a limited $50 gift card."
"""Thank you Delta""","New York JFK to Amsterdam with Delta Air Lines. A medical emergency forced me to return to Hamburg earlier than booked. Delta was very supportive and changed my flight at no extra charge and without asking any unnecessary questions. Their service on the ground and in the air was excellent. Wheelchair assist worked well. Thank you Delta."
"""helpful and smart service ""","Every airline has its bad days, but I have been very happy with the service on Delta Air Lines. I recently made an error in my booking and the agent on the phone fixed it immediately. Then it turns out the agent had double-booked me on the flight so I called again. I am still waiting for the refund to my credit card but thanks to their helpful and smart service reps, I feel fairly confident they will figure it out. Traveling is so stressful these days that good customer service on airlines means more to me than almost anything else besides safety."
"""never use for connecting service""","Orlando to LOndon Heathrow via Atlanta. We have flown Delta before with no problems, and have rated them highly. However this time the flight from MCO was cancelled whilst we were waiting to board (""aircraft is broke""), and we were informed replacement was being sent from ATL, which wouldn't land at MCO until after LHR flight had departed. Mad panic with a full Boeing 757 passenger list trying to contact Delta customer services using the 6 available telephones. Eventually got through, and was offered flight from ATL to Paris, with a connection to LHR. Had to point out to the operator this would take-off whilst we were en-route to ATL. Eventually got offered flight to Philadelphia, to connect to a London flight the next evening. Asked if there was a way to contact England to advise our taxi company not to pick us up until following day. They said they had no international calling arrangements. Got to ATL about 10:45 at night, then spent about an hour trying to arrange overnight hotel (three quarter full flight, and 4 customer service clerks). Eventually given voucher for hotel, and told to wait at the hotel shuttle pick up point outside. Hotel shuttle didn't turn up, and wasn't listed on list of hotel contacts to allow us to contact it. Eventually driver from another hotel took pity on the 14 of us booked to that hotel, and took us there. The hotel also had no way of making international calls. Next morning we found voucher was for accommodation only - we had to pay for breakfast! Flight to Philly was ok-ish (a MD88 is not as good as a 757). London-bound plane was a half-empty 757. However, although Premium Economy was almost empty we were still only allowed in Economy unless we were willing to pay for upgrade. The only time previously we have had a rearranged flight, also because of broken aircraft, was with BA who automatically upgraded us. Was also surprised that , if we wanted to watch any of the films on offer, we would have to pay by credit card. Never had this before on a transatlantic flight - even Delta ones. However cannot fault the onboard flight crew or service. The seats, however were uncomfortable, and 9 hours is a long time to sit in an uncomfortable seat. When we got back to LHR, no checked baggage. They were delivered to our home later that day on 2 separate deliveries, because one had arrived on a later Delta flight from JFK, the other had arrived on an earlier Virgin flight, also from JFK! So, in addition to us having an extra wasted day, Delta have caused us to be out of pocket for meals we wouldn't have had to pay for, and a taxi that went to LHR to meet us. The in-flight experience is ok. It is the customer service side that needs attention. I would still use them, but never use them for a connecting service again."
"""close to flawless""","Our Delta Air Lines flights from Columbia to Seattle were close to flawless. All arrived ahead of schedule, so twice we had to wait about 15 minutes for a gate to become available. We traveled with just carry-on and were able to take our bags on-board even on full flights. We especially appreciated the overhead compartment valet service in Atlanta, our only experience. The Atlanta flight crew was also the most upbeat and friendly, but being fellow Southerners, perhaps that was the most familiar. Beverage service was often on our long flights. The only negative was a bit of crowding with an oversized passenger on a three seat row, but that couldn't be helped."
"""Thank you Delta""","I have not flown Delta in several years. Only because I find better prices on other airlines. I recently had the opportunity to fly Delta. I missed my connecting flight, but when I landed there was someone there to help me get another flight 30 minutes later. Their information was correct and informative. The desk person even checked to see if the original planes door had been locked. She then worked to get the next flight. The employees on and off the plane were so nice, polite and as helpful as you could ever want. They spoke with genuine politeness. They can cut your stress and truley make your trip relaxed and enjoyable. Thank you Delta."
"""regional planes on international routes""","New York JFK to London Heathrow with Delta. Time to put the old thing out to pasture. Seriously, Delta - get with it. We pay these extremely high prices and Delta Air Lines are still putting regional planes on international routes. Shame. Service, food and staff was all fine. This seat was the 1x2x1 configuration. I was in Seat 5A. I am 6'4"" and I can't fit when the bed is flat. I find the enclosed foot area very bothersome. The bathrooms are shared with economy class. It was small, and midway through the flight was filthy. I'd say if you were flying this route, make sure to stay away from the Boeing 767-400 equipment."
"""super flight""","Delta Air Lines from Los Angeles to New York JFK. Check in efficient. Bought a day pass and used the DL Skyteam Lounge at LAX Terminal 5. Simple but good selection of food. Drinks had to be paid for. Wifi good. Able to use clean showers. Boarding on time. Flight operated by Boeing 767-300ER with updated interior. Left on time. Friendly Cockpit crew and cabin crew good. Since red eye flight slept most of the way. Crew did 2 services during flight offering beverages for anyone awake. Good IFE. Arrived early. No issues at all. Again super flight."
"""never flying Delta again""","Never flying Delta again. My initial arrival time was supposed to be 9.54 pm, then plane had to turn around because of a mechanical problem. We got put on another flight around 11.15 pm, we made it to the runway, only to have to turn around and go back because the captain of the planes shift was almost over. Now having to wait until 2.30 am to catch another flight. This is ridiculous."
"""there was no IFE system""","SLC to ATL, Airbus 320. All staff were very friendly and professional. Boarding was orderly. The snacks offered in EC were very good. The food for sale was surprisingly good. My wife and I selected items that were in a brown paper bag and included 2 roast beef sandwiches, a bag of chips and cookies. My only complaint was that there was no IFE system. This could be that the flight was only 3 hours. Basically, I do not see much difference between first class and EC on Delta. I would say that I see more smiling faces from employees on Delta than on their competitors."
"""refused to let us on""","We booked on a Delta Air Lines buddy pass a few weeks before for a round trip. After arriving in Phoenix from Detroit we found out on the way home that the payment had been cancelled, and even though we were still listed online for the standby list, they refused to let us on. The airline attendants could not and would not explain how the pass was cancelled, why the payment was canceled, we tried logging in ourselves to rescheduled and the system wouldn't let us. The attendants were useless and we ended up borrowing a buddy pass from a complete stranger who felt bad for us. The airline system was unorganized, showing different information for us online and the airline attendants; the attendants knew nothing and did nothing to correct the situation, I was basically told to call customer service to reschedule my flight. They had even sent us a confirmation email that morning. What a joke! Totally not worth the cost when other airlines have pretty much the same rate with cheaper bag charges. I'm giving this airline a 1/10 because none of these other features matter if they can't even accurately communicate the status of your flight reservation."
"""not to fly them again""","I made a mistake booking to New York Friday with my family. Instead of 09.40am, I put it as pm on my phone when I booked it. I just caught and called Delta, they said it would be $700 change fee per person x 4 -the flight only cost me $1500 roundtrip for all four. Nice customer service, honest mistake and my whole family gets screwed over on a family vacation. I am a frequent flyer with Delta because of the hub in Detroit. I will do whatever I can not to fly them again."
"""pleasant and good experience""","New York JFK to Saint Martin return with Delta Air Lines. Check in good. Boarding process well managed. Prompt offer of beverage by engaging crew. Flights left on time and arrived 30 minutes before schedule. Both planes had personal IFE. Return Boeing 757-200 was a newer plane with new Boeing interior and comfy seats. Outbound flight meals were nice, return was so so. Efficient crew and who enjoyed their job. Pleasant and good experience."
"""impressed with the service""","Take off on time. Good leg space - paid £64 per seat to upgrade to Delta+ which is the premium economy section. The one negative is that if you are not a regular flyer with the carrier, online check in is a pain as the seat options are terrible and you have to pay extra to sit together. However, once on board, was impressed with the service and the timeliness. Aircraft looked better than any BA aircraft I have flown on recently. Very friendly FAs. Very bumpy flight across the pond but the crew kept serving water and juice through the flight. Lunch was good. Entertainment options are limited. I would not hesitate flying them again."
"""impressed all the way around""","San Francisco to New York with Delta Air Lines, and very impressed all the way around. On the ground the Delta club was quite comfortable with a vast array of breakfast items: juice, good selection of fruits, bread, pastries, hot and cold cereals, espresso machine. The new Delta One seat is very good (obviously made by the same supplier for the SWISS business class long haul seats). It is lie flat and seats have direct aisle access. Service on board attentive and friendly. Food a notch above. The usual fruit selection and omelet, but Delta added a smoke salmon plate. Flight on time. IFE decent. On the whole I liked the product."
"""thrown together on the cheap""","New York to London with Delta Air Lines. We started off with a very helpful member of staff who checked us in at the screens before we queued to drop our bags off. It all went downhill from there! A misery behind the desk couldn't engage in conversation or even make eye contact before telling us that our seats would be allocated at the desk. She also told us that as we had the same reservation, the seats would be together. Good news as we are newly weds. After waiting at the gate, 15 minutes before scheduled boarding, we had to change to another gate. Pilot/co-pilot announces to the passengers that there was an issue with a fuel pump with the previous plane. (Is that courteous or unnecessary)? Unnessecary for the less confident passengers waiting among us. Over an hour late boarding and we are told that our seats aren't together after all!! The joke of the matter is that when we board, I was sat in the centre of a married couple in an aisle of three seats! That is just total incompetence! Obviously I changed seats with them! Food was barely edible, the orange juice with breakfast was still frozen! Seat pocket was torn, the cabin was shabby and tired. Delayed by +2 hours. It's like this airline has just been thrown together on the cheap and the service and comfort and colour scheme (navy blue, red and bright pink?!) reflects this."
"""cabin crew were very nice""","It started off as a short delay because the captain didn't show up, the cabin crew were very nice and interacted with the passengers whilst the delay was on. Once we got going, the crew was amazing, young, etc. The uniforms and cabin were very up to date and nice. We arrived only 5 minutes later than our initial arrival time. The cookies and complementary beverages were great."
"""extremely disappointed""","Extremely disappointed with the flight attendants on this Delta Air Lines flight. Never in my life have I seen such laziness or disrespect. I recently had major spine surgery and have lifting restrictions so I asked for help with putting my bag in the overhead compartment. The flight attendant gave me a dirty look, told me no, said that ""people like you"" shouldn't be allowed to have a carryon if I couldn't lift it, and went back to her conversation with her co-worker! I'm disabled, not stupid. I've never been treated so badly in my life. Overall, terrible experience."
"""nice flight attendants""","My flight with Delta Air Lines from London to New York was good. Very nice flight attendants, nothing to say about the check in and airport experience as in transit. A nice IFE system, and food was ok. The only downside were the seats which were too small and not comfortable."
"""very disappointed with my flight""","I was very disappointed with my Delta Air Lines flight from Honolulu to Salt Lake City. The male flight attendant that serviced my area in First Class was rude and impatient conversing with me. I couldn't hear him as he was asking me a question about what I wanted to eat. He had to ask me three times due to my hard-of-hearing. He rolled his eyes, then strred at me for my answer as he asked, “do you want meal?” The person next to me overhead light did not work. My light switch worked her light. The male flight attendant kept telling the lady next to me how to touch the screen because, ""it's sensitive, just like me"". This is all done without a smile. How Rude!.And no can tell me that's Hawaii humor. Never during the flight did a flight attendant smile or have any gestures of kindness. One third of the way into the flight, my video screen didn't work. The flight tracker didn't work. I couldn't watch my video. When I told a female flight attendant she just said that she would, ""be sure to tell them to write it up"". No apology! So, I just stared at other peoples monitors without sound because I couldn't even read cause my light didn't work and my switch controlled the person sitting next to me! In defense of Delta. I had four other stops (back and forth) and they were all ok to good service."
"""surprised their quality of service""","After being stranded by Hainan Airlines, Delta stepped up and not only was able to get me on a flight at a competitive rate, but I was surprised their quality of service, seat room and meals as well as waiting area accommodations were all superior to what I've been putting up with for years. Absolutely no doubt both my wife and I will do all our travels to China with Delta from now on, but they will get our recommendation at every opportunity."
"""No problems with Delta""","Travelled Delta Air Lines premium comfort from LHR to Seattle then returned to UK from Honolulu via Seattle three weeks later. Pleasantly surprised to see that the Honolulu Seattle leg of this trip only cost about £200 or so than the round trip flights from London to Seattle even though it is a five hour journey - perhaps because it is an internal USA flight and not international. Anyway, the first leg when off without a hitch, seat comfortable, food fine entertainment good. The trip from Hawaii to Seattle was overnight, a little less comfortable (it was an economy seat) than the trans Atlantic and packed as an early flight had been cancelled some months earlier. Myself and others offered to have our hand held put in the hold and this worked fine as these bags were the first ones off in Seattle. Third leg was going fine 'til we started take off down the runway. Whereupon the plane slowed and returned to the gate. Apparently a generator had failed so we de-planed and waited 3 hours for a replacement. We were kept informed all the time and given snacks and beverages. Just as about a 100 pizza boxes arrived they announced we could re board and off we went. Unfortunate delay but these things happen and otherwise a routine flight back across the pond. No problems with Delta."
"""will not help with a hotel""","Last minute flight so I paid $750 CAD for this roundtrip in premium economy. Flight to SFO was smooth - with connection in Seattle. Flight home was bad: I arrived SFO at 11:45 am for 2pm flight. I received a message from Delta that flight was delayed and to contact them. I left the gate, through security, to check-in desk and they advised that the new departure of 2:38 was still good for my connection. Back to the gate, where before boarding an offer was announced to provide a $400 voucher for anyone who would stay behind, which I did not select because I had plans. We boarded at approx 2:30. Approx 2:45 the captain announced we would be held at the gate. We took off at approx 3:10 - at this point I knew I would need to rush to catch connection, which was from different terminal in LAX. We landed LAX &and were held on the tarmac, I deplaned at approx 4:48 to catch departing flight to Calgary Canada on WestJet (codeshare) at 5:05. I obtained assistance through security and ran to the gate in my socks to find the flight gone. I called Delta - they said the next flight would be the next morning. I went back to the other terminal and to the help desk - where we spent over an hour looking at every connection I could find (Vegas, Salt Lake, Vancouver) but every flight had a connection too close to make it home - so I gave in and arranged for the morning flight on WestJet. I asked for Delta to provide me with a Hotel - the answer was no. Supervisor gave me a discount voucher. Next I went downstairs to get my luggage. I was told it was with WestJet and I could not get it because WestJet personnel were not there, but not to worry it would be on my flight tomorrow. I got upset and the very helpful team actually went over got my luggage. Now it is 8:30pm, 3.5 hours after my flight landed. I entered the website for the hotel, as per directions on the coupon. Site was blank for LAX. I called the phone number on the voucher and was told there was no availability for LAX! I called my husband - who went on the internet to search Airport hotels - everything was showing as FULL or over $350 for a 2 star. Thinking this was only because of how late it was, I called several of these hotels and was told they were indeed booked. I was offered expensive hotels miles away - no shuttle. I needed to be at the airport 2.5 hours before my 8am International flight (because I did not have a boarding pass with the change, I was told to arrive extra early for the flight). So this was unacceptable - I went back up to the Delta help desk to tell them to get me a hotel. I was again told by the supervisor they will not help with a hotel. Agent even left to confirm the voucher was not valid and hotels were indeed booked. I saw they had a flight posted leaving LAX at 9:45pm to Oakland (same are as SFO). I asked to be put on that flight but they would not do it - saying that was 2 legs and I only had 1 leg of my flight left. I had to pay $305 ($400 CAD) for 1 way to OAK, as flight was leaving and decision had to be made. Terrible"
"""was pleasantly surprised""","Used Delta Air Lines for the first time, flying from London to New York JFK in October 2015 and I was pleasantly surprised. The flight was on time, boarding was smooth. The supply of food, snack and drinks was really good. The quality of the food was pretty good and they serve pretty big portions too. The plane was a Boeing 767, seats in the economy section are pretty much standard, but more comfortable than other airlines I have used. Entertainment wise, there was a good selection of films and TV series to choose from. Overall it was a very good flight (better than my return flight with Virgin Atlantic) and I would use them again."
"""friendly and helpful cabin staff""","I'm submitting this review because of what I thought was outstanding friendly and helpful ground and cabin staff during this trip from Los Angeles to Cincinnati via Dallas Fort Worth. This trip was remarkable for how polite, patient, and free-from-corporate-speak the ticket agent, gate agent, and cabin crew were to me - an experience I had not had with Delta in years past. My flights were punctual and the leg room was tight, but not unreasonable."
"""unusually cramped cabin""","Delta Air Lines from Seattle to Anchorage in exit row. Delta has an unusually cramped cabin, even in First Class, so I was relieved to get the exit row. On takeoff, a strip of plastic from the overhead bin compartment fell off and hit me and the guy behind me in the head repeatedly. It was light enough that it was an inconvenience rather than a cause for alarm or injury, but it does call maintenance into question. Then the cabin crew proceeded to serve six bottles of booze to the gentleman seated next to me, despite the fact that he was visibly intoxicated after the first four. Not sure how he'd assist with the emergency exit when he was drunk enough to begin making phone calls as soon as we could see the destination in the distance and yelling obscenities into his phone. Cabin crew ignored this just as they ignored the fact that they over served him beyond any reasonable margin of error. They'd sell him six bottles of tequila, but they only came through the cabin to provide half glasses of ice with a splash of soft drink on a three hour flight. This is on par with what I've come to expect from Delta Airlines. At least I wasn't in First Class this time, and had some leg room (Delta's First Class cabin is as tightly packed as their steerage class rows.)"
"""fulfilled my expectations""","Los Angeles to Las Vegas with Delta Air Lines. Punctual, comfortable and nice crew, and the flight fulfilled my expectations. The Boeing 717 is a nice and silent plane, especially if you fly first rows. No real catering was offered, but was else can you expect on a 45 minutes flight, just drinks and snacks service. The seats are comfortable, wide and with sufficient distance to the next row. Boarding process fluent and prompt take off. The SkyClub lounge in LAX is fantastic!"
"""cramped beyond belief""","Las Vegas to Atlanta with Delta Air Lines. Uncomfortable seats, cramped beyond belief and incredibly rude staff throughout the flight. The check in staff were good. Won't be flying with them again given the choice."
"""good luck if you fly Delta""","After our flight was delayed from Maui to LAX, we missed our flight. When we landed, the gate was taken so then we missed the last flight of the night. We then had to stay the night in the airport with no accommodation offered. The customer service is absolutely horrible, staff is rude. I say make them sleep on an airport floor for a night, and then tell me they're sorry for the inconvenience. Every gate attendant I dealt with has been rude and not wanting to find flights for us, and acted as though I asked them to do something that was impossible. I would never recommend flying with Delta to my worst enemy. An announcement came over they were offering $500 vouchers for people to give up their seats, when we were offered nothing for them making us miss our flights. To put icing on the cake, they removed our checked bags and now have no idea where they are. Good luck if you fly Delta."
"""delayed 3.5 hrs""","On the 4 flights within a week - 1st flight was delayed 2 hrs, missing the connecting flight (technical issue, we were not on board) - 2nd flight went ok - 3rd flight was delayed 3.5 hrs, missing the connecting flight (infotainment system down, we were on board and the 34 deg C heat was too much for A/C). They sent us to a luxury hotel. 4th flight was delayed 1.5 hr (they just realized that the captain had too many hours). What kind of company is this? Will not fly again with them, given a choice."
"""FAs competent and courteous""","My spouse booked this flight six weeks prior to departure. She has platinum status on Delta, but was unable to obtain an economy comfort upgrade. She was also unable to purchase economy comfort seats (none available), so we ended up in economy. As with the flight from SLC to CDG, the seats in the return CDG to SEA flight were the worst I've experienced - cramped, inadequate padding, solid armrests, and hardly any recline. This was a day flight - I didn’t sleep well the night before, and was unable to take a nap. Seat discomfort made my flight experience miserable. My spouse and I forgot to bring our seat backs to the upright position before landing at SEA, and the FAs didn’t notice. That’s how minimal the recline is. Once again, food quality had deteriorated from my last transatlantic Delta flight in January 2014. I forgot to buy take on food at CDG. Delta offered a wide selection of movies, but the free headset's poor sound quality made it impossible to enjoy them. My 1-star rating for entertainment is based on the headset’s poor sound quality. The FAs were competent and courteous, my only positive comment for this flight."
"""disappointed by service""","Delta Air Lines from Boston to Indianapolis, and it was just an utter mess. There was no direction given and no updates given. I have been staring at a previous flight still on-boarding, meanwhile their flight already took off. I'm highly disappointed by the quality of service. Oh and our gate just changed - for the third time."
"""not allowing flight to land at LGA ""","Trying to fly home to see my family. After delaying constantly for 4 hours and refusing to let us get off the plane while they wait for us to be able to take off. The pilot proceeds to promise we will take off (I don't blame the pilot). The airline said that they would not be allowing my flight to land at LGA due to a lack of space at the airport. The pilot proceeded to ask if we could land in a different airport so that our whole weekends weren't ruined. The airline basically refused to do anything to help myself and several others in the same position. To say the least I am fuming, in tears, and very frustrated with Delta Airlines. Especially since when we were leaving the airplane they were required to play the audio tape ""Thanking for choosing Delta""."
"""will not fly Delta again""","Richmond to Atlanta. Beware that Delta Air Lines cheaper tickets do not allow you to sit with your flying partner. You have to pay more just to fly seated together. Rip off! I will not fly Delta again."
"""flight delayed because captain was missing""","First my Delta Air Lines flight got delayed but I was able to re-book it the night before. The guy who answered my call was not very understanding and frustrated me even more. Then the morning of my flight I got there 3 hours early (3:00 am) only to be told that the flight was delayed because the captain was missing. I missed my connecting flight which meant I had to be re routed and had to wait six hours in New York. I was supposed to get to DC at 10 AM and got there at 4:30 pm. Wasted my day at the airport. Coming back, my flight was again delayed and I once again missed my connecting flight. I had to book to another flight. It was a direct flight but basically had to wait 6.5 hours at the airport for it to take off. Then my gate for the new flight got changed twice. Then my 12:22 flight got delayed again to 2:00pm or so. I was supposed to be in Montreal at noon and instead arrived at around 3:10 or so. The one positive was that the direct flight was extremely fast and made it to Montréal in an hour and 10 minutes. My carry on met the specifications but I was told to leave it on the side of the entrance of the plane because it did not fit in the overhead cabinet? So why do you give specs that do not work? That would be ok except that one of the zippers in my luggage got ripped off and there was a tear on the side of the luggage. Way to take care of my stuff guys. I admit that the staff were very nice and they tried to be understanding. I received a 50$ voucher to use at a later date but will I really use this airline again? Do I want to take a chance? How many delays can a human being take in one trip? They also gave me a 15$ voucher to eat at the airport because I had to wait so long. I understand stuff happens. I understand that sometimes things are out of people's controls. But my experience at Delta was a complete waste of time and either they are extremely incompetent or I am extremely unlucky as a traveller."
"""staff very friendly and helpful""","Delta Air Lines from London Heathrow to New York JFK. The seats in economy are a little cramped. My friend and I are 5ft 10 and 6f t3 and we felt squashed especially when the person in front reclined their chair. However, that was the only negative. The IFE had a good range of movies, and the food was satisfactory. The staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all, a good experience. Although, I will book exit row seats the next time. As long as you get to your destination safely, consider it a good flight."
"""continue to fly with them""","London Heathrow to Tampa via Atlanta return with Delta Air Lines. Only the return flight was delayed 45 minutes but captain passed through the cabin to apologise about the delay. Food was ok usual standard airline fare but choices available, beer and wine was free on the international flights. AVOD on transatlantic flights with a good choice of movies and tv shows, bit disappointed in the audio selection though and this could be improved. Flight attendants passed through the cabin regularly on drink runs offering water or orange juice. This is my fourth time flying Delta Air Lines and will continue to fly with them if their prices remain competitive,"
"""much improved experience""","Flew by Delta after a really long time. The aircraft used between SEA and Atlanta looked very new with video monitors for every seat and the mood lighting was very refreshing. The crew also greeted everyone pleasantly with a smile. All in all a much improved experience."
"""attendants very courteous ""","Flights on time, attendants very courteous and helpful. In Columbus I explained to the Delta clerk that I was scheduled for knee replacement surgery and could I get a wheelchair in Atlanta to make my connecting flight. When I arrived I was met by a very friendly lady who zipped me thru the airport to my connecting flight. I would not have made it without her. I received the same service on the way back home. All luggage on time as well."
"""Delta service is horrific""","Security wait times in Atlanta were 1 hour (October 3). Priority lines were empty and instead of expediting passengers with tight times, everyone was left to work through the full line. Missed flight by 1 minute, and rather than rebook me on next flight they sent me to other side of airport to get on standby. More bad service (no ability to tell me number on standby). I took another train to new flight only to find I was #4 on a full flight. Next available would be three hours later. I left and went to Southwest and bought next flight out which left 20 minutes after the standby flight. Delta service is horrific all the way through starting with gate agents, security staff (not TSA but delta gate staff - one of whom argued with me for 5 minutes on the difference between priority boarding and first. Had they been clearer maybe I would have made flight). Legroom is non existant. People not helpful. Last last last last time I ever fly this awful airline."
"""the worst travel experience""","This was hands down the worst travel experience in my life. Apparently the Delta Air Lines flight out of Florence was cancelled to due wind. Delta (and their partner KLM) had my flight bussed to the Pisa airport, (with no explanation, the pilot on the next flight explained). There we were told that we'd be dropped off at our plane that was ""waiting"" and no worries about our connecting flights in Amsterdam. There was no plane waiting in Pisa. We were dropped off with no direction in the Pisa airport parking lot, we had to go back through security and stand in lines trying to figure out which flight we were suppose to take. By the time we made it to Amsterdam the connecting flights were long gone. The KLM/Delta service people, were rude and unhelpful. They would tell us to get in a specific line, where'd we'd wait for over an hour, then they tell us to go to a different part of the airport and get in a different line. The connecting flights that were missed for some reason could not be rebooked at the airport and we were told we had to call Delta ourselves and reschedule. To which, after two attempts at 1.5 hours each spent on hold I was finally able to rebook my flight at an international calling rate of $2 an hour, so I spent over $400 just to rebook the flight. That doesn't include the rest of the costs I incurred at my two days at the airport. And of course they lost my luggage. And of course they don't care. I just keep getting transferred over to different ""customer service lines"" where I have to wait on hold and then repeat everything. So I still don't know where my luggage is and I have a new customer service number that I need to call tomorrow. I hate Delta and KLM and I will try to avoid these airlines if at all possible in the future."
"""by far the worst service""","This is by far the worst service and flying experience and I will never fly Delta Air Lines again. The baggage clerks are rude. When I made my flight reservation I said I need an aisle or window seat and the phone clerk said there is plenty of seats. Come to find when I check in it won't let me change my seats and no one can seem to help me. On top of all that I had to pay 235$ for my two bags. My advice to anyone thinking about booking with Delta is not to - Southwest are cheaper and all around more comfortable and easier to fly."
"""last time I fly Delta Air Lines""","We were held up in Nashville for an hour and we were forced to miss our connecting Delta Air Lines flight to Phoenix. On board the flight attendant assured us that the company would put us upon a hotel for the night. They didn't and they would pay for it either. First and last time I fly Delta Air Lines."
"""lack of care their workers showed""","I have flown Delta thinking that they were the best. Until my flight from LAX to SLC was rerouted to Grand Junction where we sat on the tarmac for 3 hours. I know they cannot help weather, which is not what upsets me. It is that once I finally landed in SLC my next flight to Billings had just taken off. Again, I know not something they can help. At this point everything for the next 24 hours was booked, there wasn't even a hotel they could get me in for the night. Again, not something that they can control. So I rented a car and drove through the night on my own accord and expense. The complaint is that when I went to get the ticket refunded I called customer service before even leaving the airport while the flight to Billings was in the air and they insisted that I needed to wait until I completed my flight back to Honolulu before anything could be done. So 2 weeks later, I get back and make a call. Somehow it says that I flew the flight. Every person I called said that they couldn't do anything and gave me another number to call or sent me to the airport. It took me another 2 weeks of calling everyday to find someone who had any idea and knowledge on what to do. I have people telling me to go to the airport and others saying there was no need to go to the airport and they were sorry I was sent there. Well the person who knew what they were talking about, sent me back to the airport and told me who to talk to. I had to get a letter from the airport stating that I didn't fly on that flight. Now, almost a month after getting that paper and 2 months after not getting on that flight, I finally get an email saying it is up for review, but I need a letter from my bank stating that it is okay to give a cash refund. I am so sick and tired of the terrible customer service and the lack of care that 99% of their workers showed. Being that I live in Hawaii, I am 6 hours behind their time, I have had to get up early on my days off just to make sure that I can get through to speak with anyone. I even had a lady say to stay up and call when they open. Oh yes, I am going to stay up till 2am my time to only be frustrated to now end so that I can sleep for 2 more hours and get up to watch children. That sounds like such a grand idea."
"""very helpful and professional""","I visited my daughter in June and the Delta Air Lines crew were very helpful and professional. I had recently had unexpected surgery earlier in the week and was having so much pain, I called and asked if I could have my flight moved up so I could go home earlier. After I gave them the information to prove my situation they were incredibly kind, and helped me move up the date. I again recently called them because I had purchased tickets for some family members and these had to be changed, and again were kind and refunded my tickets. They went above and beyond and I am very grateful for their kindness."
"""much better than Virgin Atlantic""","After booking return flights from London to New York with Virgin Atlantic, I was informed that the outward leg of our journey was a Delta Air Lines codeshare flight. I had heard bad things about Delta but my flight with them was extremely pleasant. Food service was extremely prompt, despite sitting near the back of the plane, and the attendants were helpful. Large bottles of water were handed out regularly. As a nurse I was glad to see that they had taken their passenger's health and hydration to heart. It was a much better experience than the Virgin Atlantic flight on the return journey, where I was hungry and thirsty for much of the flight, and the entertainment system crashed multiple times!"
"""every flight has been very delayed""","We spent $3,000 on these Delta Air Lines tickets and every flight has been very delayed. One of the delayed flights coming home made us miss our connecting flight and the service person told us it was not their fault (air traffic fault), and told us there was nothing they could do. We finally get booked for another flight 24 hours later after not having our luggage and having to buy a hotel, food, clothes, miss work to now find out they have a broken plane. We have been trying to get home now for almost 3 days. We travel all the time and have never experienced such a terrible travel experience and will never give this airline a penny every again."
"""seats horrible and extremely noisy""","We got tickets for this flight a day before departure via American Airlines, because we missed their flight and they put us on Delta. This flight to ATL was horrible, because of our seats. We got seats at the very last row next to the engines. These seats are horrible and extremely noisy. Although the flight was 1,5 hour, we were still deaf an hour after landing. There was no inflight service by the cabin crew due to the weather conditions. I've heard this flying on multiple flights by DL. Although flight-safety is priority one, in my opinion there was no trouble with the weather to not deliver cabin service."
"""spacious cabin, comfortable seats""","We went up the Delta Air Lines gate agent and asked for an upgrade or the confirmation we had good seats, as we had missed a lot of sleep due to bad aircraft seats. The DL staff tried to help us out, and we ended up with a middle row (3 seats) for the two of us, which was excellent for us to get some rest on this 8 hour flight home. Boeing 767-400ER with a spacious cabin, comfortable seats, good looking interior and mostly friendly cabin crew. I didn't like the food served. From a quality standpoint it was good, but it just didn't taste good (pasta and chicken)."
"""Service fine on all flights""","Philadelphia to Salt Lake City on a new Delta Air Lines A320 in Premium Economy. Seat was comfortable, plenty of leg room. Boarding not an issue. Full flight but only backpack so no big deal. Snack fine, Delta cookies, candy and drinks. FA's polite. Return was Boeing 757 from SLC to Detroit and A320 from Detroit to Philly. Again 320 was fine, the 757 was older, had not been upgraded so was pretty cramped. Service fine on all flights."
"""never flying Delta again""","We were notified 2 hours before our boarding time that our Delta Air Lines flight was cancelled and that we had been rebooked on a flight 5 hours later. After calling a Delta representative for an explanation, she informed us that we had to talk to a ""Delta representative"" which required a 30 minute wait in the airport at their ""special services"" line. This representative told us there was nothing she could do. As a result we missed a show we had spent $200 on. After waiting 7 hours in the airport we boarded our new flight and proceeded to sit at the terminal in a 90 degree hot, full plane, for 30 minutes as they worked on repairs to the plane. They attempted to connect exterior air conditioning to the plane but that unit was also not working. After 30 minutes they told us to grab our luggage and deplane. Currently still waiting at the gate 30 minutes after we were supposed to land in Portland. Never flying Delta again!"
"""Last time I will ever book with Delta""","Delta Air Lines royally screwed my entire trip. So first time to go to Vegas and I was so excited. My friend is a platinum member with Delta so we booked our flights with Delta. Our flight was supposed to leave at 3pm and we stayed at the airport until 10pm because there was an every hour delay, finally left and came back in the morning. So one day of our trip which I was supposed to be enjoying in Vegas was lost. We come back the next morning and Delta says that we already got on the plane? We were standing right in front of the lady so we have to wait another 2 hours to get that fixed. Finally got on a plane - get to Vegas late in the day - only to find our luggage lost. So a whole day and half of our trip dealing with plane issues and then only to come to Vegas with no clothes, shoes, or anything. Last time I will ever book a flight with Delta."
"""rude agents and zero communication""","I sat at GGT for 8 hrs because Delta Air Lines had a mechanical issue. No food, no proper toilet facilities, no proper seating, rude agents and zero communication. Delta provided a $15 credit per person for a dive bar across the street that ran out of food and it was the only place to purchase food. When we complained upon arrival at Atlanta 11 hours later, we were given a 7500 miles for two people."
"""the flight attendants were excellent""","On my Delta Air Lines flight to Philadelphia from Detroit, the flight attendants were excellent - attentive to passenger needs, upbeat and proactive. Their in-flight review of safety procedures contained a bit of humor, which we enjoyed. During the flight I accidentally pushed the ""call button"" - but I was helped to find the reading light in the dark and there was no criticism. A pleasant experience, after I had been humbled by TSA employees, who really do know how to make flying unpleasant. I cannot recall the names of these flight attendants, but I was on flight DL1749 on Sept. 19, 2015. Thanks!"
"""never again will I book a Delta flight""","Arrived at airport at 3.50 am to find out the flight was ""delayed"" until 4pm later that day, because the plane did not come in the night before. No notification just let us get up and drive to the airport at 3:50am. After some time on the phone we managed to get a milk run to Salt Lake city taking three different flights to get there and only arriving 2 hours later than originally anticipated. Not so bad considering we spent 17 hours traveling from Halifax to Salt Lake. Return flight, they get us to Mey York on time but the connector home is delayed again another three hours. No compensation. Nothing. Lots of I am sorry but this company doesn't value customers time consistently. Claiming weather is the problem in Washington when we are leaving NYC for Halifax and the weather is fine in both spots. I don't understand what Washington rain has to do with it. Very frustrated. My last flight with Delta was the same, lost a days vacation at Walt Disney for a family of five because of mechanical failure and flight cancellation. They provided us 100 dollar travel vouchers each to fly Delta within 1 year that we never got to take advantage of and they expired. Never again will I book a Delta flight."
"""an overall pleasant experience""","An overall pleasant experience. I upgraded to Delta Comfort+ on the first leg of the journey and chose seats right behind first class bulkhead. There was more than ample leg room. The Comfort+ seats also recline a little further as well, and include priority boarding and free drinks. At ANC airport, there were several other airlines with lines that seemed to go on forever, I think one of them was American. There was no line for Delta and the check in agents were friendly. Flight left on time, landed in ATL on time, and our connecting fight to Miami in a different terminal also was on time. While the MD-80 on the second leg was clean, and seemed to have been refurbished, I do not enjoy flying on those older planes as the cabin pressure is horrible. All bags arrived. Overall again, a pleasant experience. Its nice that Delta serves snacks in economy as well."
"""rescheduling statement is not true""","Purchased Delta Air Lines first class tickets from Portland to DC via Salt Lake, leaving at 1:39 pm. At 11:00 am Delta delayed flight so that we would be missing the connection. Their email said they would re-schedule us; the re-schedule was then supposed to be on the red eye, arriving the following day! When we went to ask if there wasn't space on an earlier flight (they had several in the afternoon, going to DC), we were told no - every seat taken. As we sat waiting in the lounge, another passenger overheard our situation and told us she had just been upgraded to first class on one of these flights and there were open seats on them. When we inquired again, the Delta rep admitted that there were in fact first class seats available on those other afternoon flights, but our first class tickets could not be transferred to these seats and they are not allowed to switch us to those seats - different code (?) I feel sorry for the employee who had to explain this embarrassing rip off to us. So after making our original itinerary impossible, Delta's ""code"" policy would not allow us to take available seats on the other afternoon flights, forced us to sit in the Portland airport for 12 hours and then take a red eye flight overnight and arrive 24 hours after our original check in. Nice going Delta. The statement on Delta's rescheduling itinerary form ""we're dedicated to getting you to your destination as soon as possible"" is not true."
"""staff were courteous and extremely friendly""","My son and I recently flew Delta Air Lines out of Harrisburg to Atlanta, then on to Denver. This was our 3rd annual trip, previously we flew another airline, this year it was Delta. All the staff were courteous and extremely friendly and helpful. It was refreshing and I would recommend Delta and it will be our airline of choice. All of our flights arrived ahead of time."
"""flight attendants courteous, seats comfortable""","Afternoon flight on Delta Air Lines from Reagan National to Minneapolis. Initial departure was delayed for a half hour (I did not ask the reason). This was offset by the pleasant service I received gateside. I had a complicated route to take, and I asked to check my carry on (and lo and behold, it arrived at my final destination at the same time I did!). The flight was generally uneventful, flight attendants were courteous, the seats were comfortable. I found the A320 to be a very comfortable plane for economy class, and despite my proximity to premium economy, I didn't see them get excessively pampered. Overall, an enjoyable trip. The plane was clean (if a bit rattly on touchdown), and I was overall comfortable."
"""a comfortable and wonderful flight""","Delta Air Lines from Honolulu to Los Angeles on Boeing 767-300, and as this aircraft originated in Japan we were treated to an internationally configured aircraft which provided a comfortable and wonderful flight. The crew, especially the lead, were wonderful and efficient. Food and entertainment were also very good. A positive experience."
"""crew constantly chatting in the galley""","Delta Air Lines flight from Panama to Atlanta left on time. No welcome greeting when boarding the plane as the stewardess preferred chatting with the pilots in the cockpit. The crew showed a clear lack of interest and were constantly chatting in the galley about their working conditions. They did not bother to close the separation curtain between the cabins during the flight so passengers from the main cabin were eventually queuing up for the business class toilet (why paying business fare?) Breakfast was excellent. The crew on the flight to Brussels was very friendly, very professional. Food was excellent. In spite of the old 767 plane, the business class cabin offers decent comfort, although the seats/beds are a bit cramped indeed. IFE is up to standard."
"""Purser took such great care of us","We flew Delta Air Lines to New York from Manchester in August, and had a wonderful flight where we couldn't fault anything. The seats were comfortable, the inflight entertainment had everything you could want, food was great and the staff were excellent. The Purser on this flight took such great care of us."
"""incompetence and lack of accountability""","I have never been particularly impressed by any US airline but this Delta Air Lines trip to fly Seattle to Moscow via Paris takes the cake in terms of incompetence and lack of accountability. The flight was SEA-CDG-SVO and was initially meant to depart at 1:00pm. First delay was 4 hours for mechanical issues. This meant a rebooking of my connecting flight, no problem. Around 5:00pm, still no plane in sight. Around 6pm, announcement that plane was here and being prepped but needed to be fueled for the trip and the crew is about to be timed out so once the plane is ready, you better be ready to board. No problem. After more than 5 hours and only a couple of slices of cold pizza as compensation, we were ready to get out of there. Once boarded another announcement, some passengers did not board (they were the smart ones), so their bags have to be removed. One hour later, another announcement, as anticipated, crew is about to time out, solution is that we fly to MKE and change crew there (assured that there will be fresh crew in MKE - right). But then there is too much fuel on the plane, as it was meant to be a transatlantic flight. So have to remove some fuel in order to fly to MKE. An hour later, why have we not moved and why has air conditioning on the plane been turned off? They can’t figure out how to remove the excess fuel and turned off air conditioning to facilitate the removal but forgot to turn it back on! So around 9:00pm, rumors start circulating amongst the crew and those standing at the open door and gangway that the flight might be cancelled. At this point, that almost sounds like a blessing. By the time the announcement is made at 9:30pm that the flight is being cancelled, many of those in the know have already left the plane. So a mad rush to get off the plane and get rebooked and situated for the night. At time of rebooking they assure us that the same flight will be OK to go the next day at noon. Put you up at a hotel and here is a $15 meal voucher. Since its 10:00pm already, not a lot open at the airport to get a meal at. But weary and blurry-eyed, we are thankful for anything. Next day, refreshed for a night’s sleep and hopeful to finally get out of SEA, arrive at the airport again, go through the same drill, get through security, great, flight is still on time, go get coffee and walk to gate. Fellow passenger stops me mid-way to gate and tells me don’t bother, the flight has been cancelled again! Go to customer service and try to get rebooked. Get to customer service and line is a mile long and not moving. Opt to jump on the phone and try to get a flight. Lady on the phone rebooks me on a flight SEA-MSP-AMS-SVO. That’s one more leg than I’d like but heck, get me out of SEA! It is now 11:26am, the flight to MSP is scheduled to depart at 11:30am from a gate that I have to take an airport train to get to. Booking agent assures me that the departure time is actually 11:50am so I have time. Finally get rebooked, rush to gate. Get there at 11:32am. Gate has closed! Gate agent firmly states that flight was scheduled for 11:30, I am late and doors are closed. At this point, I am near tears. How do I get out of this airport?? My one piece of luck, the gate agent actually relents and reopens gate to let me on."
"""had a very good WIFI connection""","Returning home after a long holiday in the US, flying Delta Air Lines, Orlando to Amsterdam via Detroit. Departure from Orlando was delayed due to airport closure for lightning, the aircraft was an old Boeing 757-200 and age was clearly showing. There was no meal service even in first class, but the service was good, the Delta Airlines ground staff receiving the flight at Detroit were not interested in helping us with the connecting flight to Amsterdam - until one official at a different gate helped out. Detroit to Amsterdam flight was a newly refitted Boeing 767-400 with nice business class beds but the monitor screen was small and could not compare with competing airlines. I selected the vegetarian option on the food which was a cannelloni with goat cheese on a bed of spinach, a very bland and uncooked dish, the bottom half of the pasta was dry and hard there was a sprinkle of marinara sauce - not even enough to taste let alone to moisturize the pasta. Breakfast was a cereal which was OK. IFE selection was better than average on the international sector. Both sectors had a very good WIFI connection."
"""staff and service continued to improve""","Minneapolis–Saint Paul to Seoul Incheon, and Delta Air Lines staff and service has continued to improve over the last year. Ground staff and flight crew were all friendly and attentive. Inflight entertainment options are among the best and I like that you can access it before you are airborne and after you land and are taxiing. Seats are not comfortable especially on a transpacific flight but the added legroom of Economy Comfort is worthwhile."
"""we were pleasantly surprised by Delta""","Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by Delta's first class service from Lafayette to Montego Bay via Atlanta. Our LFT-ATL flight was operated with a Boeing 717 that appeared to be new inside, but was in fact a refurbished aircraft. The flight attendant greeted us warmly and professionally. There were pillows, blankets and bottled water at every seat in first class. On time departure and arrival. It would have been nice to have been served a hot breakfast snack on this 6:00am departure; however, only small snacks were offered. We made a quick 40 minute connection at ATL with no problem. Our ATL-MBJ flight was operated with an older Boeing 757-200 that had some age on it but was still in good condition with regard to first class cabin. Once again, we were greeted professionally and pillows, blankets, water at every first class seat. We were also greeted with a glass of sparkling wine. The breakfast burrito was pretty good as was fresh fruit served with breakfast. Beverages were kept topped up on a regular basis. Arrived just a few minutes late and our bags were among the first off the plane."
"""Basic Economy fare allows no choice of seat""","I am a long time Delta Air Lines flyer but the new Basic Economy fare allows no choice of seat. They say you can choose at check-in but there is no option to do so when you check-in online. Flew Washington DC to Atlanta, I ended up at the back of the plane for a flight which I had purchased 3 months in advance. Also, you can't use the e-pass which makes getting your boarding pass a lot more difficult."
"""think I am finished with Delta""","Delta Air Lines flight from Raleigh–Durham to Albuquerque via Atlanta was delayed 1hr 25min waiting for crew to arrive on another flight. Then came the aircraft change. I purchased a First Class ticket and was seated in seat 4B before the change. After change I was seated in Economy Comfort seat 16C. When the flight finally left RDU seats 5B/5C were empty, yet having paid for First Class I was left in Economy Comfort seat 16C. Arrived in ATL and discovered my flight to ABQ was still there, the reason, waiting for flight crew from my flight from RDU to ATL. Rode First class ATL-ABQ, however, my 2 bags didn't ride at all. One stayed in ATL and the other took a flight to SLC. The 2 bags did arrive at 1 PM the next day. Not a happy passenger. Biggest problem with Delta was nobody cared or wanted to hear about my problem. I think I am finished with Delta."
"""good value for the money""","It was good value for the money that I spent for this Delta Air Lines flight from Frankfurt to New York JFK. The new Business Elite Seats are good, the IFE seems to have some updates and run smoother than last time. You may complain that the lie-flat seat has a real narrow room for your feet, but value for money was good. I would have paid €200 more for Singapore Airlines on the same route, but I was too late. Delta is always a good option if you get a Z or J fare."
"""so uncomfortable and claustrophobic""","There have been a lot of negative comments of Delta Air Lines business Elite seats and I initially thought of them as being overly critical, until I had a first hand experience on my recent flight from JFK to Moscow. The seats are narrow, but so are many other airlines. What I liked was the configuration with single seats in a zigzag pattern on either side of the plane giving privacy to single travelers. Not much storage space, though. It's the tunnel like part of the pod where one's legs go in when the seat is in full flat position. The space is so confined that it's impossible to keep the feet straight up, forcing a person to lie on one's back only, unable to bend knees, requiring a contortionist skills to attempt sleeping on the side. The feeling is actually of being forced into a very narrow coffin. I honestly could never imagine being so uncomfortable and claustrophobic on a plane. I wonder if anyone at Delta actually tested the seats before installing them, certainly would fire those responsible for the decision! It ruined an otherwise highly pleasant flight, with professional and attentive crew, good and tasty food and extensive entertainment choices."
"""a great low cost carrier""","Flew Delta Air Lines from San Francisco to Montreal via Minneapolis/St Paul. I gave this trip 6/10 because the first flight was terrible, but the second was great. On the first flight, everything went wrong. My seat didn't recline, the flight attendants frequently ignored me, my window was stuck, there was no entertainment system whatsoever, and the flight arrived late at Minneapolis, which left me no time to get lunch. The second flight was better. The seats were spacious, the flight attendants were friendly, and best of all, my seat reclined. The only bad part is that we arrived late, yet again, but that's kind of a Delta signature move. I recommend this airline because it's a great low cost carrier for international travel, and it has never let us down before."
"""Endeavor Air was very good""","The connection was not managed by Delta but by its subsidiary Endeavor Air. The airplane was new and clean. I was skeptical about this company as it was the first time I flow it, but I have to admit it was very good. I will rate very low the ground service, thinking more about Delta than to Endeavor Air. Our original flight in the evening was cancelled and Delta did not provide any support to find an Hotel and to get at least a discounted fare."
"""will not be flying Delta again""","We have flown Delta Air Lines a number of times for the past four years mainly due to the availability of carriers on the dates we require. We will not be booking with them again as things are getting worse. We flew from Amsterdam to Orlando via Minneapolis and again were seated separately as a family, although we booked last year. Online check in did not allow seat allocation as system not available. Staff friendly, food good all considered. On enquiring why we were seated separately we were told because we booked online via a travel agent. I have travelled with many major airlines and have never had this problem. Coming back we checked in online. All okay, phone call automated saying flight was delayed 30 mins, no problem but at check in we were told that our flight was for the next day? So we went to customer services who apologised, and after 5 hours got on a flight with a different carrier via Germany to home taking 35 hours later! I have to say this is the last straw, our flight from Australia to home last year was shorter. We will not be flying with Delta again. Very dissappointed."
"""seat is comfortable and reclining""","Inside the Delta aircraft the cabin has been renewed, each seat has TV screen with a large selection of films (I mean films in Italian ). The seat is comfortable and it is reclining. Cabin crew is very helpful and kind, but the food is not so good. Aircraft is quiet and they give you a pair of earplugs and an eye shade. I was satisfied by Delta Air Lines."
"""excellent service with Delta""","Excellent service with Delta Air Lines. Plane food normally isn't enjoyable but thoroughly enjoyed on this flight. Staff were friendly and wished me a happy birthday while aboard. Entertainment variety was fantastic, and I would fly Delta again. Much better than Virgin Atlantic, plenty of leg space and very clean too."
"""plane was filthy""","This flight with Delta Air Lines was the worst service I have received. The plane was filthy. There was trash all over the place. The flight attendant was rude. When she started to hand out beverages I asked if I could have a can of Coke and she told me that because of other incompetent flight attendants, she didn't have enough drinks and would only give me a cup. We arrived 20 minutes later than scheduled, which left us 15 minutes to catch our connecting flight out of Detroit to DFW. The pilot never let us know our gate. We were told to look at the monitor when we got off the plane. My 60 year old mother and I had to run 46 gates in 15 minutes, only to arrive at the wrong gate because it had been listed incorrectly. When we arrived at the correct gate with 7 minutes to spare, they had already closed the plane doors and were preparing to take-off. I had to make a huge scene in order for them to re-open the plane doors and let us on the flight. They finally did once I brought up that we were not late and that they were leaving early. After nearly 10 hours of horrible service, we finally arrived in New York. I will never fly Delta Air Lines again."
"""staff seem uninterested""","Biggest problem is the transit in Atlanta. What a hell. More than 1 hour in line for passport control. Running to catch the connecting flight. Delta Air Lines staff seem uninterested, not very unfriendly. In-flight entertainment of very low quality and the touch screen hardly worked."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I wasn't impressed with Delta when we flew from Seattle to London Heathrow via Minneapolis. No over the head earphones so my husband who uses a hearing aid and only has hearing in one ear could not use the entertainment system at all. The entertainment systems were very small and some touch screens didn't work very well. Mine kept blinking on and off every two seconds which made watching a film difficult. The plane was freezing cold to the point where both me and my husband were physically shivering and it meant we could not sleep on the 9 hour journey at all. We alerted staff of our discomfort several times but they ignored us and the temperature stayed the same. On the shorter flights (3 hours Seattle to Minneappolis) there are entertainment systems but you have to pay $2 for headsets to use them. We tried to purchase a snackbox on board, but they wouldn't accept cash and would only accept card, which would have meant our bank charging us fees. Despite having only one hour changeover to check in for our next flight and go through security at Seattle, we got on the flight, but the airline managed to fail to send our bags, meaning we got them 26 hours after we should on arriving home. I have experienced much better service on other economy services on other airlines."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","BHM-ATL was okay, short (25 mins) but had welcome drink and time for one in the air. Fairly tight connection in ATL, so I was last to board first class cabin. I could see all other passengers had welcome drinks, but no-one offered me one. When I asked I was told I was too late! Things got worse from there. When asked what I wanted to eat the choice was steak or lasagne. I asked what came with the steak and was asked what I meant. I said I meant what comes with the steak? Not a difficult question I thought. So the FA goes back to the galley (I could see it all happen from my seat), opens a foil tray and comes back to my seat with one word - carrots! Talk about taking care of the customers. Eventually when my food arrived, sauce had been spilled all over and somehow under the tray. Not sure if this was intentional or not, but needless to say I didn't eat it! I've seen this kind of behavior before when FA's seem to vent on a customer for unknown reasons - I guess I drew the short straw on this flight. Generally I find Delta an pretty good airline, but this was not their best moment."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","All in all, a very good flight. Yes, the aircraft is old but has been nicely retrofitted by Delta to include modern IFE (with a decent selection included), and fairly comfortable, if firm, seats (use the complimentary pillow as a backrest if you need extra comfort). I had a window seat in the 2-3-2 layout, so much less cramped than other widebody aircraft. The crew were friendly and welcoming, and delivered a full service throughout the flight. Also, great value considering it was booked just two months before. Would definitely fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I'm usually very generous with my flight reviews of Delta. I'm a Gold elite and they are the airline of choice to and from the US for me. I think my loyalty has hit a wall. The good: the flight attendants are professional and the entertainment is pretty good as is the schedule options to and from the US from Japan. The bad: old planes, hard seats in business, small AVOD screens, dirty toilets, captains constantly using toilets in business class so passengers are blocked, mediocre food. On top of this, baggage snafu in ATL caused my travel partner and I to miss our connection on the way to RDU and they would not put us on the next available flight until I threw a fit. That's customer service in the US. You have to behave badly to be treated well. I'm considering the hot Japanese carriers on my next trip where I know the food and seats are superior. By the way, my ticket from NRT to ATL was an award ticket. I cannot imagine anyone paying over $5,000 for such an inferior product."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Its been 12 years since I've flown Delta. It will be another 12 before I even consider it again. Delta was horrible 12 years ago and has only gotten worse. Seats were filthy. We were told we had to check our carry on's because there was no room in the overhead compartments. When we boarded we saw that every compartment on both sides of the aisle behind, above and in front of our seats were totally empty. We waited 35 minutes to get our luggage. I unfortunately lost my cell phone at the gate and although I filed a report have been unable to get any information regarding my property. Humans are unavailable to speak to. Damn me if I get another Delta flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Just arrived after having the worst flight I have ever been on. Delta should lose the seat outside the toilets so you don't have to have inconsiderate people trying to push you over to the next seat with their behinds. This would also make it easier for food service trolleys to get by with out taking out your shoulder."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Our flight to Barbados from BOS went well with the exception of the dreadful egg wrap on the BOS-ATL leg. We were able to use the Delta lounge before departing BOS since we were in business class. On the return BGI-BOS via ATL flight, ATL Delta Lounge personnel informed us that ""flights to Barbados are not considered international."" Although our ATL to BOS leg was delayed over two hours (until an 11.15 pm departure), we could not use the Lounge unless we paid a $29 fee per person which we declined. Overall, our expense of flying Business or First Class to the Caribbean was not justified by the service, the food, or other amenities in the air or in the airport. Others should be aware that just because you need a passport to get into your destination, it's not Delta's definition of ""international."""
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Both outbound and inbound flights, in the evening/night, were more or less on schedule. What was surprising was on these 6 hours' long flights there was no food service, not even the food-for-sale, advertised on a card in the seat pocket. Yes, a packet of peanuts or pretzels were handed out. Furthermore, there was only one drinks service during the long flight. Catering really could be improved on this long, international flight. The plane was old with a minimalist entertainment system; there was a TV monitor hanging at intervals in the cabin and a movie was played. Free headsets were distributed. The crew distributed Canada immigration forms on board but did not have enough for all. I chose these flights for being non-stop but in retrospect, might have enjoyed the journey with a stop-over or flown a different carrier (e.g., Cathay Pacific) instead."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta is a standard airline, flight quality is average, but there customer service is so poor. I have been a Delta SkyMiles member for years and have had a few problems here and there but nothing serious until today. I tried to switch my connecting flight to New Orleans to a direct flight where there are 10 open economy seats. I was told that there were only first class seats and after showing the people at the Delta kiosk that they were wrong they got on the phone and then told me it was too late to switch even though the flight I would like to switch to does not board for two hours. The whole process took about 30 minutes and the staff was not the least bit sincere. I won't arrive into New Orleans until midnight, even though there are 10 empty seats on a flight that lands at 9.30. Terrible customer service, and genuinely poor business practices."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We took an afternoon flight and arrived close to midnight, though both planes were older 757-200 and did not have any personal entertainment system but you could see that the aircraft's were well maintained, the leather seats were all in good working condition and showed no age, though the food selection did not entertain vegans but the drink selection was very wide. The cabin staff were all helpful and the Internet was a huge plus. One of the nice things is we forgot one piece of cabin luggage on our first flight and we told the cabin staff of the second flight and they told operations and they transferred the piece to us so we where surorised to see it on the belt with our checked baggage."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta, as a whole, was very inconsiderate of the 'paying' customers. Measly snacks, hard seats, cold cabin, and when it comes to connecting flights - forget it. We were connecting to another Delta plane, which was the last to the east coast for the night and they refused to hold the flight despite the arriving flight from Denver being delayed. The ""help"" they gave us was useless and to say their customer service was inconsiderate would be an understatement"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight was delayed, the seats are very uncomfortable to sleep in as the headrest does not stay in place. Staff acted irritated when I asked them about this. The extra legroom seats feel very narrow, and I'm 160 lbs and 5'11"". The plane was freezing the entire flight, and the entertainment system was not working for the first 2 hours of the flight. An awful experience for $850."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My family and I were getting ready to fly to Hawaii on a family vacation. Due to mileage reasons, we had to fly Delta though we usually fly Alaska. When we arrived at the airport and checked in at the Delta front desk to check our bags, they're seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding our 3 hour layover in San Jose. However, the lady at the desk assured us that everything was cleared up and our bags would make it on the plane with us. After a 3 hour flight delay and having to get off the plane because a flight attendant got injured, we finally took off, barely making our connecting flight in San Jose (we landed at 6.10, got off at 6.20 and our flight was taking off at 6.35). We had to sprint to our connecting flight. After arriving in Hawaii, our bags never arrived at baggage claim. We weren't too concerned at first, thinking that the bags probably just didn't make our connecting flight in San Jose but would be sent over shortly after. After waiting for the next flight arriving from Seattle to see if our bags came on that flight, they never did. Long story short, we ended up never getting our bags until 4 days after arriving in Hawaii. The whole thing was an absolute nightmare and my family and I will never be flying Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DL2039, ATL to SEA in economy class on August 4 and DL2327, SEA to ATL in Comfort Plus on August 11. Flight attendant crew on both flights were engaging with the passengers and provided great service. Was able to purchase meals both ways, which were very good. Flights departed and arrived on time. Especially nice was the video on demand with a wide selection of programs to watch. Added cost of Comfort Plus was worth it, with priority boarding, upgraded free snack and free alcoholic beverages if desired."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew LAX to YVR. Check-in at LAX was actually a wonderful experience. Checked-in at the dedicated first class area, staff were polite and helpful. Departure from LAX was delayed one hour. On board the seat was filthy, seat pocket full of dirty napkins and plastic from the previous flight. The fast turn around in LA obviously did not include a cleaning of the cabin. Cabin crew seemed very inexperienced. Only one flight attendant serving first. Took meal and drink order one at a time, then went back and very slowly prepared it. I cannot say she was rude, but she was not pleasant either. Just robotic in her job. No offer of second drinks, or any ongoing service for the rest of the flight. She just stood in the galley, playing with her phone. When we were close to descent for Vancouver, I asked her if we were going to receive any arrival documentation for customs. She replied, ""oh yeah, I forgot about that!"" She and her coworker than proceeded to distribute the forms as we began our descent. Arrived in Vancouver about 45 minutes late. All in all, the fare was cheap, but so was the service. Perhaps I expect too much from North American based airlines."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","First we flew LAX to Savannah via Atlanta. The plane was late every step of the way. My twin 9 year olds and I were going for a small vacation, then to pick up a dog in Valdosta, GA and back home to LA. The LAX personnel with only one exceptional woman were surly and unhelpful. Because I was picking up a dog on the way back, I couldn't pick up my boarding pass electronically. The lines for help were long and the electronic rejection gave no answer. I tried to get help from 3 different Delta personnel, these were women who were recounting their evenings the night before and had no desire and felt no need to interrupt their gossip with work. Finally I found a friendly face among in the Delta line-up and this woman helped. The air crew was surly. Didn't think it was their job to help put up a bag. Turned up her little nose when my son asked for a drink. Atlanta to Savannah they held us on the tarmac 2 hours. Horrible. The way back was even worse. They were nice enough in Valdosta - which is so tiny they sort of have to be - nevertheless they body-searched an 80 year old woman in security. As usual the plane was delayed at Atlanta. Here there was no help available once you got there. Surly personnel. As a Amex Platinum card carrier, I was told I had the right to use the Delta Lounge. Since I was carrying a puppy and had my boys, we went to the lounge. The rude pretentiousness was shocking, and they refused to let us in the lounge. I called Amex and filed a protest and they called - but at that point I'd seen the pitiful offerings and decided to take the kids to PF Changs. The flight to LA was delayed 1.5 hours. When I got to the gate, I asked the girl at the desk what time the plane would actually board. The rude young women snapped at m: ""I just said that it would be in 1/2 an hour..."" I answered her: Obviously I just got here and didn't hear you or I wouldn't ask. Really, Delta? This is who you consider an appropriate employee? That's professional? Other passengers were complaining about her and about her male cohort. To board the plane it was complete chaos. Like being in a Third World country with a free-for-all at boarding - starting from the front rather than the back - so there is the inevitable bottleneck, and no clear instructions anyway. Again the flight crew think they're above helping with a bag. They're too busy to bring a meal mid-flight - for a child! Surliness, snootiness. Bad attitude. I thought United was bad. Delta is the worst. If I can avoid it, I'm not going back."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The flight was okay in general. However, staff service could be better and food could be highly improved. I go to Japan a lot and I'm used to stellar Japanese service, so I never had high hopes for service, but cabin crew were a little rude at times. I left a drink for them to collect and they were saying something like ""It seems like a waste"" and then took the drink. Not that I could finish it because it was right before landing. Very cold plane in my view. Seats were okay and IFE was okay. Dinner was regular but breakfast was terrible. The egg and sausage looked and tasted worse than a fast food restaurant. I could not get a return flight for a good price, and I don't know about other airlines, but when I changed my flight for a second time due to illness, they charged you 4k or more just for economy. No upgrades or anything. I ended up switching to another airline to get home. Again I was not too happy with Delta, but I wasn't expecting Japan-level service. Probably the best airline overall in terms of international travel in the USA."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I liked the check-in systems when I reached PHL. When I boarded the plane, I sat in Premium Economy. There was no IFE on the flight, so I passed the time by sleeping and enjoying the view. Scheduled flight time was 2 hrs 17 mins from PHL to ATL. Once I arrived in ATL we went on The Plane Train from Concourse A to Concourse T where my flight from ATL to DFW was departing from. Unfortunately, the flight was delayed. It was supposed to depart at 11.30am local time but delayed to 12.16pm. Therefore the flight arrival in DFW was also delayed, from 12.45pm local time to 1.26pm. Scheduled flight time was 2 hrs 45 mins."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I'm a loyal Diamond Delta customer that finds myself using United and other airlines of late. Delta has trimmed so many flights by day of week that I can't use them. Three weeks in a row I have gone elsewhere. Trying to book Detroit next week, a hub, and I can't because there are no seats. Delta Air Lines zeal to cut capacity means losing the loyalty of a very loyal customer."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flying on Delta's 757-200 on the Orlando - Detroit route is like flying in a coffin. This plane should be in the museum and not in the air. The plane is old. First class seats are ancient. Cabin is falling apart - the protective plexiglass window by my seat was cracked on the side. The service was dated. The red blanket given was made out of pure synthetics giving me so much static electricity. The only good part to the flight was that the breakfast wasn't all that bad. Besides all that, with a purchased first class ticket, we were not allowed to use their Sky Club lounge. Wasn't expecting much - but got even less than that."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We were notified 2 hours before our boarding time that our flight was cancelled and that we had been rebooked on a flight 5 hours later. After calling a Delta representative for an explanation she informed us that we had to talk to a ""Delta representative"" which required a 30 minute wait in the airport at their ""special services"" line. This representative told us there was nothing she could do. After waiting 7 hours in the airport we boarded our new flight and proceeded to sit at the terminal in a 90 degree full plane for 30 minutes as they worked on repairs to the plane. They attempted to connect exterior air conditioning to the plane but that unit was also not working. After 30 minutes they told us to grab our luggage and disboard. Currently still waiting at the gate 30 minutes after we were supposed to land in Portland. Never flying Delta again!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","First time flying Delta. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. Food was average. Cabin door closed on time, but waited about half an hour before we left the ground, still arrived on time. Overall the flight was better than average except for the seat. I was in premium economy and when you recline the seat back, the seat itself also moves forward. This initially seemed like a nice reclined position. However with no foot rest, this position created severe strain on my low back, and gave me a backache. I thought it was a fluke. However the same thing happened on the return flight. I loathe taking extra paraphenilia on a plane for ""flight comfort"" but you might need to consider lumbar support for long haul flights on this plane. On return to the US, I went through the immigration kiosk and my bags were on the carousel 5 minutes later."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was on a trip going to Miami from New York and the flight was delayed 3 hours. On my return it was delayed two hours. The food was not great, the seat comfort was horrible. The staff were very nice on the flight back. Overall the delays are unacceptable."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On both trips going up to Hartford out of Atlanta and coming back to Fort Myers from Atlanta we had no room for carry-ons, they had to be placed under our feet. Made for an uncomfortable trip and both times we spent more than 20 minutes waiting for luggage both going to Hartford and coming back from Hartford. I know they talk about 2500 miles if you wait more than 20 minutes for luggage but we haven't received any word on that. We've flown Delta in the past. But definitely will have second thoughts before using them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew with Delta from Chicago O'hare to Pisa via Detroit and Amsterdam. Between the big three American airlines (United, AA, and Delta), Delta would be my favorite. On all the flights they were organized, fast and on-time. From Chicago to Detroit, which was flown on a crj900, lasted only an hour but they still handed out snacks and drinks. On that flight my family and I were put in Comfort+ for no extra charge. Comfort+ had very nice legroom and very good seat width. The long haul flight from Detroit to Amsterdam was flown with a 767-400, which is in my opinion the nicest plane that Delta flies. With a 2-3-2 layout and me traveling in a party of 3 made it so we traveled in the middle section and were still undisturbed by an extra person next to us. It made the entire flight feel a whole lot more private. The IFE systems were great and had plenty of movies to watch. Were left on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This made it super easy to catch my connection. At Amsterdam we had plenty of time to relax and explore the airport. We had to fly with Transavia, one of the low-cost carriers linked with KLM, and that was slightly chaotic in boarding but comfortable inflight. We arrived on time and I'm impressed with the quality of Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Coming from Paris to Newark, the plane I was on had 2 out of 3 generators fail, so we had to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Newfoundland. We had to stay on the aircraft from 3pm until 11pm with malfunctioning air-conditioning and toilets. During this time we received one small cheese sandwich and a chocolate bar. The Delta Hub in Atlanta said they would send a plane, then after 3 hours of waiting, the pilot received word that it had not even taken off. When the 'rescue plane' finally arrived after everyone (260 approx) being in the plane for 8 hours, we sat on the rescue plane for another 50 minutes until we finally took off at 12.10am. I arrived at Newark to find my bag had been sent to Atlanta. Because of all of this I missed a connecting flight. I write this from Newark airport, still not reaching my destination of LA. This is not the first time I have had an issue with Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Had to connect at Detroit to Boston. Flight landed at Detroit around 2.55, for a 3.20 connection. Talked to the flight attendent, who assured us multiple times that we would be able to make it to our connection. We ended up being excessively late. I normally wouldn't be upset about something like this, but I have been on several flights where they let off people that needed to reach a connection quickly. There was an available solution and the employee failed to use it."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We arrived at JFK, checked in and promptly went through to the departure lounge. Bought our Duty/Tax free shopping, to be told we couldn't purchase it from that particular shop as we needed to go to a different terminal via bus. After a fiasco trying to find the lounge (building works going on and no clear notices), we'd walked the full length of the terminal to find our lounge had no Tim Horton's. Well it did, but it was in the domestic flight section, separated by a rope and we weren't allowed to duck under to get coffee so had to go all the way back to the far end of the terminal to get a coffee from Starbucks. That done, we went to find Duty/Tax free shop. When we asked a member of staff where the Duty free shop was, she smirked at us and said there wasn't one. Had I known this I'd have made my purchases prior to my flight to the States. Then we boarded our flight. The seats were ancient and everywhere appeared dirty. I'm 5'1 but was squashed into my seat which was lumpy and not comfortable at all. Dinner smelt like a cheap microwave meal and looked very unappealing. The staff weren't particularly helpful. My husband had medication to take, it took 3 attempts after requesting water for a glass to be brought to him."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We had an early morning departure from Boseman Montana, we were a large family and we got a very helpful Delta Airlines check in staff. The flight in itself was nice, both legs were short but I was more comfortable with the older 757-200 seats from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas but they were quite similar, since they were both short flights. There was no meal service but a choice of pretzels or nuts or biscuits and the attendants were allowing us to have more than one thing. All bags came through without issue and on time."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The original reservation was SJC–ATL–BCN. Delta later modified my outbound flight and added a SEA stop between SJC and ATL, which added several hours to an already long trip, and this is the low point of my experience. SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours, and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks, and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen, and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound, ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in, gate, and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights, as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCN–ATL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room, boarding priority, and premium drink, are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights. I'm a former frequent flyer of United and American airlines, who never handled their flight delays nearly as reasonably and promptly as Delta did."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Great airline! I booked with Virgin, but it turned out to be a codeshare. The IFE is considerably better than Virgin although the food wasn't as nice. I would gladly do it again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Excellent and friendly service with a smile from FA's. The Boeing 767 is the most comfortable aircraft flown by Delta as the seating is 2-3-2. I am able to sit next to my wife instead of sharing with a third person. Again, Delta continues to be a step above the other large airlines"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","This is my first flight with Delta. It will also be my last. The cost of the tickets was outrageous for a 2 hr flight but it was a present for my daughters so I reluctantly paid it because it had desirable departure times and no layovers. The flight was to leave at 9.35 am. They texted at 5 am to say the flight was delayed until 11.11. Just as I was walking out the door I noticed another text saying it was now going out at 12.15. As long as I had time I decided to check in online. There I was informed that my flight had been cancelled but 'don't worry, we've rebooked you on a different flight. Yes, one that leaves at 5.03 pm, lays over in Cleveland and doesn't arrive in NY until 10.00 pm. Wonderful, my daughters are already on their way to the airport, one having sat for an extra hour waiting due to the initial delay."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","It was my third flight with them this year. Quick flight from Winnipeg to Grand Rapids on July 17, and return on July 19. Smooth checking, boarding, clean aircrafts, on time departures and great service provided by ground and in flight personnel. Tickets a bit over priced, although at the same Delta provided great service. The only thing that could be improved are the snacks in economy."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I fly a lot with Delta ans was always happy but this is the first time I need to deal with customer service and I'm super disappointed. I ask a question and keep getting a standard response which you can see is taken from a general sheet 'how to answer questions' which does not fit my question at all. And I can't seem to get one contact and one email from anyone to answer. It's now going back and forth since 14 emails and 2 calls and I have not received a response as per why they did what they did. Very disappointing."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Got delayed from PAP, missed the connection and rerouted via MIA then ATL back to AMS. Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!), so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure. The Lost Luggage staff were very nice in fixing this quickly"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","This is not an acceptable C class. The seats feel short, the pitch is tight and you really can't recline much if you want to somewhat respectful of the person behind you. Service is basic, no cocktails, no nuts, a plate of just about edible dinner with a glass of undrinkable wine right after take off. Engine noise is deafening. Hard to believe that Delta is able to deliver credible premium service on other routes. On the plus side, the FAs were personable, the southbound itinerary is convenient and the flight ran on time."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We'd already flown Delta NYC to Nashville and were happy with it for shorter flights. However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying. Food was certainly no better than economy and fell short of Virgin Premium Economy which we flew out with. We chose Delta and the route because it had the best connections but next time we'll avoid Delta long haul."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was warmly greeted on entering the aircraft. The service was excellent, always with a smile. However, the cabin was very warm and noisy (we were seated over the engines). My wife had a window seat while I had a middle seat. EC is worth the money. I purchased a snack box which was just enough to keep away hunger pains, but nothing to brag about. The WI FI did not function until 2 hours into flight. However, Delta is certainly better than their competitors."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta is running a scam by calling this cabin first class. The seats, although slightly wider than in coach, do not recline, have no footrests, no phone or computer chargers. The leg room is only about 5 inches more than in coach. On my outbound flight, I had to pay for watching movies or television-any kind of television. The food is inedible. I've flown premium economy on other airlines (BA, Virgin Atlantic) that was much better than this."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","This the first time I have flown on Delta in 15 years, it was a short flight about three hours an early morning departure 6.50 am we arrived ahead of schedule, a very smooth flight with a very smooth landing. Our pre-order Muslim meal was delivered and it was a very filling and flavorful vegetarian sandwich. The cabin crew were very friendly and the entertainment system was very good. The seats left a lot to desire, a business class seat on flydubai was more comfortable which is a low cost airline, Delta need to look on upgrading these seats on their new orders from Airbus."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Got to the gate 2 hours early, while changing my seat number with the Delta rep she frivolously pointed out that the plane wasn't there yet and she had no idea why. Long story short our plane was scheduled for a routine engine change on account of reaching so many miles. No one in the tower or the boarding team was aware of this. No matter who's fault it was the point is they obviously can't communicate and manage the airline effectively. Pathetic customer is service - it consisted of blaming the tower and pushing back the departure time every 15 minutes with full confidence that it would leave then. Well, it didn't. Eventually they got a a new plane and it left 2.5 hours late. I had a connection flight that I missed as a result."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The Delta staff at Savannah Airport were so disgruntled, and the weather delays only caused the gate staff more confusion. Thanks to Delta, my wife and I have to sleep in a really nasty hotel room somewhere in nowhere Detroit because they were unwilling to help put us up for the night. Their advice was to take the Sky Miles packs and spend the night in the airport. Thanks for the toothbrush. Help with my luggage? Nope! We don't recommend trying to get your luggage off whatever belt it may have been diverted too. Help with a room? Nope. Take your travel kits and be on your way! Make a phone call to try to obtain help? Nope! Person on the other end of the line can't really speak very good English. $1200 got me stuck in Detroit on my way to Kansas City, in the nastiest room ever, without mine and my wife's medication because Delta take your money, but don't provide any quality of service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","BOS-CDG, overnight flight on the 11th July and code-shared with Air France. Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra £50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video. The food was adequate, although I wasn't a fan of the meagre breakfast. No complementary alcohol on a long-haul also struck me as a little stingy. Overall I'm pleased with my experience and would recommend Delta to others."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Booked Delta via UK agent over 3 months in advance, despite early booking we had no choice of seating, sat near back of plane, Delta customer service re moving forward no response until day of flight then lip service, leaking air valve overhead and uncomfortable hard seats. Same for return flight via JFK, worse still Delta charge for checked baggage for internal flight (rip-off) as paid in full for complete journey, over a $1000 each for economy. One lady only doing everything on both sides of plane, so long waits. Ear phones useless for films. Will book elsewhere in future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta suprised us-we selected this airline because of the width of the seats. We flew Sydney to Calgary via LAX and Seattle on the first leg and then coming home LAX to Sydney. Check-in staff (queues moved quickly) and customer service was excellent at all airports. Cabin staff were efficient and friendly - meals were reasonable. Entertainment system was okay - enough to keep us occupied on the long flights. Only issue we had was when one of our bags didn't arrive in Calgary - spoke to service desk and staff assured us that it would be found. The next day we arrived at Banff and the bag had been delivered before us - well done."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight was two hours late leaving, but once on board cabin crew were friendly, and each seat had individual IFE. Interior must have been recently upgraded, for a 767 it looked in fairly decent shape."

"Delta Air Lines customer review","Horrible experience. Left the gate in Norfolk late. Waited on the taxiway for 20 minutes prior to takeoff, allegedly due to a stoppage at Laguardia, the connecting city. One bathroom on the plane, which was dirty. Arrived at Laguardia a tad late, but not so late as to miss the connection. Then we sat on the taxiway at Laguardia for an hour because our gate was occupied, and missed our connection to Halifax. Now stuck in Laguardia from 11:30 am until 6:10 pm, arriving Nova Scotia at 9:30 pm. Half a day of vacation blown. Laguardia has nothing to do inside the airport. Delta refuses to comp anything. This was not a weather delay. We are traveling with a couple who are Delta premium members. They went to the customer service desk in the private Skyclub to try to get something in the way of a comp. No satisfaction. They asked for a supervisor, who refused to even come to the service desk. Delta doesn't give a damn about customer service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was scheduled to fly SEA-SFO-JFK. Flight to SFO was delayed by 30 minutes, which meant I would miss my connecting flight to JFK. I was notified by emaila phone call and through the app that my flight was delayed. Within one click of the app, I was offered alternate flights, even alternate dates and airports without any extra charge. I was then rebooked to the nonstop flight departing an hour later but two hours earlier than I originally would have arrived. The agent at the SkyClub upgraded me to an exit row seat free of charge and apologized for the delay, which was minimal in the first place. The delay was handled extremely smoothly and I was rebooked, upgraded and taken care off within five minutes. The actual flight was good, on board a Boeing 737-900ER and despite being only a year old, the cabin was not properly cleaned and there was garbage on the seats. Legroom was excellent as there was no seat in front of me, although it was a bit hard to see the television - it was about six feet away, although DL was smart enough to put a remote control for these seats. Complimentary beverage served multiple times and buy onboard food options were decent. Flight attendants did their job, were quite friendly. Entertainment options excellent, with entire seasons of my favorite TV shows. WiFi was fast, although I recommend buying the 24-hour pass on the DL website or app as it's much more expensive onboard. Overall, a pleasant experience onboard but DL did a fantastic job handling the delay on the ground."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Be warned. Purchasing a first class ticket does not allow you to use the Delta lounge Boston airport. There are a number of exclusions that were not disclosed when the ticket was purchased. This is the first time I have encountered this. Disappointed and very unlikely to travel with Delta Air Lines again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was flying out on vacation with my husband and 2 children. Our flight was supposed to leave on June 24 at 6.05am with a connection in JFK at 9.10am. Our first flight was delayed due to the weather from the previous night. They told us that the plane was not able to complete its full route to Philly and had to stay in Baltimore because of the rain the night before. We were told that the plane was supposed to arrive to Philly airport around 8am, making its departure to JFK at 8.40am. After waiting for 3 hrs, they started delaying the flight every 20 mins until finally we were able to board at 10.40am, making us miss our connecting flight to the Dominican Republic. Before leaving Philly they rebooked our connecting flight to 2pm. After getting to JFK and almost ready to board the next flight, they said that the plane had some mechanical problem and the flight was delayed 2 hrs, when finally we were about to board that plane, we were told that we were not booked for that flight even though we had seats numbers. They sent us to customer service where they wanted to rebook our flight for the following day with no accommodation, I argued and they put us on the following flight that night at 10.30pm. After boarding this flight they made us wait inside the plane for about an hour before leaving. After almost 24 hours of delays and waiting we finally got to our destination at 3.30 in the morning. Our baggage did not arrive on the same flight. Its a shame how unorganized Delta has become."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","AUS-LAX-SEA. I usually fly economy but decided to spring for first class as my traveling companion had never flown in that cabin before. It was nice to check bags with no fees! Boarding was efficient in AUS and it was a nice touch to be addressed by name. Boarding efficient and flight left on time. It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class. The wrap and accompaniments were fresh and delicious. Drinks flowed and attendants were offered snacks and checked on customer needs. I had heard and Delta and its regional partners have worked to improve service and food and I was not disappointed."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The terminal in SEA was unbelievably chaotic as it was a mix of overseas, Hawaii and cross country flights. There was very little seating and the place was cramped. Good thing we only had to be there for an hour. The SEA to MSP leg was on an older 767 with upgraded interior. This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets. I imagine it is easy to overlook the seat pockets as fast as they have to turn the plane around but I still think an extra minute or two and it could easily be taken care of."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Comfort plus is nearly worth the upgrade fee - seat is still poor but leg room is good. Baggage delayed by more than 48 hours with the most insincere of apologies from the online folks. The staff, however, were great."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I had a great trip from JFK to FCO. Comfortable seats, good food and a decent amount of legroom. Cabin staff were quite helpful, they provided lots of information about flight time, weather, traffic, and delay since there was a large amount of rain before my flight. Will fly with Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew on this airline while on vacation in the USA. We were going from San Francisco to West Palm Beach via Atlanta. We first went from San Francisco to Atlanta and the staff were good. The plane had touch screens but some didn't work properly but were OK. The snacks were good especially the cookies. We reach Atlanta early so were in time for our next flight for West Palm Beach. The next flight was also good. The flight was short. Overall a very good airline."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The TV, music and wifi service was not working. When we landed, we sat on the Tarmac for 45 minutes with the smell of jet fuel in the cabin. It was a horribly long and uncomfortable wait that made us late"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On the way to Key West our plane was delayed 3 hours. They delayed it after we had boarded, so we had to stay in the hot airplane with no air conditioning. We were told our best option was to check our bags because there wasn't much room on board. They told us our bags would reach our final destination. When we arrived in Key West mine, nor my families bags were on the carousel. We were told they were still sitting at Atlanta airport. We finally got them the next day. Flying back we also had a delay for 2 hours for no reason. We were not allowed to exit the plane. Flying with Delta was the worst experience I have encountered."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The first flight was running 45 min behind for what Delta staff said was ""no reason why"". Then in Atlanta we ran to catch the other flight arriving early still to board. We were told that our seats had been given away. We explained we were early and there was no reason given why our seats were given away. We found out the flight was 55 people overbooked. We were told we could wait in the aireport until we could get another flight. This happened over and over to others too. We finally got the flight out of ATL on Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I started this trip on Wednesday July 1 from Raleigh North Carolina. The flight was delayed from leaving there to come to Atlanta and I missed my connect flight to Brazil. We final get to the Atlanta airport to find out we couldn't leave until 7pm on July 2. We were stuck at airport until then. We try to check in July 2 for 7 pm fight to find out that Delta did not rebook our flights the way they confirmed they had. They did fix that so we wait till 7pm for our plane out. Well after waiting for hours and hours we board out going plane. Then after 30 min on plane they tell us there is a problem with the plane mechanics, so we un board the plane and wait. Delay after delay, then at 11 pm we are allowed to board the plane again only to be told after 20 min the flight was delayed till 8 am on July 3! There was not offer for help or compensation of an sort."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Prior to the trip, I chose the seat 15ABC on the first leg and 19ABC on the latter leg for my family. At HKG, I was told that all of us has been upgraded to Business Elite on both flights, 1A2A3A and 2ACD. It was a great experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from Atlanta to Los Angeles in order to connect with Air New Zealand to Auckland. I selected the economy comfort seats and found them to be very nice and the legroom more than I expected. What was interesting how the cabin was separated though not with a divider so it felt very exclusive. In addition, there was a blanket and headset for watching the back seat TV. We received other snacks as well as the other normal offerings. One thing that can be said is Delta is trying to improve its service and the fact that they still offer some type of snack with your drink is better than what you get from American and United."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The flight was delayed. The boarding process was unorganized and a complete mess. We were the last ones to board and by the time we got to the entrance, my bag was automatically taken to be sent with the rest of the cargo because the flight was full and there was no space. When I check the cabins inside, I saw spaces available. The crew/staff didn't even check to see if there was space which proves how unprofessional this airline is. I paid for my ticket and only brought this bag. The crew were also unprofessional and tried to argue the fact that once the bag is checked that there was nothing for them to do and that's how things are. I guess poor food and delayed flights are not the only things that best described the service and reputation of Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Many people have had negative reviews about Delta domestic flights. I had no problem with them. Compared to International airlines I've flown they don't come close. But for domestic they were superb. Great FA's, clean plane, and on time service. The seats aren't too bad, and the inflight entertainment system was pretty good. Overall a nice flight and I would choose them again if I had the chance."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I often read negative reviews of Delta. I for one have found them to be by far the best of the legacy carriers. I always find the staff helpful and pleasant, both ground and cabin staff. My recent flight had a routing DSM/MSP/JFK/LHR. On arrival at MSP I realized that my connecting flight to JFK was delayed, making the JFK connection impossible. When I explained my dilemma to a very helpful Delta employee in the Delta Club room she immediately worked on getting both me and my luggage onto the MSP/LHR service. An ontime boarding took place and I was greeted with a smile by the cabin services manager. Once airborne dinner was served (a very reasonable meal) promptly allowing the maximum time for sleep. We arrived into LHR on time and I cleared immigration and customs in a little over 30 minutes from touchdown. Delta had done for me exactly what I had asked from them, a safe, pleasant, on time journey. All the staff that I encountered during this trip were friendly and responded positively to my needs. What more could I have asked for?"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","San Diego to ATL on June 30. Started with the airline offering free pizza in the gate area. Boarded the 737-900 and flight crews standing throughout the plane welcomed passengers with a pleasant greeting. Economy comfort seat was great with the extra legroom, would not have wanted to be in a regular economy seat for the 4 hour flight. Took off on time, good games, movies, TV shows on the large seatback screens. Flight crew stayed busy the whole time serving snacks and drinks with 2 or 3 runs at least. Landed in Atlanta on time in spite of the not so great weather. No complaints, I would recommend!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","After purchasing a ticket for my 14 year old son months in advance, I was very upset after arriving at Orlando International Airport at 4am to be told there would be am additional $150 fee for him. No where when I purchased the ticket did it tell me I'd be charged at the airport, wouldn't you think they would have charged me upfront when I paid for the ticket? If that wasn't bad enough I was told that because of the short period if time before the aircraft was due to depart, 1 hr, if he didn't make the flight there would be an additional $50 fee to get him on the next flight. We were at the airport at 3.30am, not my fault that Delta's counters don't open until 4am. It's bad enough that Delta is one of the more expensive airlines that doesn't offer free WiFi, but the agents at the counter were rude and unsympathetic."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from YYC-ATL, with a stop in Salt Lake City. Check in was very slow and the person behind the desk was very rude. Our flight to Salt Lake City was 2 hours late. The seats were very uncomfortable, they were very hard and had little cushioning. The flight attendants were all rude and glared at you every time you had a request. The bathrooms were some of the filthiest I have experienced. Salt Lake City Airport was dirty and confusing, we had 55 minutes to make our connecting flight and nearly missed it because of the long time it took to change terminals. The flight from Salt Lake City to Atlanta was the same."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We started out in Boston. Our flight was delayed an hour which was no ones fault. It was because of weather. However after we boarded the plane the isles was full of passengers with carry on's and no room in overhead bins. Flight Attendant created confusion trying to rush us in our seats. They took all 4 of my family's bags and rudely told us they would arrive in SLC our final destination. A diff Attendant handed me 2 baggage labels. I started to ask why 2 instead of 4 and ignored me and rushed up the isle. Because of delay we missed our connection. The Delta staff at JFK were horrible! Very short and acted annoyed that they had to give us directions to catch the new later connection. We arrived at the new gate to more Very rude Delta staff. Our tickets said not assigned so I stood in line at the gate to find out our new seats. When I approached the Delta staff I was told to sit down she was working on assigning seats (several passengers missed the connection). I tried to request that seats together because we were traveling with children on a 5 hour flight. She firmly told me to sit down. I felt like an idiot. They put us on the very back row with seats that partially reclined. Let's just say it was a long 5hours. After arriving in SLC 3hours later at midnight, only 3 out of the 4 bags that the rushing flight attendant took from us in the aisle arrived. Went to bag help and another employee who said he could only take a report because they didn't have record that they checked 4 bags only 2 - Delta did give us a 1888 number to call. Avoid flying Delta at all cost."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta/Air France to and from Paris and both times our Delta flight was a problem. On the way out they bumped us from Comfort to Economy with no notice and put me in a middle seat when we had requested 2 aisles. A nice customer service person went into our reservation and could see that we had been bumped but had no idea why. On the way back Delta had no record of our reservation but since we had proof they managed to squeeze us onto the plane after trying to get us to take one 2 hours later. Needless to say we didn't get Comfort on that leg. We were told we would get a refund on our credit card but so far nothing. Luckily we saved everything and have printed tickets, not an eticket."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On June 23rd Delta cancelled our layover flight home to Calgary. They gave 1 hour notice and could only rebook our flight 20 hrs later. Our flight was marked as mechanical problems and Delta advised customers that we had to provide our own hotel room since they ""ran out of hotels due to multiple flights cancelled that day"". After being on the phone with several agents and talking to associates at the airport we were advised to find our own hotel and submit it to Delta for possible reimbursement. The next day I spoke to a supervisor and she informed me that Delta airlines does not issue reimbursements and she could only give it in a form of a travel voucher for our next flight. I then phoned their customer care team and they told me the same thing only instead they could offer me an iTunes gift card."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Aircraft a bit old but cabin crew were friendly and extremely helpful. A pleasant trip following a long haul from Sydney. The pre-flight safety brief was hilarious and a great attention grabber. Wish more airlines were as imaginative. Had heard some differing views about this airline but we were very pleasantly surprised."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DCA-MSP flight went smoothly. Smooth connection at MSP. MSP-NRT flight has many pros and cons. The seat was very comforatable compared to other airlines combined with a satisfactory IFE. The food could be much much better. I had chicken teriyaki for my supper and that was acceptable, but breakfast was horrible. The appearance was bad enough, the egg looking like a wet sponge without any air pockets and the sausage was burnt. But the taste was even worse. The fruit was acceptable. To end on a good note, the arrival at NRT went very well and smoothly."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I made a reservation with Delta airlines in April 2015 for travel in July. I am a single father traveling with two small children (ages 6 and 10) and booked far in advance and in First class so that I could sit with my children. I was informed 24 hours ago that our seats had been changed and that I would not be seated with my children. When I called Delta to inquire (and after waiting more than 2 hours to speak to a representative) I was told there was nothing that they could do and that my children would have to sit by themselves. Despite the obvious safety concerns, there is no way that I can assist my children with beverages or bathroom breaks if needed. If you are a single parent, do not fly Delta. Not family friendly."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Had a pretty good experience with Delta. Had 5 persons in my party, 2 of which with lap children. We were in basic economy on the way to Tampa. The only complaint we had on the way out to Tampa was the crew weren't happy. On the flight back we upgraded our 3 seats to Comfort Plus which was much better. More leg room, better snacks and free alcohol. The flight crew was cheery and up beat making the flight easier."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Left Minneapolis RT to San Jose in June. First Class RT paid ticket. On the flight out we were served a full breakfast. The food was actually not bad. Flight attendant was very attentive and quiet busy checking on all passengers. Did not disappear after the meal service. The flight back to Minneapolis was also excellent. Boarding was orderly in both directions. Lunch was a large salad. However, only one choice. It was a Salmon Salad. Quite a few of passengers turned it down, including me. I was surprised there were not at least 2 choices. Once again First class FA was great. Waiting to board in both directions, the checked baggage and the number of carry on is being abused. in both directions. People were checking bags that were huge. Not sure how they got past TSA. Gate Agents need to enforce bag sizes and the number of bags people try to drag on."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I took my second trip with Delta and I must say I was definitely not disappointed. I flew with Delta last year and felt there was no need to change to a different airline. I flew from Indy to Phoenix via Minneapolis. The crews both at the gate and during the flight were professional and respectful. The big two thumbs I want to give is on my luggage in Phoenix. No sooner had I walked off the plane and down to the baggage claim carousel was I greeted by my bag arriving. Only thing I found average was the seat comfort, but granted I have never really cared about seat comfort."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","For a short haul flight like this one (7-8 hours each way), I try and save money by not booking business class, rather ""economy comfort"" on Delta. As usual, the service is perfunctory, the food not bad in and out of Narita, the seat fairly comfortable, and the entertainment of good quality with lots of choices. No drama on either flight. My only complaint that has never been addressed properly with Delta over the years is the horrible state of the lavatories. They are always left to fester for entire flights. I have never once seen an FA go in one to clean one. Delta is not ""special"" compared to other international carriers, but it's adequate and they have treated me well in the Skymiles program so far."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Check in procedure was ok but slow. The flight was nice, with very good in-flight entertainment, and the flight attendants were very nice. The food wasn't great - but not the worst. The seats are comfortable and I had plenty of leg room."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Brussels to JFK. Horrible check-in procedure. Unable to check in online, then checked in at airport but without assigned seat. Result: sitting separate from my boyfriend while I am afraid to fly. At check in counter not very helpful, lady (though friendly) said she couldn't do anything and that we had to wait until boarding. At gate itself they're trying to get us to sit next to each other but difficulties since flight is fully booked. Not impressed with customer service and we were not informed by email, when booking, or at check-in that there were paid seats as an option and that the free seats were given away and that is why we were assigned no seat number."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta will always be my first choice across the Atlantic and I have found them to be always even better than either BA or Virgin (who have themselves always provided excellent service). My latest flights were no exception. This is the second time I've flown from Heathrow to LAX in four months and both times the service has been great. Without doubt the friendliest cabin crew I have met the in-flight entertainment was good the food was okay and plentiful and the drinks and snacks kept coming. My first choice every time and whilst not the cheapest carrier it's certainly been the most reliable and pleasant to fly with."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","5/28/15 PVD-ATL-CAE 6/1/15 CAE-ATL-PVD. Flight was on time departing PVD. Had booked Economy+ and was lucky enough to have an empty middle seat. Got a free cocktail in Economy+. Unfortunately passengers ignore the signs that say bin space over those seats is reserved for Economy+ because when I boarded I had to use a bin 4 rows back which is annoying when deplaning. Got delayed about 25 minutes by weather before landing at ATL. Had to go straight to the gate for the next flight. Staff was very pleasant. ATL to CAE is less than 30 mins so there is no beverage service. Arrived at CAE about 50 mins before my scheduled flight from CAE to LGA. Got a text saying it was delayed 45 mins. I knew I would never make the connection to BOS. There was a flight boarding to ATL and I asked if they could get me there faster. They said they couldn't get me to BOS earlier but they could get me to PVD. They gave me a seat (and happily changed it when I asked for an aisle). No beverage service. CAE to ATL is killer at 7am! No Starbucks in Terminal C at ATL. Flight to PVD arrived 20 mins early and flight attendants were very pleasant."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK to LAX. We were apprehensive about flying Delta but got a good price on this mid afternoon flight. Bought Delta comfort to see if this improved the experience. Flight left on time. Seats were ok food poor but attendants were friendly and aircraft wasn't in as bad a condition as we had expected. Overall an ok experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","$600 for the less than 2 hour flight 1377 (PHL-RDW) booked 2 weeks in advance was daylight robbery. The 30 minute line at the baggage drop caused entirely by staff shortage added insult to injury. But never mind the flight was delayed by over an hour anyway."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have chosen Delta for years because of it was the best one but lately it's service has been so terrible that I will never fly with them again. Twice now I have flown out of Detroit and there have been problems that have delayed the flight to our next location (I understand that problems happen) but while we were on our flight I was very thirsty and asked the stewardess for a glass of water and she said the cart would be by shortly - the cart skipped our whole section and when I tried to stop the flight attendant again I was ignored - I didn't see the attendants for the rest of the flight. When we arrived at Atlanta to switch to our next flight we had missed our flight. The first time no one would help me - I must have talked to at least 10 people before finding someone that rudely told me to go to a certain gate and wait and that I might make it onto that flight. This time I went to the gate and they told us the plane had just left (the plane was not suppose to leave Atlanta until 12.50 I was at the gate at 12.40) and when I asked where do I go to get another flight I was ignored and they walked away. I then went to the information and was told to go to a gate that had no one at it - no one! I then went back and was rudely sent to another gate where I was told they didn't know if they had a seat available for me. After an hour I was able to get a flight home. I could not believe the rudeness that I was treated with."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My wife and I were booked on Delta flight 7 leaving Dubai at 9.45 pm. There was a mechanical problem with the plane these things happen. We were advised to go wait in a nearby Business Class lounge and wait for an announcement which never occurred. I walked back to the gate only to then discover that the flight had been cancelled and no announcement had been made the gate agent even admitted this. The rebooking was a nightmare we finally left Dubai two days later and had to endure the same rude gate agents who were more concerned with talking on their cell phones and playing around than taking care of the customers. Most of the agents did not speak even a small amount of English they were not organized and clearly not professionals. I have flown with Delta for over 11 years this is the worst experience I have ever had."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Worst airline I have ever flown. We are frequent flyers and this was a trip from hell. We will never fly Delta again. We were traveling from LAX to Dublin with a change of planes in N.Y. We sat in the plane on the ground for 2 hours at L.A.X. because of mechanical problems. Because of this we missed our connection to Dublin so had to spend the night in N.Y. From N.Y. They flew us to Atlanta the next day. Again there was airplane problems. We waited for two hours at the airport for them to find a plane that worked. It took us two days to get to Dublin. On the way home we flew from Dublin to N.Y. again sat on ground for 2 hours and 15 minutes on the Tarmac. Once we arrived back at LAX waited another hour in baggage claim only to find that our one bag was put on another flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have lay flat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that lay flat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It compromised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class. My view is that one should avoid Delta at all costs."

"Delta Air Lines customer review","PDX-MSP-DCA-MSP-DCA: Clean aircraft's (B757 A320 MD90 B737-800). No IFE on the inbound flights but because I had a tablet I just connected to their wifi (without paying) and go to Delta Studio allowing me to stream movies for free. On the return flight the B737-800 was newly refurbished and had IFE with some good choice of videos. Snacks (to be purchased) are as usual awful. Flight crew polite and professional except the on the MSP-PDX leg where two flight attendants were more preoccupied by taking breaks than serving beverage in a professional manner. No delays on all segments."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Looked forward to Delta Comfort on recent flight from DFW to Minn. Delta changed planes so there was no Delta Comfort. I was relegated to a window seat. Delta could not get their act together on reassigning seats so the boarding process was terribly slow and disorganized. I fly Delta to Minn because I have to not because I want to. I don't think American's customer service or organization is great but it's better than this. If you can use another airline."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Honolulu - Narita Business. A very pleasant experience. Very comfortable private seat excellent entertainment and very good food on this nearly eight hour flight. Cabin crew could have been warmer but otherwise did an excellent attentive job. On time arrival speedy baggage delivery all added up to a very positive travel day."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL2311 on May 2nd 2015. JFK-MIA lounge with very poor. Some snacks some drinks but you have to pay if you want by example a bottle beer. Flight was packed in first class Boeing 717 in fact a DC9 which showed its age. First class is a real joke."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We could have driven From Louisville to Portland ME quicker than Delta was able to get us there after they had a plane changed at a gate in SDF due to a ""bathroom"" issue and difficulty finding the flight crew that apparently wandered off and could not be found for a while."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","5/0/15 PHL-SLC Airbus A320. Flight similar to the ones I took on 5/4/15. Economy comfort is better than economy but not by much. Its main advantage is priority boarding which allows me to avoid the inevitable rush and scramble for overhead bin space. Rated food as 1 because I didn't buy any entertainment also as 1 because there wasn't any. I don't look forward to flying with Delta even in economy comfort."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","5/4/15 MSP-PHL MD 90. Rated food as a 1 because the inflight offerings do not appeal to me. When I've tried to purchase food items on previous flights the FAs have run out of the items I would have ordered. So I brought my own sandwich. I also brought my own beverage because FAs on a previous flight refused to sell me a bottle of wine for dinner told me to wait for the beverage cart's second round. Rated entertainment as 1 because there was none. The FAs were competent the aircraft clean and on time."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","5/4/15 SMF-MSP Airbus A320 Economy Comfort legroom adequate service competent. Complaint: Delta does not post economy comfort fares on its website but as separate upgrades for each flight segment. Value for money rated at 1 because I traveled on an award ticket entertainment rated as 1 because the flight didn't have any. Legroom was slightly better than on previous Economy Comfort flights but recline was still minimal. Food for purchase was unappealing but the complimentary snacks and beverages were acceptable. I wouldn't recommend Delta because it seems to focus more on nickel and diming its passengers than in providing quality service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","A simple flight from BWI to NYC turned into a 3 hour wait on flight 3371. With very little communication between the staff/pilot and the passengers. On a bright sunny day in MD and only mild rain and overcast in NYC the pilot said it was weather related. After waiting for the plane to arrive for 2.5 hours. When we get on the flight we had to wait another 30 minutes on the plane for more ridiculous reasons - they claim the baggage door was not shut properly. So someone comes to shut it and then we go out to runway. Then we have to wait another 13 minutes. Not able to rebook me for reasons that were also very vague. The flight was overpriced and didn't event accomplish it's intended purpose to get people where they need to be on time. As a business traveller this is absolutely unacceptable. I cannot get business done if I can't get to my destination."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","5/9/15 SLC-SMF Airbus A320. My spouse let me sit in her first class seat. It was a disappointment: legroom not much better than Economy Comfort although the seat was wider and had more recline. The food was also disappointing same snacks as the ones given to Economy Comfort passengers. On the positive side the FA brought me a glass of wine when requested unlike my main cabin experiences in which FAs will not bring me a small bottle for wine (even if purchased) until the beverage cart makes its rounds. I didn't pay for this first class travel but if I had I would have been even more disappointed. My trip satisfaction is less than it was for my Economy Comfort flights because first class failed to meet my expectations. I rated entertainment as 1 because there wasn't any."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LAX-JFK-KEF return Comfort + on all four segments. The Sky Priority boarding and extra legroom were a real plus but the DL Comfort + seating does not compare to BA Premium Economy. The Levo wraps and frozen yoghurt bars on the two transcontinental flights were 100 times better than the coach dinner and lunch served on the two international segments. Appreciated the open bar on all four flights but not the wine from a box on JFK-KEF. The cabin crews were friendly and professional on all four flights and there was no wait for luggage in either KEF or LAX. The ancient 767 on the final JFK-LAX leg was too warm had poor ventilation and the VOD lacked the live Dish TV option. Boarding for JFK-LAX was chaotic."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DL1162 LAX-JFK on 05/11. We were booked on this flight after missing connecting QF flight from MEL. I was seated in an aisle seat next to the emergency exit plenty of legroom possibly the most comfortable seat I've been on (having only flown economy). The snacks and drinks were fine the cabin crew were attentive. However it is simply wrong that you cannot use the entertainment system during take-off and landing. Overall quite average service nothing particularly bad however I still would prefer QF if I had the choice."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On 28 April 2015 my friend and I travelled from Fort Lauderdale Florida to Atlanta Georgia for our connecting flight to Manchester England UK. Due to storms in Florida our flight was delayed by an hour. Despite the pilot's best efforts we arrived at Atlanta B24 35 mins before our flight to England was due to take off. After running as fast as we could we arrived at the check-in desk 10 mins before the Virgin plane was due to depart (the airline was aware of the Florida delay). Despite the best efforts of all the personnel on duty they were unable to get us on the plane. Nevertheless not only did the staff stay with us to locate our baggage at B24 but tried and succeeded to get us on another plane to depart that night. Staff not only located our baggage but ensured it would be put on the new flight. To the lady who got us two seats on the Delta flight to Manchester via Amsterdam and the staff member accompanied us to E30 to make sure we were checked in and on our way home."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Milwaukee WI to Atlanta GA - Panama City FL return. My mother and I traveled with a connecting flight in Atlanta. We requested wheelchair assistance ahead of time. We were met at every plane with the wheelchair and a very courteous staff member."

"Delta Air Lines customer review","Travelled from DUB-ATL-RSW on 22nd April 2015. Very good service from any Delta employee either check in or flight crew we had contact with. My wife and myself travel from DUB 3 or 4 times a year always with Delta to enjoy the Florida sunshine. We do on occasions treat ourselves to a trip up front and to a degree we are looking forward to the trip already booked for the end of Sept when we are using some of my wife's miles to upgrade. Everybody today worked well and provided a very good service on both flights and I would have no problem at all about saying that the Delta workers represented their company very well."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We flew to Phoenix from Montreal with a Detroit connection and cannot believe what is passing for a decent airline experience in the US these days (the return on American Airlines was just as bad). The least passengers should expect from an airline is a seat that is not torn and filthy a plane that leaves on time and that arrives on one piece. Fine the flight did those things but are we supposed to be impressed? The plane was packed and tiny. No room for hand luggage for many passengers. Old plane - I mean really old. No movies or Ipads. Somewhat encouraged by the Wifi on board until we discovered you had to pay for it and it did not work well anyway. Business class looked like economy class five to seven years ago. Seats were small and do not get me started on the pitch. Dilapidated and depressing two other words starting with ""D"". Delta needs a makeover. I have new insight into why Air Canada is rated the best airline in North America. The bar is so very low."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Travelled from London Heathrow to Los Angeles in early April 2015. From the time of check-in the Delta staff were nothing but extremely helpful and obliging making the process super quick and easy. The flight itself was fantastic - unlimited drinks/alcohol (I had three very generous servings of red wine) and ample food. Hot towels were handed out at the beginning and end of the service while two meals were served during the 11-hour flight. If we required more drinks or food the staff were more than happy to oblige. The in-flight entertainment was also top notch - wonderfully wide selection of television shows and films. All in all a very pleasant experience - can't say the same for the subsequent LA > Vegas leg of the journey so will be sticking with Delta for intercontinental flights!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL 449 BOG-JFK business class. Awful Avianca lounge in BOG crowded and rude staffed. The aircraft was a 1980- vintage B757 unbelievable! Flight left 35 minutes late with no explanations. Although skypriority boarding was smooth the welcome sparkling wine was warm. No peanuts not even a napkin. Refills were offered by the rather friendly and respectful crew. Nice two course dinner with fair wine offer. Overall a nice experience which was ruined on the return JFK-BOG leg."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Return flight JFK-BOG business class. Awful dirty DL Skyclub at terminal 4 wherein all drinks and food have to be paid for except for mediocre house wines warm domestic beers and yes popcorn. Flight left 30 minutes late. Rude disinterested crew barely greeted the boarding passengers. Same ancient 757 with fairly comfortable lie flat seating. Were served an awful breakfast at midnight instead of dinner with no explanations. Then crew gathered in the front galley screaming and laughing bothering paying J class passengers that were trying to sleep. One of the pilots occupied seat 1A beside me without even saying hello. Unbelievable. Finally the crew forgot customs forms to entry BOG they didn't even knew they existed so we had to get them upon arrival. Luggage arrived one hour after arrival. Never again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Shanghai Pudong-Tokyo Narita on old B767-300ER return on A330-300 both on time check-in/boarding very efficient lounge at Pudong Airport run by China Eastern which is always bad nothing to eat and over-crowded. Inflight food and drinks good considering it's a 2hr regional flight crew very polite and friendly. AVOD is amazing with lots latest movies."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","First time with Delta and very pleased with the result. Seat on the 767 worked fine if slowly and the flat bed was comfortable. This was enhanced by the excellent Westin pillow and duvet. The most comfortable pillow of any airline I have flown with. Food was excellent well presented and flavourful. Cabin crew were pleasant attentive and polite. The only bad thing I can report was the IFE system. It took five or maybe six attempts to make it work and the selection of movies was extremely limited. The small screen was not of great quality either. Flight was on time."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew Business on an international flight aboard 767-300. The experience in the Business class is probably one of the worst due to the layout of the cabin. The Galley is in the front and in order for the flight attendants to service the plane down to the middle of the standard economy class they must go through the Business class cabin to reach the areas to the back. On other airlines such as ANA they have an extra Galley behind the Business and Premium Economy class seats so that there may be a separation in service and noise. The design of the seating arrangement in the Business class is much tighter in the Delta with its bulky boxy full-flat system that the flight attendants' hard foot steps with their high-heels can be felt bouncing through the walls of the full-flat system. What kind of flooring did they use in the aisle? Why do the horrible footsteps and cart sounds transmit so much to the boxy seat system? I could not rest quietly or comfortably as the massive loud obnoxious footsteps of passengers and flight attendants alike can be felt all throughout the flight. No courtesy there obviously no company policy there obviously to make the flight attendants wear something more quiet on their feet or to be more considerate when running down the aisle! The temperature control of the full-flat system is lacking. The seats themselves feel fine but they become very hot after a while and there is no air around the seat or your feet so there is no way to cool down. The attitude of the flight attendants is about what you would expect from a classless American transport company fairly lacking in manners and they treat you as if you're on a flying bus (as they have always done). The Flight Safety video is a joke as they intended it to be but it certainly doesn't make anybody feel safe as nobody remembers the actual safety bits but remembers the comedy bits! A total waste of time and energy and most certainly conveys what I said earlier about the attitude of the airline. It feels like a cheap low-class flying commuter bus service and they'll treat you like that."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away. It turned out the name confusion was an issue again. I will never fly Delta again if I can possibly avoid it."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK-NRT-SIN And back. Sky club at JFK was nice but wish food didn't need to be paid for. First flight was largely uneventful the seats were what I expected food was nothing special and IFE was great. The lounge in NRT though needs an upgrade in terms of F&B. A lot of other airlines have more than just small bowls of whatever they're serving. (At least there were showers). NRT-SIN was normal and like the previous flight. The return was similar aside from the fact that Delta actually listened to customer feedback and pushed the departure time from 6 to 7am. Not too thrilled that the arrival into JFK is when a bunch of others come in and result in a 2 hour wait at immigration."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I arrived at the airport around 8.50 for a 10.15 flight. I was on military orders. They delayed my flight and/or switched my flight 10 times. Put me on Standby on 3 different flights. They gave no preference or concern. I called to talk to customer service and they did nothing. During my flight from Jacksonville to Atlanta they didn't even serve food or drinks because they said they ran out of time. I could have driven from Jacksonville to Norfolk faster. I was in the airport for 14 hours. That is unacceptable and the staff won't tell you if you made standby or not so you have to wait there instead of getting food or leave the area."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK to LHR possibly the worst flight and service I have experienced. The cabin crew made it clear that passengers were especially economy were a real inconvenience - the customer service was awful food and beverages dumped on trays and very little interest in the passengers. There was no excuse everyone was polite to the cabin staff and if anything had kicked off it would have been as a result of their rudeness and failure to pay attention. Economy doesn't mean cheap had I been travelling alone I would have travel business but as I was with a group I stayed with them. Compared to Virgin Atlantic and BA Delta is a waste of money will always change the flight or choose another carrier in future once was too much."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DL from Brussels to Sacramento CA. It turned out to be a really good trip. All flights were on time and connections went smooth. Both ground and inflight staff were very professional and friendly. The special meal I ordered was fine. I would definitely recommend this airline!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from BNA-ATL-EYW round trip for spring break. Full planes no upgrades available. Its nice to take a full size plane into Key West. All four flight segments were nice clean comfortable. Seat was tight but its coach and no flight was over 1.5 hours. Flight attendants were competent and pleasant on all legs. Loved the gate crew at Key West campy and competent. Made everyone laugh. Easiest way to Key West in my opinion. It wasn't cheap and my Frequent Flyer miles were no good for a First Class upgrade but I didn't mind a single bit."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LHR-JFK 29th March 2015 - B767-400 - Boarding was slow at Heathrow but very organised we had a basic economy seat on our outbound sector and I've never seen Seats so small my partner is 6ft 6 and could not fit in the seats and although everyone is entitled to someone even had the audacity to recline their seat in front of him knowing he couldn't fit. Flight was full but the services offered were very good and efficient we were offered a complimentary meal and a snack during the flight along with beverages. Flight attendants were very nice and polite however a couple of them were miserable and rude and towards the end of flight they lost interest and almost threw the coffee at us. We were happy to get off the flight it was very uncomfortable. JFK-LHR B767-300 - Our inbound sector was much better we paid to upgrade into economy comfort with exits seats which also meant priority boarding. Seats were not the greatest but legroom was huge and better for my partner. Flight was a night flight and it was very quiet and almost empty flight attendants polite and services offered again were very good. Both aircraft each way were ageing but at least they got us to our destination. I noticed Call bells were not answered and were left for hours. In flight entertainment was good new films offered for free along with games and TV shows. I would recommend Delta but next time would definitely pay to upgrade both ways due to the seat pitch in basic economy."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Economy Nice Côte d'Azur to JFK 4th April 2015. Flight was about an hour delayed to leave Nice airport but Delta gave all passengers complimentary pizza and drinks as an apology for the wait (even though I had received an email about the delay several hours before). Boarding took forever as the mandatory checks have become very long and tedious (my carry on bags were opened for a second time right before I boarded the plane although this was randomized from what I understand). The plane floors and loos were quite dirty as if a thorough cleaning had not been done in a while. Very limited food choices although staff helpful with snacks. Other than above (oh and the horrendous immigration queues at JFK) everything else was great."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL28 Atlanta-Heathrow 16/3/15. Party of 4. Paid $99 upgrade to premium economy (drinks and seating package). We were offered 2 drinks and noticed all economy passengers were offered same FOC. There was little or no discernible difference between our seats and other seats in economy cabin. We were given the wrong food which was awful. The video equipment failed and it took almost 1 hr. to effect a reset. Hostess never did respond to call had to walk up the plane to report video and food issues. Generally a ""could not be bothered"" attitude."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Business from BOS to AMS in late February. The newly configured Business cabin on the A330 is now my favorite on any airline or any plane. Very comfortable seat/lie flat bed and personal space. I was traveling with my husband and unlike many other configurations the two middle seats allow two passengers traveling together to actually be together. The food and wine are excellent as usual and the IFE is industry leading. Let me not forget to praise the huge monitor for the IFE. Much larger than other airline's. Delta Business is my preferred airline for international travel. The only areas where they fall a bit short are in the crew professionalism at times. For instance on this flight I was never referred to by name which is just lazy. I just have one other comment and that is I wish they didn't serve a bag of spiced nuts with the first cocktail and instead served something like hot nuts or chips in a dish instead of a bag. Just a little thing but the only are a that isn't top-notch."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","BOS-LAX 738. Boarding was fairly efficient. They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times. It arrived early to LAX and had no wait on takeoff due to mid-morning time slot. Middle seat of my row was empty with aided in comfort. 8/10."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flying from LaGuardia to Dallas the flight was cancelled without the airline letting us know then they had no flights for 10 hours from NYC to Dallas. Really? Not even a connection out of their home town of Atlanta. No apologies no sympathy just the typical ""welcome to New York"" chuckle. You would think the airline could have tried to help my family and me for at least 10 minutes without a sarcastic ""sorry but it could be worse!"""
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Generally I like Delta airlines however they need to have the staff designing connection between small and large airports try to make those flights when the weather isn't perfect. I have had numerous bad experiences connecting between Madison WI and Detroit MI on my way to Boston. I have had to run from one end of DTW to the other end change terminals i.e. run from B to A. I am a Medallion level passenger. Delta needs to work with the Detroit Metro Airport to get connecting flights closer together."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I used to recommend flying Delta to friends and family. I fly very often and they used to do a great job. This past time while flying they disregarded the seats that I had chosen and put me in the very back row on all of my flights. I get very bad anxiety back there and was very unhappy with this. When I kindly and calmly asked them about this they told me that you now need to pay extra in order to choose a seat ahead of time. Flights are already starting to cost a lot more so there is no way that I am going to pay extra for a seat every time that I fly. I will never fly Delta again as long as they operate this way."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Never again with Delta. My wife and I experienced delays after delays yesterday March 18 at JFK after our flight to Montreal got delayed several times. It took us from 11.30 to 00.30 the next day to get from Fort Lauderdale to Montreal with a connection at JFK."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","6th April KL6149 Schiphol to JFK. Very poor service on a transatlantic flight. Plane was loaded when staff knew there was a technical problem which resulted in us being sat on the tarmac for 2 hours. Inflight entertainment was poor (some of it was chargeable). Food provided was poor quality and tasteless. Staff were not very pleasant or personable. This was a very poor experience which I will not be repeating!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I will never book with them again. I am currently stranded in Seattle with my 3 children who I had booked to fly as unaccompanied minors. We called to book their flights and were assured that everything was in order. After a 5 hour drive to the airport today we were told that they could not go on their flight because it was the last flight of the day out of their connecting city. Even after calling twice to confirm everything before we left! We were offered nothing more than an insincere apology. It's like they didn't even care. What pathetic customer service. Will never fly with this airline."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was aboard a 767 from MSP to LAS (economy class) and a 757 from LAS to MSP (first class). Flight attendants were friendly and planes were clean and seemed well maintained. On time departures with easy and smooth landings and take offs."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","YWG-MSP-PHX. Flew YWG-MSP on a CRJ-900. I was on the 1 seat side rather than the 2 seat side so I had both a window and an aisle seat. Flight attendant was friendly and frequently came by with snacks and refills. MSP-PHX was on an A320. A little disappointing that the A320's don't have seatback TV's seat was comfortable and on par with every other airlines First Class on A320's. Flight attendant was also friendly and efficient. Food was fine (I had soup sandwich and chips). Same as the first flight she was came by frequently with snacks and refills. For some reason on the YWG-PHX route Delta's First Class is only $75 more than Economy. Delta is now my preferred airline out of Winnipeg and in my opinion is better than Westjet which I flew home."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DC to Albuquerque with connection through Atlanta. Arrived in Atlanta followed display boards for departing gate. Got to the gate 90 minutes before departure confirmed gate location was correct and sat down. Sat 10' from the counter the whole time and looked out the window. Thought it was strange the plane hadn't arrived yet and they hadn't made any announcements. Gate Agents were busy issuing Delta Dollars to a bunch of passengers from last flight so the area was very busy. Turned around and happened to see on the reader board along the wall (not behind the gate) that there was a gate change. No announcement was ever made in that terminal that the gate had changed and there was no announcement with out names to go to the gate. It was moved from B28 to B3 literally as far apart as you could get from each other. By the time we got to B3 the door had closed. We found a ""red coat"" employee across the hall. She made it seem like we were idiots and there would have been announcements made. She put us on Stand By from Atlanta to Salt Lake City we had 3 shots to get on one of the flights. However it is spring break and Salt Lake is a huge destination point all flights were oversold and had 30+ people on standby for each flight. In the hustle to get from one location to the other and going to 3 different terminals we saw numerous reader boards that indicated gate changes and while sitting in those 3 different terminals we never heard one announcement for any gate change on a Delta flight. We finally had to buy tickets on Southwest so we could get home. While sitting in their terminal we heard announcements for gate changes over and over and they were paging passengers to check in at the gate. I will never fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","CDG to ORD March 3 and one week later back both flights leaved on time plenty of food decent inflight entertainment with a great choice of international movies would fly them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","This is my first experience flying with Delta and I am extremely disappointed. My flight was canceled over 20 hours in advance and I was automatically reassigned to a flight departing 13 hours later. While I appreciate a seat at some point their were 6 flights earlier that I could have been placed on and I was not given a choice. I called Delta and had an associate inform me that I was ""not a priority"" because other flights before mine had been canceled. She also told me my departure weather was the issue she was incorrect. She did absolutely nothing to help me on the phone and was unapologetic. My co-workers on other airlines all departed mostly on time and make it to the same destination I was heading just fine while Delta continued to tell me the weather was not ok. I arrived at the airport at 5am and proceeded to sit in standby flight after flight. As I sit and wait for these flights they are all overbooked by at least 15 seats and I have had several agents act that I am an annoyance when I asked to be put on standby. The attitudes of the agents are generally distasteful and rude. They are treating us as if we are creating the issues and I have offered no apologies on behalf of anyone."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort. I don't imagine I will make much use of it as Delta will be a last choice of airline for me."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta recently on a finally two class plane from YWG-MSP (CRJ-900) I believe. Total trip was YWG-MSP-LAS. I despise the United ERJ-145's and similar small product that was on international routes from YWG previously. Thank you to Delta for slightly upgrading the size of your planes out to MSP. Solid 757-300 economy plus to Las Vegas. Solid crew everything was nice and smooth. The 757 had been refurbished had a great AVOD system. Flights on time crew very friendly. I cannot ask for more on this route. It seems to me Delta is making a large effort to improve their customer service and technology and overall experience. It is working wonders it is amazing how far ahead Delta is of United (my other carrier to Las Vegas through DEN). My preferred US carrier."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Superb flight very helpful cabin crew who couldn't do enough for the passengers and were very friendly. Food good and plentiful as were the drinks. My first time flying with Delta and a very positive experience. Will be booking with them again rather than their partners Virgin who I found (unusually) a little disappointing on the flight home."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I managed to get back home 43 hours after I left my hotel to get my flight from NY JFK to Dublin. Given no explanation left standing in several queues for hours with refreshments only given hours later. When people in the queue started giving out as nobody had given any information or updates a Delta employee got the police. I'll go via Aer Lingus in future as I know they would not treat people like that. The flight return was maybe 15 euros cheaper but what a mistake it was."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I will never fly Delta again. My wife and I were scheduled to fly out of Atlanta to Wilmington and were made to check our carry on bags at the ramp 15 minutes later we were deplaned. We had just waited 45 minutes in the terminal for a flight crew. They board us and tell us weather stopped the flight. Don't insult our intelligence. That plane sat in my view for 4 hours and we were refused our luggage. 24 hours later no one at Delta knows where our bags are. We re-routed to OAJ customer service in Atlanta assured us they where re-routed. This was totally avoidable."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","In early August 2014 I booked a Business Elite ticket from STT to ATL for February 22 2015. My confirmation indicated my seat number and that a meal was included in my ticket. At check-in however I found that Delta had changed my status to Economy with a seat far back in the aircraft. When I called Delta to rectify the situation I and my Son-in-law were both treated rudely. We spent 2 hours on the phone with the result being that I should “ request to be upgraded at the airport. At the airport there was another 30 minute wait before I could talk to a Delta representative only to learn that I'd have to appeal at the boarding desk. A one hour wait ensued at the head of the line at the departure desk while the Delta representative ignored me waited on other people and fiddled with a computer terminal that wasn't working. The end result was the same rudeness and no help at all. I got neither the meal nor the priority baggage check-in that I had paid for. The flight was late arriving in ATL and I had to run to make my connecting flight to BOS. Delta had changed my seat assignment on this flight also. When I called to file a complaint the Delta Supervisor informed me that Delta changes aircraft seat assignments and passenger status without notifying passengers and confirmed that they had sold my assigned seats to more than one person and that these were normal”practices for Delta. I can't imagine why anyone would want to fly with Delta Airlines. Once they have your money they treat you like dirt or worse. There are plenty of other carriers out there. Based on this experience I can't see myself ever flying Delta again. I know I am not alone as there were at least 20 people in line behind me with similar complaints."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Left at the airport in Jamaica for 7.5 hours only to be told the flight was cancelled. Now at 11pm we needed to find our luggage go through the process of finding hotel reservations along with 100 other passengers. The next direct flight home to NYC was in two days. The following morning Delta tells us that our flight leaves in 40 minutes. Now we need to pack and get to the airport fast. We flew business elite and it was so disturbing to find that the armrest was broken and that no wifi or TV. Our choice of meal was eggs or cereal? Should have gone coach. The flight was not cheap and expected more. Realizing now why Delta is not our normal choice of airlines."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","SJU-JFK in Economy Comfort seats. Late night flight out of SJU. Crew were fine. Economy Comfort seats had adequate legroom - glad we paid for the extra room because regular coach seats looked like torture for tall people. In flight entertainment though was terrible. Tiny overhead movie screens. I thought Delta had all seat back video screens. I would have been really annoyed had I spent the money to sit in First - those seats were not so much better than Econ Comfort and the same tiny overhead movie screens every few rows. We were handed a tiny roll with some cheese and turkey and a Milky Way with the beverage service. It was not a memorable flight and on this route JetBlue still wins every time."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from baton Rouge to Orlando Florida via Atlanta. What a mistake! Delayed on our outbound flight to Orlando by more than 5 hours. Delayed on our I bound flight by more than 3 hours. I will never fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","12 hour flight TLV-JFK was excellent because of the crew. Upbeat polite couldn't do enough. Economy seating was fine and 3-3-3 configuration on 777 aircraft is very liveable for that duration. Dinner followed by as many sandwiches peanuts and pretzels as you can eat and as much as many beverages as you like all served with a smile both on request and on cabin pass throughs. Crew on this trip had seniority (I asked) and these were folks who understood the profession of customer service. Video on demand is top in class. A grade. Minus 1 point for lavatories that could have been kept a bit tidier for this long of a flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We were traveling with a 10 month old infant. We were connecting flights at St Paul Airport to Kansas City. Our flight was supposed to depart at 7.35 pm. When we got to the gate we were told the flight was delayed for 2 hours. What amazed me was that the plane was at gate. When we asked then why the delay we were told that because there was no pilot available. Now we are getting stuck with our baby girl in the airport for 2 hours when we had no baby food left. No more Delta for me!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","MAN-AMS-EWR EWR-ATL-MAN. Flights all left on time. Nice FA's. Regular drink/bar service. Nice that you get a bottle of water each. Main issue was that seats were uncomfortable on the flights to NY and back from Atlanta. Flights on these were on old 25 year planes and you felt it."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew NYC-CDG via DTW on Delta. The positive point is I was upgraded to First Class on the US journey but this isn't worth it you only can drink whatever alcohol you like. Seats were uncomfortable on the over-atlantic flight staff rather impolite and not caring at all. Arrived on time. Food was not satisfying not tasty. Entertainment is to my eyes the only interesting point on Delta. Too expensive for so low standards."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","NRT-PDX-NRT in Premium Economy. I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall. Hard to come down from business class with a lie-flat seat and good food."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew Delta from St. Louis to Las Vegas via Minneapolis. All four legs left and arrived about on time. The planes MD-90 and 757 we're clean and comfortable. All four of my flights had wifi. The flight attendants were friendly and offered a small snack on the longer legs. The pilots made announcements as appropriate. I will fly Delta again if given the choice."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LCA-AMS-EWR and EWR-CDG-LCA. Flights on time overall good service. Food drinks and entertainment was good. On return flight was bit delayed because of snow and baggage arrived day after because of handling issues at the transit on French airport (CDG)."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from BOS to DFW via CVG January 23rd. Very good experience small aircraft both legs but clean I was in Economy Comfort. Flight attendants very good with excellent customer service. From CVG to DFW the flight was delayed due maintenance but it was repaired and the flight went without any issues. Arriving in Dallas just some minutes late but the baggage service was very good and the bags were out quickly. My return flight was DFW to BOS via ATL January 29th also very good planes were full both legs. I didn't get economy comfort on DFW-ATL but paid $19 for a preferred seat I think it was not a good idea since got group 2 and almost didn't get space for my carry-on because group 1 passengers almost got it all. I think if you are paying something extra for a seat you should go on group 1 despite that the flight was very good and the flight attendants were ok. The leg from ATL- BOS was very nice I got Economy Comfort flight attendants very professional and cool both flights departed and arrived on time."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LGA-BNA operated by Endeavour Air on Jan 30th. Aircraft - 2 week old CRJ900. Departed 2 hours late due to the plane arriving late and the crew attempting (unsuccessfully) to fix a broken overhead bin lock. Eventually they gave up and scotch-taped the bin cover so it wouldn't open during the flight. Otherwise the flight was uneventful and fairly comfortable. Snacks and soft drinks were distributed and the FA's were attentive. My return flight from BNA got cancelled due to LGA completely shutting down due to the winter storm on Feb 2nd so I got rerouted to JFK via ATL. The 40-minute flight from BNA to ATL was uneventful and was on a completely full 23.5 y.o. A320. No food or drink service on this short flight. The ATL-JFK eventually departed 3 hours late despite most other JFK-bound domestic flight cancelled. The MD88 was completely full which was understandable given that the three previous flights to JFK were cancelled that day. Despite its age the aircraft was comfortable and the flight smooth. Upon landing in JFK we had to wait another 1.5 hours on the taxiway for a gate to become available. Bottom line: Delta got me back home albeit 8 hours late but I think that's pretty good given the circumstances."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew LAX-YVR with Delta. My first time with Delta and I was impressed. Took a 6am flight so I was at the airport at around 4am but the staff was present and was able to lift my mood even without my morning coffee. Barely a wait for security or bag check. When I got to my gate the flight crew was already there and chatting with travellers. Boarding was quick. Unfortunately there was a slight delay due to 'mechanical failure' but I still arrived on time. FA were excellent with 3 drink services (I think) and offering coffee and water in-between. I slept about 1.5 hrs out of the three hour flight comfortably due to the lovely headrests that adjust in multiple ways. Didn't try to recline my chair however."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Suffering from a sinus/head cold I was not anticipating my return from LAX-JFK-BDA on a red eye. My flight was scheduled to depart LAX at 9.40pm and I checked in at Delta's Priority counter around 8:00pm and proceeded quite quickly thru security and found my way to a very crowded SkyClub. When we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to discover that this plane was a newly converted B-767 with the new Business Elite product-proceeding to my seat my coat was stowed and I was served champagne in a champagne glass (so unlike American who still give you those tacky plastic cups) for a pre-flight drink. The seat was 4A and quite comfortable and reclined to a full lie flat bed a nice pillow and quilted blanket as well as an amenity kit. As soon as we were air borne I changed into pajamas and slept most of the way to JFK. The crew were quite keen to help as were the nice ladies in JFK SkyClub during my transit time for BDA. The JFK-BDA flight was also very pleasant although I slept on that one also. All in all a very nice experience with Delta on this route especially with the new Biz Elite product between LAX and JFK-will look forward to doing it again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LAX-JFK-Zurich 24th Dec 2014. Return Jan 7th 2015. First leg of the flight came in late so we missed our connecting flight. They scheduled everyone who missed the connection on the same flight a few hours later ensuring it was busting to capacity. No seats unused. Even though I get airsick and need to be next to the window they refused to accommodate-even though I'd paid more for a window seat on the flight their delay made me miss. Then later delayed on the runway 4 hours-apparently because they were waiting for a manifest. The seats were just atrocious. I've flown economy all my life and never felt so uncomfortable. I will do anything to never have to fly this airline again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Traveled home from New York to Heathrow on 18/1/15 on Delta Airlines at 7pm flight DL401 with my Husband and three friends and our complaint is that the Stewards and the Stewardesses were totally ignorant and only spoke when asking us what we wanted (food and drink). They did not interact with the passengers at all and the food was almost thrown at us this was our first flight with Delta and it will be our last."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My daughter just flew in from Miami they cancelled hundreds of flights because of the incoming storm however they chose not to cancel hers took off 1 hour 15 minutes late. Landed 2 hours 15 minutes late diverted from LaGuardia to JFK shuttle service to LaGuardia was cancelled due to weather and they literally left their customers stranded with no way to retrieve their vehicles to get home. My daughter is currently stranded. This flight should have been cancelled as were all other flights."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Philly Atlanta Sarasota and back. Out was an MD88 and MD90. Had a bad ankle. Gate agents allowed early boarding on both flights. FAs all friendly. Basic service no complaints. All flights all on time aircraft clean and plenty of room at 5' 10"". Return was MD90 and a 757. Again friendly gate agents and FAs flights all on time and overall good service. As an AE platinum card holder got free checked bag each way."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew SYD-DCA via JFK and return from DCA-SYD via LAX. Both flights were really good. Very friendly cabin crew and individual greetings by the captain. Food was average plane food with 3 meal services from the SYD to LAX and LAX to SYD. I would definitely fly Delta again great service good clean aircraft and also a wide range of inflight entertainment."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Columbus (CMH) to Managua Nicaragua and back. Personally I felt that Delta delivered an enjoyable experience and I would gladly travel with them again. 1) My initial flight from CMH to Atlanta went well. We left and arrived on time. The plane itself was clean and neat and seats were surprisingly comfortable although my shoulders could have used a little more room. Flight staff were courteous and even though we were on a booked flight I felt comfortable. 2) We experienced over a one hour delay from Atlanta to Managua and had to wait in the plane for about 45 minutes because of traffic over Florida (not Delta's fault). This plane was not nearly as nice as the first (no seat dividers) but the staff were friendly and the flight was still enjoyable. I flied in the Economy class upon my arriving flight. On the way from Managua to Columbus: 1) I flew in the business class cabin and was immediately greeted by friendly staff who were eager to give me whatever drink I desired. The seats were very comfortable and a delicious meal was served. The flight both left and arrived on time. 2) After arriving back in Atlanta we were greeted by an insanely long line to pass through customs. I don't know how much influence Delta had but I had a two hour lay over and just barely made it to my next flight. For the flight from Atlanta to Columbus I flew in the first class cabin which was surprisingly less comfortable than the business class one that I had been in previously. I slept for the majority of the time but was still given good customer service and the flight both left and arrived on time. After this experience I would recommend Delta but would suggest that you have at least a two hour layover to prevent any problems with connecting to another flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I booked two round trip flights from Houston to Lagos Nigeria. The first leg of the first flight was in October 2014. On this leg I flew business class and the flight was comfortable and very pleasant. The return trips to Houston 2014 in December and to Lagos in January 2015 were a totally different story. I flew economy on these flights. The seats were terribly uncomfortable (even though I was in economy comfort) and the conditions were deplorable. By the end of the flight bathrooms were indescribable! There was all sorts of trash and food in the aisles were the passengers had apparently not taken the time to throw their refuse away. I have never had such a miserable experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated. I've been pretty dissatisfied with American airlines except for Southwest but Delta trumps all of them in terms of flight quality service and passenger dedication. One small irritation: some of the in-flight entertainment is pay-per-view."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Travelled from Detroit to Paris in Business Elite on Delta's Airbus returning from Rome to Atlanta on a B767. To say the least I was extremely pleased on both flights though the 767 was a little tighter in comparison to the B777 and Airbus. Service food were excellent. Delta continues to be my favorite airline."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Connecting flight was boarding when my first flight was landing. Agent at the desk said she would call through but I had to get from one end of the airport to the other. I am an older person and went as fast as I could. My mouth went sandpaper dry and I felt quite faint only to arrive at the next flight to find the gate closed! It was Deltas fault I was late there should have been plenty of time between flights if they hadn't delayed so long leaving a small airport initially that didn't have a line up of flights going out. They spent too much time deciding whether or not to de-ice the plane! I'm glad they were careful and did it but could have got the job done a lot faster and got the flight in on time. As the plane for my next flight was still there I begged the agent at the adjacent gate to allow me to board as I couldn't spend the night and next morning in Minneapolis waiting for a flight to Newark. Fortunately she co-operated called through and they opened the door to let me on. I felt the stewardess was unfriendly as I boarded the plane probably thinking I should have been there on time. I think in situations like this there should be some pick up at the gate to get you to the next flight without having to nearly make yourself sick to get there and following flights should wait for all booked passengers making connections when Delta has caused the delay. This might have been a one off situation. I usually have found Delta friendly and helpful as the agent was who helped me to get on my flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Took the trouble to order kosher and vegetarian meals for my party of 4 only to find that the kosher meal comprised an apple and 2 bananas and the vegetarian meal was some cut melon - Delta seem to have lost all creativity when it comes to meals? To make matters worse since half the flight must have ordered the same special meal none of which was opened or eaten by any passenger the flight crew then proceeded to open each sealed package and throw out the fruit so that they could retrieve their special cheap Delta plates for later use. I personally witnessed at least 20 such meals being discarded. I regret having had to use Delta on this trip after having managed to avoid it for so many years."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK-NRT-SIN. Lounge at JFK was nice the flight was long and seats were narrow. The food could be improved but then again the catering was from JFK so my expectations weren't high. Crew were fine and overall the flight was good. Wish I used the showers in the NRT lounge as I was in for a longer wait than expected. Departure was pushed back an hour and we waited another hour and a half on the ground due to traffic. The staff handled the delay well and the wait was more comfortable than expected. Landed in SIN at 3am as a result. Still good experience overall."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Horrible experience all around. The priority level ticket agent was not able to find the ticket for our lap child wasting 45 minutes of our time at check-in. When it was finally found on their system they were not able to print it for us. Just very frustrating and stressful. The business class on Delta is laughable. Lets see drop down screens from the ceiling no different than they had in the 1980s. The movie didn't even work on the return flight. Food quality I wouldn't even feed to my dogs. Its pretty bad when you buy a business class ticket and you don't even get a movie on a 5.5 hour flight or a decent meal."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My daughter and I traveled from Winnipeg to Basel recently. Our return flight from Paris to Minneapolis was delayed and therefore we had to rush to our connecting flight. Little did we know how far apart the terminals were. Delta staff should have informed us of the distance and offered a passenger trolley. It turned out that as we arrived at our departure gate the information board said ""Boarding"" however the Delta staff person would not let us board. While we waited at least 10 minutes for a supervisor we watched the information change from ""Boarding"" to ""Closed"" and we watched our plane depart without us (along with another passenger in our circumstances). We were booked on another flight seven hours later meal vouchers were denied as we waited the seven hours we saw instances (more than one) where other passengers were allowed to board after the ""Closed"" sign was on. Delta staff were not prepared to assist us in any way nor did they appear to be trained in customer service. This is just one issue albeit the biggest one that we had with Delta personnel giving incorrect information being rude (not the FA - this was all with the staff at the various airports we dealt with). The FA's were wonderful on all flights - perhaps Delta would best be served if they did the training to the airport staff."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","As a frequent traveler I feel I've coped pretty well with the US Airline ""nickel and dime"" mentality that's resulted in baggage fees exorbitant ticket change fees and the dwindling supply base fare economy class seats (not to mention the dwindling leg room in those seats). Now Delta does not allow seat selection with economy class fares. My company do not allow class upgrades which means I'll forever be the really tall guy stuck in a middle bulkhead seat if I fly Delta. Old planes with no power no in-flight entertainment (it never fails to amaze me how many ancient CRT televisions are still mounted to the roof of Delta cabins). On longer flights Delta refuses to stock enough food to meet the demand of passengers towards the back of the plane. Sure I can survive a 6 hour flight with nothing but peanuts and pretzels but why? The only positive thing I can say about Delta is to give a kudos to the majority of attendants that are willing to put up with grouchy passengers and restrictive rules. The ones that maintain a positive attitude deserve an award."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Comfort Economy YYC-HKG return. Booked flight 6 months in advance (and got a great deal) but over the next four months our flight itinerary was changed six times. Since some of the changes impacted our flight by over an hour I called to change to other flights - agents were happy to help out and they answer their phones promptly - a pleasant change compared to the waits we usually experience with our regular airline Air Canada. Alerted by email of all but one of the changes which I noticed by accident. We had paid extra for Comfort Economy and one of the changes meant that the fee for Comfort Economy was higher - instead of notifying us that we needed to pay an extra $20 to keep our Comfort Economy seats they just put us in a regular Economy seat and kept the $130 we'd paid to begin with! Thank goodness I noticed. Flights themselves were good. The extra leg room on the long haul flight was wonderful. Wide selection of entertainment. Plenty of food/drink offered and quality not bad (daytime hot meals ok mid flight snack fine breakfast awful). Service attentive. Very cheerful on the way there and pleasant on the return flight. Connecting flights from Calgary-Seattle were on old planes but fine for a one hour flight - staff were great. I would fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LHR-JFK return. I tend to pick Delta due to the affordability and nice service. Again I was not disappointed. Flight going out of London on time and plane not full. Got plenty of space and the food was good. Coming back to London the flight was packed and the plane was slight older however the food and service was good. I asked for a special meal that was accommodated on both flights! Happy to fly Delta again for sure!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","PDX-AMS-PDX. I was seated in economy plus for the both legs and this is definitely more pleasurable than the basic economy. However the seat cushion still remain hard and quite uncomfortable for a 10 hours flight. Food was okay and very good entertainment system. The crew was professional and attentive on the PDX-AMS. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the return flight was borderline lazy doing the minimum and spending more time socializing on the back of the aircraft than paying attention to the passenger and especially the cleanliness of the bathrooms."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","ATL-JNB-ATL Business Class. Atlanta flight was on time and the flight crew was very ""seasoned"". Service was good. Food was ok. Nothing special. Seats are great - I'm tall and they do the trick. VOD system is outdated and flight tracker rarely works. The return flight was about an hour late and the crew was much better. Food from JNB was much better than first flight. I would rate the second crew as outstanding. It's all about the seat and the business elite seat is among the best for such a long flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew SFO-LAX on a Delta Shuttle emb-175 in first class seat 4A. The seat cushion was pretty hard but fortunately it was only a 50 minute flight. Honestly the first class seats on the emb-175 aren't great and I would never pay for them just upgrade using miles or medallion upgrade."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We flew Delta Airlines 777 business class from LAX to Bangkok (via Narita) in October 2014. The seating configuration is one of the best we have seen internationally. The lie flat seats were enhanced with two pillows and a comforter. The second/smaller pillow worked very well for your legs/knees over the long flight. The comforter was the most enjoyable blanket we have ever experienced on an international trip. It's amazing that such a small difference in quality can make such a large difference in the sleeping comfort and environment. The only complaint about the seat configuration is that it is difficult to communicate with a traveling partner."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","OKC to ATL then ATL to TPA MD 80 from OKC to ATL then twin engined wide body Boeing from ATL to TPA. Seats on both flights were uncomfortable with minimal recline. The headrest pushes my head forward making it difficult for me to nap. On both flights I forgot to bring my seat to the upright position for landing. The FAs didn't notice or might have figured it didn't make any difference. I would not pay to fly Delta in economy or EC on account of the uncomfortable seats. I traveled on a free ticket purchased by my spouse with FF miles so I gave Delta three stars for Value for Money. Food for purchase but items that appealed to me weren't available. The FAs were courteous the flight uneventful. However Delta is my least-favorite airline."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My flight with Delta was a short 1 hour trip from LAX to SFO. It was unfortunately delayed due to bad weather but the service on the flight definitely made up for this. Drinks peanuts and pretzels were offered soon after departing LAX and a healthy snack box filled with trail mix wholegrain crackers guacamole tomatoes celery and carrots was also provided. I did not expect this to be included in the price at all on such a short flight! After flying with another airline on a domestic US trip the service on Delta definitely stood out and I would definitely fly with them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Atlanta-Dubai Economy. FA were very good but the economy seats are very poor. Packed flight so no elbow or leg room. Left on time. Food and service decent."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","PDX-AMS-PDX: Flew on economy comfort for both legs. The PDX-AMS was good with the typical Delta service which has improved over the years. Aircraft was clean and a very good IFE. For the return flight it was quite different starting with a very disorganized Delta security at the gate. The contracted agent were borderline rude and did not have a clue what they were doing. During the flight the cabin crew appeared to do a minimal job and could care less about the service and especially the state of sanitary conditions of the restrooms. Delta management should work on improving the consistency of their crew."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","TPA to LAX on 12-10-14 B737 Economy Comfort another routine Delta Flight. Uncomfortable seats with slightly more legroom than economy but with minimum recline. I give Delta low ratings on account of the uncomfortable seats. Otherwise it's pretty much like other U.S. carriers. Food for purchase. I didn't buy any so rated it at one star. Charge for entertainment headphones didn't buy a set so I also rated entertainment at one star. I fly Delta only because my spouse has Platinum FF status and buys my tickets with her FF miles. Otherwise I'd like to try other airlines."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We bought a round trip ticket trough Air France but the operating airline was Delta. On our outbound flight from ATL-MAD the plane was very small for a Transatlantic flight uncomfortable seats entertainment screens didn't work and the crew were not helpful with the needs of the 1 year old traveling with us well strangely enough this was our ""good flight."" On the way back we flew from Amsterdam to Atlanta the flight got delayed due to bad weather conditions because of that we lost our connecting flight that we can understand what was appalling to us was the rudeness unwillingness to help and basically bad attitude of the flight attendants who are supposedly there to assist you. We certainly will do our best to not purchase a Delta ticket again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Took flight DL403 from JFK to LHR. Bag drop and check in was friendly and fast as was boarding. Seats were leather/plastic and not fabric and felt comfier than many others. Entertainment system was buggy and rebooted once as well as skipping/pausing throughout films. Food was bland but passable: chicken and rice meal with brownie bread and salad for dinner and a croissant with jam for breakfast (with orange juice). Service wasn't that friendly but also the announcements were amateurish with long pauses repeated interruptions and announcing the wrong arrival terminal before later correcting herself! I didn't know until this flight that seat changes within economy class can cost $40 each even if passengers on the same booking were placed in seats far away from each other on different rows (and the seat change was to bring them together)."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","GIG-ATL on refurbed 67-300ER (economy) and can honestly say it was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken. I am 6'2 and whilst normally I can find airline seats restricting this was the worst I have experienced. I can never before remember having to sit open legged as my knees do not fit in the seat when my legs are side by side including when using budget carriers. What's more the head restraint didn't stay in position making it doubly uncomfortable for a man of my height and despite the seat being in the middle of the plane there was no recline (not that there was any room to recline into). Food was ok drinks only served once despite it being almost a 10 hour flight and the entertainment system had only old movies and the TV box sets were missing random episodes meaning it was difficult to watch anything sequentially. Not a good advert for a Delta and will certainly bare this in mind when it comes to booking again in future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DSM/MSP/LHR 30th November LHR/MSP/DSM 6th December 2014. On all of the flights taken I was treated well by all staff check-in and in-flight. The airplanes were clean even the two short haul flights when the turnaround was very tight. Delta cabin staff are certainly the best by a long mile as compared with the other legacy airline staff in the USA. My flights were a combination of First (internally) and Business (Trans Atlantic). The food on the Trans Atlantic flight was pretty good. My only comment regarding the whole food and beverage service was that the red wine on the LHR/MSP leg was chilled. The equipment used for my Trans Atlantic flight was a 767-400ER which was comfortable (I prefer the Business seating in the 767 as opposed to the A330) and I managed to sleep for 4 hours east bound. Delta are a good airline. People can make or break a business and now it certainly seems that the Delta people will ""make"" the business."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK-ATL-AUS in F. Decided to pay First Class to try their product and Delta has done an excellent job revamping their JFK base. Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation. All flights were on-time their hard product is reliable catering is excellent and even though I had some issues with service Delta still provided a great flight experience and would not hesitate to fly with them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","4/30/14 JFK-LHR was a pleasant experience (evening flight). The Delta Ground Crew were fine but had some issues with regards to an additional carry on item when the Airport Customs denied our entry towards the Immigration Area. Boarded on time on a B767-400ER. Seats felt tight with limited legroom but a very comfortable back rest. Ordered our meals online when booking however my meal was not available on the flight but it was fine to wait for the general food selection. Flight entertainment was excellent getting to watch the latest movie releases of the year. Flight Crew were well accommodated on this full flight. Land safely at LHR with a delay of 50 mins. 5/14/14 Return leg LHR-JFK was a disappointment. The older B767-300 aircraft had a rusty smell. Food selections we chose online were again unavailable. Flight crew were less friendly to passengers fewer smiles yet one of the FAs stood out very well in performance. The seats were a lot of worst with thinner padding making it extremely uncomfortable to lean your back all the way. The restrooms were awful unlike the first leg which was spotless. The same goes with the cleanliness of the cabins. Overall flying with Delta would mean riding old planes and comfort is less of a priority in economy class. Delta is my top choice when flying Domestically but definitely out of the box for international and long haul travel. Next time I travel to Europe BA goes next in the list."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","In March 2014 I booked a flight from San Diego to Vancouver BC. There was a one hour stop-over with plane change at LAX. Between that booking and the flight date of November 30th Delta made 6 changes/cancellations to this single reservation resulting in the change in planes being switched to Seattle with a 4 hour stop-over. When my flight arrived in Seattle a further one hour delay was announced. I asked the reason and was told that it was because of ice despite the fact that it was a sunny day with dry pavement everywhere and the plane was coming from Las Vegas. The clerk then mentioned that Delta did not offer compensation for weather-related delays. The lie about icing was confirmed by another clerk who checked in her computer and found the delay was really caused by mechanical failure. I then asked what compensation Delta would give me for a 5 hour stop-over involving dinner time. I was offered a chocolate bar. Delta is the last airline I would choose in the future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have been flying Delta for years (several with Diamond status). I am currently gold status. At JFK Terminal 2 in the TSA pre-check line the Delta representative made me go back and check my bag because it didn't fit in their little container which they claim is what a 22"" bag should fit in. I have been carrying-on the same roller bag for the last 8 years. Now they make me check it? I don't get it. I flew with this same bag this last Saturday the Saturday before that the Thursday before that - and carried it on every time. Terrible customer service for your most loyal business travelers."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL352 from Nashville to Detroit. Advised that the flight will be full and customers are allowed one personal item and one carry-on bag which must fit within the size check box. My carry-on was approximately 1 inch too wide due to my use of the one inch expansion zipper. So my option was to pay to have my bag checked or to use the other small duffle I had inside of my carry-on. So I basically carried on the same weight of items which now took up twice the amount of room. I understand that there has to be rules but common sense needs to come in to play at some point."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DL from Milan to JFK after arriving on Etihad couldn't wait to see how DL matched up. I was impressed with the level of service from crew bantering with passengers smiling as they went about their duties so eager to serve. The IFE and meals were equally impressive far better than my preceding flight on Etihad flight. This is surely an improvement from the Delta I used to know perhaps the competition is bringing out a different side."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DFW-ATL-RSW DFW-ATL in Economy Comfort and ATL-RSW in Economy. Checked in online and it took less than 5 minutes to get through DFW security on a Saturday morning. I was greeted by a friendly gate agent who smiled while welcoming me onboard - what a concept for a domestic airline these days. Onboard the FAs were equally pleasant with the First Class FA even offering to hang the coat of an Economy Class passenger. Snack choice consists of peanuts pretzels or Biscoff - while this isn't much it's still more than you get on any other domestic airline. First leg arrived nearly 20 minutes early and the transit in ATL was painless though keep in mind it is a very large airport if you have a tight connection. Boarding was delayed slightly on the second leg to RSW though we pushed back only a few minutes late and arrived 5 minutes early. This flight was not full and the FAs were once again cheerful while performing the beverage service (but only pretzels this time and no Biscoffs). Captains on both legs kept us well-informed with regards to our route and progress speaking to passengers twice on both legs. Overall I couldn't ask for any more from a domestic flight in coach."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Disappointed traveler. Travelled to Europe via Delta and experience was not good. From terrible food to constantly moving seat assignments unless we upgraded to secure seats together. Food was not very good - service from JFK to PDX was non-existent. I would not recommend this airline and will avoid in the future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","GRU-JFK business class JFK-SEA and LAX-ATL in first class ATL-GRU in business class. Biz class in 767-300s was great lie-flat seats. 1-2-1 configuration. First class was standard. 757 for JFK-SEA not spacious but felt roomier than in the domestic 767 from LAX-ATL (2-2-2 in first class). Food on all flights especially the international legs was good. Having priority check-in at LAX was especially welcome as I didn't have to take my bags over to the checked bag x-ray station. I didn't need the allowance of 3 checked bags up to 70 lbs for biz class to Brazil but it can be a plus. Service was good especially on the international legs. We chose Delta because it cost less than American or United for this trip. Delta's requirements for using frequent flyer miles is worse than the others but the flights were very good."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Four flights with Delta LHR-JFK-TPA_ATL-LHR all flights departed on time seats were comfortable and plenty of legroom including the internal flights food typical airline beef chicken or pasta ok and just about edible. Entertainment was very good with large seat back tvs good selection of movies and shows plus a number of games music selection was disappointing and more variety is needed there. Cabin crew worked hard doing numerous drink runs on the international flights beer and wine is free otherwise about $6/7 for internal flights. I like Delta and would fly them in future if their prices remain competitive."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My wife and I flew first class from Fort Lauderdale to La Guardia on October 27 2014. What a pleasantry that experience was. We flew first class and was extremely pleased with the service and with the attendants courteous manners. The meal we had was hot the drinks were served promptly and we were always asked if there was anything else they could do to ensure us a pleasant flight and comfort."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","12/3 flight 1215 Boston to Salt Lake City. Flight 1674 Salt Lake City to Portland (Oregon). I flew Delta for the first time traveling in first it will definitely be the last. Completely inattentive flight attendants no personal service of any kind - about the only ""perks"" of first were express lines for security and a mass produced meal. In flight received no attention no offers of anything to drink - in fact felt completely ignored."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Took Delta flight from Atlanta to Salt Lake City. I have been flying fairly frequent for the last 10 years and this is the worst plane I have ever been on. The flight is just over four hours and the isn't any form of entertainment not even the really old TV's that 25 rows share. I purchased the gogo inflight wifi that cost me $15 for the four hours and it barley has enough speed to check email. You can definitely forget streaming anything or play any game or app that requires the internet. (I tried) The air conditioning was apparently broken as well because it is about 80+ degrees in the plane. Worst flight/plane I have ever been on. I was on more advanced planes 10 years ago. Staff came by one time to offer any drinks or refreshment."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from Madison-Detroit-Paris-Pisa and return through Rome. On the way there the short flight from Madison was quick and on time. Had plenty of time in Detroit (even though its not the most exciting airport). The transatlantic flight was operated by Air France 777. Excellent as usual. Other short flight to Pisa was okay. Nothing special. On return we rode an A330 from Rome to Detroit. My brother and I had window seats and IFE systems were great. Food was as good as any other airline (though not better than Air France). In Detroit had 2 hours until connection and everything was smooth. Overall great seats food and IFE's both ways."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from Huntsville AL to Atlanta and then to Hong Kong via Seattle. Then returned from Sydney via LAX. On three of the six legs of this trip Delta rearranged our (long in advance) seating. We were notified only once (the night before our morning departure). Supposedly a ""service animal"" was needed in our Economy Comfort seats on the ATL to SEA leg. I understand and accept that. But when we boarded the occupants of the seats we had originally booked the occupants were young and apparently in good heath. No sign of a service animal. I will never again purchase Economy Comfort when it doesn't seem to mean anything and is quite expensive. Also I will do everything I can to not fly Delta in the future. Finally I will tell my story again and again every time I can so that others can be fore-warned."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LHR-JFK-TPA-ATL-LHR. All flights departed on time seats were comfortable with reasonable legroom especially on the internal flight food was typical airline beef or chicken and a pasta on the return leg free beer and wine on the international flights liquor payable by debit or credit card only. Entertainment was very good with seat back large screens and a good selection of movies and TV shows I felt the music selection could be improved by more choice. I have flown Delta 3 times now and find them a good airline and reasonable fares I hope to book my next flights with them."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flown this airline twice from Amsterdam to Detroit and had a terrible experience each time. My flight departing from Amsterdam has always never left on time. Both times my flight was delayed at least 2 hours so in both cases I have missed my onward connecting flight in Detroit. This also resulted in my bag not arriving on time. However apart from the fact that I have never been on a Delta flight that has left or arrived on time the in- flight experience is quite good. Their food is always hot and very tasty they have a good variety in their in flight entertainment and their seats are quite comfy. But due to the fact that I have been delayed and missed my flight so many times because of Delta I will probably never fly them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL836 30 Oct. I fly Delta from HOU-ATL-HNL and return several times each month. I go out of my way to travel through ATL as opposed to DFW on AA or IAH-HNL non-stop on UA. The upgraded A330 cabins with lie flat all-aisle access seats in Business are a refreshing treat from other tired equipment on AA and UA. ATL-HNL is considered an overwater international segment with all the amenities of a transatlantic or transpacific flight. On my recent trip GOGO inflight satellite WIFI was available making a productive business trip in each direction!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew JFK-SLC 5 November 2014. Flew economy in an exit row. Ok flight but entertainment system did not operate full flight with no place to move to. Seat did not recline. 4.5 hour flight excellent FA but had to pay for food (I declined). On time take off and arrival."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DTW-PEK and PVG-DTW Economy comfort. I must say that I fly transpacific on Delta at least 6 times per year and it has been consistently good each trip. They used tired old 747's and A330's from the old Northwest days but a completely refurbished cabin makes it feel like a new plane. Huge new seatback screens feature USB and charging ports. Delta is making an effort to upgrade economy service on transpacific flights handing out free eyeshades earplugs and greatly improved ""Billboard"" branded earbuds. Delta on Demand has hundreds of movies TV and music choices to keep you occupied on these 14 hour flights. Food service is about the same edible but nothing special. Two hot meals and a mid-flight snack consisting of a sandwich fruit and cookie. Service by veteran flight attendants at the top of the seniority list is pleasant and friendly. Overall it can't compare with the Asian airlines on service but not much to complain about."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Highly Recommended. Flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. Check-in was smooth and on time departure. Courteous flight crew good food - was too much though and nice comfortable seat. On-time arrival and speedy baggage delivery. Overall outstanding experience and would like to choose Delta for future international trips."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","BDL-SJC and back via ATL. Coach between BDL and ATL both ways and First between ATL and SJC both ways. First was good unless you are in a bulkhead seat and you are over 6 feet tall. Other than that the aircraft cabin (new 739) was nice and the service was great. Coming back the flight was delayed for an hour which was awful though I slept through the delay. On the bright side I had plenty of time to connect to BDL."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew PDX-ATL ATL-CUN CUN-LAX then LAX-PDX. PDX-ATL was very clean on a very well maintained 737-900 attendants accommodated sister's nut allergy made sure no nuts or nut containing items were opened good IFE good wifi. ATL-CUN was disappointing. Attendants were friendly and hilarious but the MD-88 was in decrepit shape with a broken sound system broken lights broken a/c etc. CUN-LAX was a bit better of a plane but not as good of a 737 as the first flight (737-700 i believe slightly unclean and lots of TV's weren't working) and LAX-PDX on the CRJ900 was great. 2 drinks snacks as expected aircraft was very clean and had a brand new feeling."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Just leaving Detroit for Boston. Overhead bins are half empty. As usual attendants insist baggage be checked which adds considerable and unnecessary time to trip in Boston. Otherwise adequate trip. Seats fairly squeezed but similar to other legacy airlines. No food or entertainment options."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","ALB-IAH DL2033/2249. Delta would not let me choose a seat at purchase or check-in. They put me in a middle seat. Now to get out of the seat (into a window seat in the same row) I need to pay them $19. I did not get a fair chance to select a type of seat I wanted even early on in the process. So I am being forced into an uncomfortable seat and into making a payment if I want to fly with more comfort."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My wife and I were supposed to fly out of Fort Myers on Oct 22/14 after booking our flights two months in advance. When we got to the airport 3 hours before our flight we were told our flight was cancelled and we would have to wait until 8.30 the next day before we could leave. We had to call for a ride ask to stay an additional day - all with no notice! They had all of my contact info and never called. I believe our flight wasn't full so they bumped us to the next morning to fill that flight. This is unacceptable you schedule your flights to fit into your time schedule not theirs. How are you supposed to plan a trip not knowing when they will cancel the flight for no reason do not use Delta if you need to be somewhere on time!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Was pleasantly surprised by Delta service in Economy class on a round trip between DTW and AMS on Oct. 10 (outbound) and Oct 17 (inbound). Cabin services both ways was attentive throughout the flight - something that some other US-based carriers fail to grasp. The Economy class food was actually tasty and abundant especially on the AMS-DTW flight. Am happy to find a US-based carrier that can hold its own in Economy class against its Euro- competitors. So would definitely recommend Delta service between DTW and AMS as a gateway between the US and Europe - even in Economy the journey is part ot the enjoyment of the overall trip."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","October 17th 2014. Traverse City Michigan (TVC) to DTW DTW-LAX LAX-SMF. TVC-DTW and LAX-SMF on Delta Connection. DTW-LAX on Delta. The FAs on the connection flights were courteous and competent. On Delta after the beverage cart had gone by I asked a passing FA for a second glass of wine. She refused to bring it told me I'd have to wait until the beverage cart returned which was over an hour later. The Economy Comfort seats on Delta were not much better than economy - slightly more legroom but the recline seemed the same. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. The Economy Comfort seats on the Connection flights felt more comfortable. Delta provided a wide array of entertainment choices. I only fly Delta because my spouse buys my tickets with her frequent flyer miles. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights on account of the uncomfortable seats. Next time my spouse and I fly to Europe or Asia I will ask her to use her FF miles for flights on a Delta partner with better seats."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","10-12-14 SEA-DTW-TVC. SEA-DTW on Delta DTW-TVC on Delta Connection. The blue vinyl seats on Delta were very uncomfortable had minimal legroom and recline the plastic armrests hurt my arms after an hour or so. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. Seats on Delta Connection were more comfortable. My one star rating is for the Delta seats. I didn't use the inflight entertainment system which appeared to have a good selection. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights. My spouse purchased my ticket with her frequent flyer miles. Next month when we fly from California to Florida I'll ask her to book our flight on a Delta partner if possible. The Delta seats are too uncomfortable for long haul flights. Same goes for our upcoming trips to Europe and Thailand next year."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","In September I flew Delta round trip Detroit - London - Detroit business elite class on planes with the lay-flat seats. Let's be honest and call them ""pods"" not seats. These plastic ""pods"" must be the most uncomfortable cramped seats ever designed for an airplane. I am only 5'1"" weigh 125# and even at that small size I felt wedged into a narrow hard space. Seats are narrow hard moulded vinyl and there is absolutely no room for anything. Couldn't even figure out where to store the provided quilt and pillow. Sit on it? Put it on the floor where it immediately becomes wedged under the seat or you have to walk on it to get out/in your seat? Fold out trays are tiny and almost useless as are the provided ""pockets"" (shallow moulded indents that won't even keep a bottle of water upright) for magazines books papers bottled water etc. Attempting to stand up or leave your seat is a major challenge. Apparently the expected protocol is to wedge yourself into the ""pod"" and not move for eight hours. Never again!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew SYD-LAX 1 Oct and returned 13 Oct - After reading reviews online I was a bits hesitant to fly Delta but was pleasantly surprised by the airline. Found the service to be quite good food had a good variety and all meals were served hot. Also good idea about placing the snacks out for passengers to help themselves. Great choice of movies and TV shows to pass the time. Seats were a little uncomfortable but overall a good experience and would definitely fly Delta again!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Worst business class I have ever travelled on. The product provided on my trip from LA to San Jose is nothing close to what is represented on the Delta website nor as described in their inflight magazine. We had expectations of lie flat beds on the last leg of our long journey from Melbourne (Australia) to San Jose Costa Rica. To make matters worse this last leg with Delta was an overnight flight - so we had been travelling in excess of 24hrs before boarding Delta. What a disappointment to find we were on possibly the oldest aircraft I have flown it had a 2 person bench seat format with an individual backrest that only slightly reclined. The inflight food service was lousy (very similar to an economy meal on a domestic flight). Then to top it off there was a Dog (yes a canine) sitting / sleeping in seat 1B right next to us! There was no insert entertainment system there was a very old box TV hanging from the ceiling in the aisle which from Seat 1D I couldn't quite see very well."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Went from LAX to Sydney. Staff rude food awful. Only good thing was premium economy seating. The seats were hard - no frills but extra leg room. Worth the difference but would not fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew GSO-ATL-SLC-PHX/ LAS-DTW-GSO on a paid First Class ticket - cost only 30% more than the coach ticket and well worth it. DL is working hard to be a serious airline and it's mostly paying off. All flights were on time and generally the service and food very good including a new beef enchilada (really!) lunch item that was excellent. The omelette breakfast out of LAS however- not so much. For me the biggest issue with DL is the age of the fleet. Both long legs were on vintage (25 years old plus) 757s with no modern amenities except pay for WIFI. These old ships showed their age throughout including (my pet peeve) dreadful bathrooms no entertainment whatsoever and old style overhead bins. The one flight with no first class section was aboard the dreaded CRJ200 for a 90 minute flight.. DL generously assigned seat 14A with a GE engine seemingly in the next seat. When will the airlines fulfil their promise of dumping these dogs altogether rather than just moving them from one fleet to another? Overall though satisfaction delivered."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK-FCO return Business class on Sept. 25 - Oct. 5. on A330 - this is the best business class seat by far. Seats newly configured 1-2-1 with easy aisle access. Seat controls entertainment system electronics all user friendly. Lots of entertainment options viewed on a 16-inch flat panel screen. Exceptional service and excellent meal choices."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Honolulu to LA. Lucked out with an internationally equipped aircraft for this normally cramped flight. Great lie flat seat wonderful crew decent meal and excellent entertainment. The B767 business elite made the trip a pleasure but why does the dessert come on the tray when there is plenty of time to do a separate service? This is a pet peeve of mine makes the service seem pedestrian."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Have just arrived in Rio de Janeiro from Miami with a change of planes in Atlanta. From Miami to Atlanta pilot did not even announce the flight duration. From Atlanta to Rio service was certainly not bad by U.S. standards. IFE was good-managed to watch a new release in my personal screen-while alcoholic beverages were also complementary throughout the flight. Arrived on-time in Rio de Janeiro only to find-out that my luggage did not make the tight connection in Atlanta. All in all certainly an acceptable trip and would do it again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Just added Delta to the airlines that I will never fly again. American was the only one with that recognition previously. Booked flight for two from Des Moines to San Francisco and return. Outgoing flight was as planned and no problems. Noticed when I checked in the day before flight that return connection from Minneapolis to DSM had gone from 1 hour to 3+ hour layover. Just tried to change departure time from SFO to Minneapolis so flight would make more sense (1 hour layover). Said they would be happy to for $235! I make sane rationale reservations with ""standard"" layovers and airline changes (or cancels) a flight doesn't inform me and after I learn about it and try to make sense of the booking again they are happy to change for additional $$$. There is something very wrong with this picture. In the future they have 2 empty seats from my wife and me."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew SYD-LAX-MNL. All flights were on time aircraft were clean staff very friendly food satisfactory lavatories well maintained and inflight entertainment stable with a great selection of choices. Safety was adhered to throughout flights. Check-in was smooth. However LAX could have more staff support during the check-in process. Baggage arrived promptly after each flight. Will fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK-LAX on a 757-200 Transcon. Flight pushed back 5 mins ahead of schedule and arrived 30 mins early. The aircraft was recently refitted and the new cabin is spectacular. Felt clean modern fresh airy bright and very comfortable. The IFE was superb. Screens were huge choice was endless and picture quality great (not the standard screens you see on most aircraft). Staff were attentive and happy - came around with the drinks/snacks cart twice and I lost count how many times they came around offering water. Tea/coffee and snacks are complimentary sandwiches etc available for purchase. For a long coast to coast flight Delta far exceeded my expectations."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flights 476 and 477. Flew first Class to Barcelona Spain on August 17 2014. Excellent service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","First class from PDX to LAX. On time good seat comfortable and plenty of space. Easy check in and boarding. Early arrival. Inflight food and beverages woeful. Very limited beverages and my choice of red wine not available. No food apart from a 1/2oz bag of crisps or peanuts. For a two-hour flight something more substantial should be available in First. And nothing else even available for purchase. Staff on board ok. Disappointing apart from the seat comfort and space. I had bought a discounted First class ticket otherwise not worth it. And no access to Delta lounge for First pax unless paid for ($50) or a regular card holder for this service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have had several horrible experiences with Delta. One time on my way back from a vacation from Hawaii Delta changed the connecting flight from the Las Vegas Airport to an earlier time. I was not informed until I arrived in Las Vegas only to find out that our connecting flight had already departed. The Delta Customer Service clerk was extremely unhelpful and ended up booking us on a flight that left 5 hours later. I sat in the Las Vegas airport with two small children for several hours. Today I was supposed to fly out to New York at 11.00 am for an important business trip. As I was leaving for the airport I got a call from Delta stating that the flight was delayed until 12.15 pm. Since that phone call the flight has been further delayed three-times. Delta is the worst airline I have ever flown on hands-down with extremely poor customer service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","First time flying Delta was a terrible experience and I will never fly Delta again. Check in was really bad. My seat did not recline and my flight was LA to Sydney it means 15 hours flying in the same position. The seat was near the back of the plane where the flight attendants stay during the flight. They wouldn't close the curtains so it was always with lights on and I could hear them talking and laughing for 15 hours. It was my worst nightmare and I do not recommend Delta to anyone. There was other seats available but they wouldn't give us other seats."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Sep 1 from TYS-DTW-AMS-GVA return on Sep 15 from GVA-AMS-ATL-TYS. Just returned from traveling and used Delta and KLM. My opinion is that Delta has improved its flight services and food on transcontinental flights. Flights were on time customer service was helpful flight attendants were pleasant. The cabin service was much more adequate than in past flights. We did purchase economy comfort seats on the outgoing flight and the extra inches were appreciated. I was very pleased and will continue to use Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","IMT-DEN-SAN-IMT. All flights were on time or early. Ground and flight attendants courteous and efficient provided timely and useful info. The seats and entertainment on the new B737 are quite good for economy. Beef sandwich for purchase was at best OK. Beverages passed a few times on a 3 hr SAN-MSP flight. In my opinion Delta provides a good consistent product these days."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Extremely poor service. A family of five flew to Orlando via Detroit. After a lot of hassle on my part I was able to organise the special meals for us on our flight to Detroit. It was expected that the airline would have done so the same for the return flight but this did not happen with the result we were denied this request."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Manchester - Atlanta - Quito - August 2014. Flew Delta for the first time in about a decade and was very impressed. Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","NRT-HNL-NRT in business class both ways. The flight was smooth on time had decent food lie-flat seats and a very accommodating HNL-based crew of FA. No complaints whatsoever. It always amazes me at the negative comments on this review site considering my consistently good experiences with Delta. They're not the best airline in the world but they seem to try their best."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta 1487 on 09-04-14 from ATL to JFK. The gate agent addressed my wife and I by name as we boarded. All passengers were greeted by the F/A as they boarded. Flight left a few minutes late but arrived early. The meal consisted of a cold shrimp/chicken platter or a turkey/chicken sandwich which was very good. Service was good. My only complaint is the seating. The seat is more comfortable than Economy Comfort but Delta should add an inch of pitch in the first class cabin. I did not rate the inflight entertainment as there was none available due to the short flight. Delta 2043 first class on 09-11-14 JFK to ATL. Flight left about 30 minutes late due to mechanical problems. The captain gave detailed and many updates concerning takeoff times which was appreciated. The plane was an MD 88. Again no inflight entertainment due to the short flight. Food and beverages included snacks from a basket."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I keep making the mistake of choosing Delta. I flew to Spain recently and now within the us and each time I am unable to be seated with my husband regardless of how in advance I book my tickets. When I just called to inquire about a seat assignment the representative was beyond rude and said if I could not afford the upgrade then I can wait till I get to the gate like always. I have no problem paying for an upgrade but it seems to me they purposely do that so you pay the money or pay by sitting alone! Rude and not accommodating at all."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from Omaha to Minneapolis. Minneapolis to Paris. Paris to Yaounde Cameroon. Returning flight from Yaounde was cancelled. Left the following morning. Flew to Central African Republic then to Chad. From Chad to Paris. Once a 6 hour flight turned into almost 13 hours. One meal provided."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flying on 8/25 from EWR to AMS and return on 9/5 ex AMS to EWR in Economy Comfort. Save your money not worth it. Food was horrible. Flight attendance not very polite. Service was non-existent. I asked for an after dinner drink and was told only coffee Tea or water was available. This is not what Delta advertises on Economy Comfort. Have flown many times on Lufthansa to Germany and the service is 100% better. I will stay away from Delta in the future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","July 28 - August 2 2014. DTW to Las Vegas. My husband and I flew Delta this past July (2014) to Las Vegas. I think the staff did a wonderful job. They always offered snacks and drinks. We will definitely fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","SEA-LHR and AMS-SEA I had an excellent experience on these international flights with Delta. The seats were relatively spacious and comfortable and the IFE was really impressive. The food was edible and there were frequent drink services. I had a far better experience than I did with Air Canada on similar routes. I will definitely be flying with Delta on future trips to Europe."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have had a good experience with Delta so I chose to fly it again. We were flying from Philadelphia to Austin Texas. First off my flight was delayed for an hour and a half. Then we took off. My first stop was Minneapolis. We then had another stop for no reason at Detroit. We then finally got to Austin. Our flight left Philadelpiha at 6am CST and got to Austin at 7pm CST. I will never fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Round trip Detroit to Ft Lauderdale 8/28-9/1. Once again Delta has maintenance issues. We missed our connection lose our first class seats and get home 10 hours late. By the way do not purchase first class tickets. Delta apparently can choose to honor them or not. What a waste of money. I chose to purchase rather than upgrade and still lost my seats. The trip down here in first class offered potato chips for lunch and one drink because our flight attendant spent his time talking to another flight attendant that must have been riding for free because she didn't come out of the galley the entire flight. I guess I should just be happy they got us to our destination. Red coats are useless and maintenance is worst as our plane wasn't the only flight delayed that day due to maintenance."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew MSP-LAX-OGG (Maui) RT and was pleased with Delta in both directions. The flights are long so not terribly comfortable but a very nice attendant suggested that I move to Economy Plus seating for the extra legroom on the outbound to Maui. The food options were tasty and fairly-priced. I appreciated that the crew wore Hawaiian- inspired outfits to put us in a festive mood. Hawaii is such an exceptional destination it deserves the extra touches! Delta is my choice for flights lately because they work hard to deserve my business."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew IND-DTW-JFK to connect to an Air China flight to Beijing there and PVG-DTW-IND on the way back. I was originally suppose to fly IND-JFK to connect to Air China but the flight was delayed to after 9am and I would miss the Air China flight by then. So the agent booked me through Detroit. A320 service to Detroit no food because it was only 30 minutes CRJ900 service to JFK had soda and peanuts. On the way back I was supposed to fly Air China PVG-PEK-JFK and Delta to IND. Air China got delayed and they rebooked me on PVG-DTW-IND Boeing 777 to DTW good food had many choices. No food for the DTW-IND flight as usual. Nice flight attendants good seating good entertainment funny safety video."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew JFK-MCO on Aug 28 in Economy Comfort. Aircraft ok massive delay on taxi way due to congestion. Cabin crew had no control over passengers - children were running up and down aisle yelling banging on seats including when seat belt sign was on. Crew didn't bat an eyelid even when others were out of their seats on final approach with belt light illuminated. We then flew MCO-LAX on Sep 1. Old tired aircraft with video screens fixed to ceiling. Crew inserting VHS tapes for IFE. Cabin smelt dirty carpet dirty everything. Time to retire the 757 fleet. Economy comfort seats hard and uncomfortable."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Mid August. YYZ-MSP-SMF (Toronto - Minneapolis - Sacramento). Return trip. The economy comfort seats from MSP to SMF were adequate decent legroom acceptable recline. Other than legroom they were not much different from the ones on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection from YYZ to MSP. The plastic armrests from MSP-SMF were very uncomfortable. These seats are similar to the ones on Delta international flights. I will no longer fly Delta on internationally and will try another carrier such as KLM on my next trip to Europe. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food no entertainment offered). The flight attendants were competent and courteous."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My wife and I recently flew first class on Delta Airlines from Seattle to San Diego on flight 5789. The aircraft was a Jet Embraer 175 a plane that I think is very practical comfortable and sensible for a domestic flight. Also there are no middle seats anywhere on this plane. The crew were very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was excellent and nicely presented and served by our attentive stewardess. We felt this was the best flight we have taken in a very long time and was reminiscent of air travel from the old days. I have been a frequent air traveler for 55 years so I remember the good old days of travel. I contrast this flight with another first class flight on United Airlines where the service and food were horrible and the plane was filthy with a bathroom that was worse than any gas station I ever saw."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Early August flight from SMF - MSP - YYZ (Sacramento - Minneapolis - Toronto). I flew economy comfort on an early flight from SMF to MSP The MSP to YYZ flight was on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection. The economy comfort seats had adequate legroom but almost no recline making it impossible for me to nap (the seat backs had a tilt-your- head-forward built-in headrest). The seats on Endeavour had minimal legroom but more recline and I was able to nap during the two-hour flight to Toronto. The plastic armrests on the SMF-MSP flight were extremely uncomfortable. Economy comfort wasn't worth the money. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food for purchase no entertainment on either flight). My wife has Delta Platinum FF status. Next month we fly to Michigan Amsterdam France and Israel. I'll let her exchange FF miles for my tickets as long as we avoid Delta and fly internationally on a code share airline such as KLM. The FAs on both flights were competent courteous and seemed to care about their passengers. I wish Delta management had the same attitude."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Dublin - JFK return in business elite. Didn't really get that priority feel on check in as you do with most other airlines. Lounge in Dublin ok lounge in JFK terminal 2 is awful. Food is fine and there was plenty of offerings cabin crew very nice seats very comfortable but I think Virgin Etihad and Qatar Airways business class is far better with a classier feel to it. On saying that I would fly with them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My husband and I have taken a few trips a year with our kids (now 4 and 3) since they were babies and never had such a terrible experience. Getting to our destination was alright - we booked an overnight flight so that the kids would sleep and ended up with 2 extra seats next to us. Staff were all very polite and helpful. However before our return we were informed by e-mail that our 2 flights with a connection of just over an hour had been cancelled and we had been re-booked on 4 flights - yes 3 layovers to get us from one major airport in the US to another in Canada. My husband spent over an hour on the phone getting this changed and it took a great deal of insisting that 4 flights would not work especially with young kids. Our travel dates were flexible as was the departure airport from Florida but this didn't make a difference. We were finally re-booked on 2 flights with an almost 6 hour layover. We were told that having a layover longer than 5 hours would result in additional fees which we of course refused to pay and Delta reluctantly agreed. On the day of the flight we arrived at our gate to find out that our first flight had been delayed almost an hour and our second flight had been delayed 3 hours. (which now resulted in an 8 hour layover!). The airport staff was extremely accommodating and offered to re book us on a flight early the next morning with a 2 hour layover and cover our hotel expenses for the night. We appreciated the offer but decided to decline because we were already at our departure gate and didn't want to repeat the check in and security process the following day. Sometime during our 8 hour layover we looked at our boarding passes and noticed that none of us were sitting together on our second flight. After putting up with an excessive amount of delays and attitude from Delta over the phone and by e-mail I would have gladly left my then 2 and 4 year olds alone for Delta staff to entertain during the flight but after some insisting on my part we were all seated together."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Munich - Atlanta - Kalamazoo and returning from Chicago - Atlanta - Munich. My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered. When it was my turn I was not greeted I was not asked how I was doing and nor was given the generic apology for delays experienced. After a long discussion I was put on a flight from New York - Frankfurt - Munich. After a couple of hours of transit with no amenities or vouchers provided I got on the flight for Frankfurt - I was put right at the back despite various empty seats. I reached Frankfurt to find out - my ticket was never issued for Munich! However being German speaking and after being handed to competent Fraport staff and discussing the issue with them in detail - the situation was dealt with in an excellent manner and I was on my next flight to Munich. Once I touched down in Munich you can now imagine what is going to come or in fact not going to come - my luggage! Will never travel with them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew CDG-MSP-YYZ. First aircraft was an A330-200 which was somewhat spacious. IFE was excellent but the headphones were not that great. Seats were nice and the blanket and pillow were good. The meals were above averages and were filling. A lot of drink services too. Connection was a breeze as well. The flight after that was a CRJ-900 so it was more cramped and without IFE but the aircraft was new and spotless. Seats and service was OK for a regional flight. Wifi on board but you have to pay. All in all the two flights were pleasant and really surprised me."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","MCO-LHR via Atlanta. The internal flight up to Atlanta was surprisingly spacious seating in economy for this short flight. The transatlantic flight from Atlanta to London was on a B767 with a decent seat with good leg room. The IFE offers a good choice to occupy the time and the meal was ok and standard for economy. Delta is a no nonsense airline that does the job you pay for."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew MEX-DTW recently on Delta on a nice and fairly clean A319. Economy class seats had decent legroom - inflight wifi was a huge plus but no other IFE was on offer even in business class. Ham and cheese sandwich was served as a snack which surprised me as I expected no food in economy class. Flight arrived and departed on time. Staff were attentive and polite."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Traveled from SYD-LAX return in Economy Comfort on Boeing 777-200. Service was ok but the seats are very hard and uncomfortable. Had a look at the Business class seats when disembarking and they felt just as hard. Really needs refurbishing."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","A few months ago I was flying home from Chicago via Minneapolis. I don't really care to connect but Delta had the lowest fares and I was okay with that. The flight to Minneapolis from Chicago was delayed due to a plane issue. The staff on the ground were excellent at handling the issue and on the plane they were helpful as well. Unfortunately this was not the case with the rest of the staff. Upon arrival to Minneapolis I had to run to my gate to make my flight. As I got there I had to argue with the gate attendant about getting my seat. Note I'm a 17 year old who can't book a hotel has nowhere to stay and needs to be on that flight the last one out that night. Thankfully the man gave me his seat and I made it home. Staff on the MSP-MCO leg were very rude. I was very unimpressed. I love Delta but it put a sour taste in my mouth."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We are a family of 6 going on vacation from San Jose California to Las Vegas with a connecting flight in Los Angeles. We missed our flight from San Jose to LA and therefore missed our connecting flight from LA to Vegas and therefore wasted a whole day (1/3 of our trip) in LAX. We missed our flight in San Jose because we did not arrive at the gate until the last 3 min of departing time. However two of our family members arrived at the gate early because they used the handicapped express lane at security point. The family members that arrived early told the gate agent that there are more people coming please wait. The agent was rude did not even page for our names and refuse to wait. By the time the rest of the family got to the gate the plane has already taken off 2min earlier which is 5 min earlier than departing time! This kind of customer service is unacceptable!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","NRT-ATL in business elite. The aircraft is an old 747 but renovated a few years back with the lie flat seats and if you're in the upper deck very nice indeed. It's quiet two toilets for less than 20 passengers and two flight attendants. The entertainment selection is excellent. My vegetarian meal was OK nothing special but not bad. It was a smooth and comfortable flight. The only complaint I have is about the service. The FA's on US carriers are very familiar and have a jokey attitude that I think most Americans quite enjoy. I have lived overseas for over 20 years and do not like that. I prefer kind polite service without the constant sarcasm and humor."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was on Delta Flight DL101 from Atlanta to Buenos Aires. The flight took of with some delay and after 2 hours in the air we returned again to Atlanta due to a problem with the plane. The problem came afterwards. We arrived at 4 am our new departure was delayed. Nobody from Delta provided a clear view of what the plan was. 12 hours after our original departure time we were still at the airport and nobody from Delta would give an answer. Last time on a Delta Flight for me."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Was scheduled afternoon of 8/11/14 to fly from Lansing MI to Minneapolis then on to DFW. About 2.5 hours before flight received automated call that flight from Lansing had been cancelled and that they would call back with a rebooking (no explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled). Automated call back had put me on a flight out the next day at around 1.30 in the afternoon getting me to Dallas about 5.30pm on 12th. I called back and managed to get rebooked on a flight on the 12th leaving Lansing to Detriot at 6am then on to DFW getting in around 9.20am the next day (an effort to try to salvage most of the work day on the 12th). Arrived to Lansing airport about 4.30am on the 12th only to be told that the 6am flight was also cancelled (again gate agent had no explanation of why the flight was cancelled). Their only option was to put me on the same afternoon flight the automated service had booked me on the previous day. My 80-something year old parents ended up driving me to Detroit to make the 7.28am connection. Complained to Delta and was given a refund of about $29 (which I haven't seen yet). This didn't even cover the cost of the fuel my parents used to get from Lansing to Detroit and back)."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Economy LHR-MCO via BOS. First time in 4 years with Delta and I have to say I was impressed. The seat on the 767 out of LHR was fine (and I am a big chap) with good leg room. Flight attendants were professional if not a little unsmiling. Food service was good and drinks complimentary. The IFE was good with a good selection. The internal flight down to MCO was delayed an hour due to bad weather but we made up some time during the flight. For me Delta is a no nonsense service that ticks boxes without the wow factor."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta did not notify me of flight cancellation of a direct flight from PHX to JFK airport that was to leave at 8.30 which had been changed previously from 9.30 until we had arrived at the terminal. Put us on a flight to Atlanta Airport transferred to another flight to JFK. After boarding waited for about an hour to find out they could not take off due to weather. We were then put on standby at another Atlanta terminal. We had advised the counter person that we had a doctor's appointment in NY the next morning and needed to get there. In watching the monitor for open seats I noticed they were asking for people that wanted to upgrade to 1st class. We had paid for 1st class round-trip tickets and were not called to fill in those seats. Because I complained about the service we were able to take those seats. We arrived At JFK at about 1.30 am the next day. Because of Delta we paid for a $200 hotel room that we did not use. When leaving JFK on our return trip on Delta we sat on the plane for 1.5 hours for a cap from a baggage handler to be removed from engine that had been sucked into it we finally took off. We should have been treated more courteously and not like a herd of cattle especially as a 1st class ticket holder. We paid for more!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from Mumbai to Detroit with a layover at Amsterdam with the total flight duration of 18.5 hours. The delta flight from Mumbai left about 1.5 hours late and the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit left 15 mins earlier leaving us stranded at Amsterdam. I was then rebooked to fly from Amsterdam to Chicago and Chicago to Detroit all the direct Detroit flights being overbooked. I had no choice but to take the flight to Detroit the flight from Chicago to Detroit was being taken care of by ""United Airlines""."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","July 25 2014 Miami - Atlanta - Asheville return August 3 2014. All flights leaving and returning on time. Clean aircraft. Pleasant flight attendants. Would fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Took a flight from Phoenix AZ to Rochester NY with a plane change in Minneapolis MN. I arrived at Minneapolis 40 minutes between flights so plenty of time then we were told that there will be a delay because of mechanical issues and had to wait for a new plane. While we were waiting at the next gate we found out that plane was also delayed for mechanical issues. The replacement plane finally arrived 2 hours later we boarded and were just about to back out of the gate when the captain announced that we will be delayed for mechanical issues. I arrived 2.5 hours later from my scheduled arrival time. The return trip wasn't any better the plane arrived 2 hours late. I arrived in Atlanta as my connecting flight was taking off. That was the last flight out of Atlanta until the next morning. I got my ticket no problem but when I asked about a hotel. They would only give me a coupon for a reduced rate. I felt I shouldn't have to pay for something g that wasn't my fault. So I got to spend 12+ hours in the terminal. Never flying Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew late July on Delta round trip from Minneapolis to Beijing and back with two layovers in Seattle (SEA to MSP was on Alaska Airlines code share not included in ratings). Booked through travel agency. Overall an enjoyable and satisfactory trip. Only item of note is that a travel companion lost her passport on the MSP to SEA flight and couldn't board the plane to Beijing in Seattle help staff at SEA were very helpful and accommodating they got her passport back and put her on the next flight to Beijing."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was almost convinced to switch to Delta from US Airways and United where I have status. For 3 of 4 legs of travel the flight attendants and gate agents were friendly and professional and the service was good. This was my second flight on Delta and I was unfamiliar with their seating protocol. On August 8 Flight 5151 from LGA to CLT I asked a flight attendant if the flight was full and if I could move my seat. She did not refuse. Another flight attendant arrived and the two attendants had a less than professional conversation. She then walked up to me with a flight manage at and asked if I was passenger (name) and then said I could not sit in this seat because these seats were Premium. It was a false show. The first attendant could have asked if I'd like to upgrade to Premium or provided an honest response simply saying ""Unfortunately no."" Honesty integrity and professionalism is important."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Last year I had a flight from Dubai to Atlanta. The flight was supposed to take off at 9.30pm from Dubai. We were told that the flight was delayed 3 hours. At 12.30am they said it was still delayed by 4 more hours. At 4.30 they got everyone onboard and the flight didn't take of until 9am. Then they announced that due to some technical faults the flight was cancelled. We were asked to sit in the Airport Lounge for whole day. After 15 hours the flight took off. Overall the flight was delayed by approx 27 hours. They did not want to provide hotel accommodation the staff were very rude. No one was interested in responding to our questions."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","GRU-ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW-GRU business class. Very comfortable truly lie-flat seats in 767s for the international legs (maybe not quite as nice as the A330s of US Airways in biz class). My wife had asked for boarding assistance due to an arm injury and she said whenever she made any move on the GRU-ATL leg an attendant was at her side almost immediately. No Delta club at GRU so had to use the somewhat smaller and more basic Gol Airlines club. First class for the ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW legs was your basic domestic first class. Nothing spectacular but fine. Decent selection of movies at least in the 767s."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DEN-JFK then CDG-MSP-DEN in Business. Was pleasantly surprised as I had not travelled DL in about 10 years. Domestic segments decent with excellent service and meals. Crew chatty and actually acted like they wanted to there. CDG-MSP with flat seats on A330. Crew were okay but still miss the class of European carriers and kindness of EK/SQ. No smiles and rather perfunctory service. Food better than AF and seat much better; Entertainment was excellent with big screen and got about 3 hours of good sleep. Only negative was appalling ground staff at JFK- rude surly and could care less. Will avoid JFK as best as I can."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","One thing I find really ironic with Delta Airlines is at the beginning of the safety video they state that ""your comfort and needs are our first priority"" when it's is absolutely not the case it seems like it's the profit Delta can make. I'm not normally one to complain however after flying with Delta 3 times something needed to be said. From LA to NY return and from NY to Honolulu my family were unable to have seating together due to not booking a 'particular way' despite the fact we booked months in advance! It seems this manner of booking was only available to people who booked in USA as no information on booking allocated seats was known to us (Australian origin). Moreover we weren't the only people who encountered this issue. Another passenger was unable to be seated with their 4 and 8 year old children due to their ridiculous seating policy. Do it the right way Delta first checked in first choice. Service was bad. Rude at check in. Rude and unhelpful at the gate and even on flight they held their tradition by attendants having domestic quarrels on the plane around passengers. Food is terrible all flights are over 5 hours and only offered 2 biscuits or a small bag of pretzels unless you pay. Some entertainment also unavailable; however what was available were decent movies. Surprisingly Delta can do something right. Save your time money and hunger for an airline who cares about their passengers needs. This service isn't even worth the $10 you would pay to watch the entertainment available."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","ATL to UIO on DL 673. Flight was on an ageing 757. Paid extra for comfort class row 19. Narrow seat due to tray in arm rest. Try was broken and FA could care less. Offered no help. Food of poor quality/taste. Entertainment system from last century. Crew member makes PA announcement for anyone needing the lav to go before they pull the carts. 10 people queue up in front of my seat and wait. Crew fighting with each other over cabin responsibilities. Extended delay in FA picking up dirty trays which sat for almost one solid hour. Bad flight in every regard!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK-YUL on Delta Connection embraer regional jet. Terminal 2 at JFK must be the worst place in the world to change planes. After entering the path to the aircraft it became worse as the metal tunnel seemed to be falling to bits loose floor and walls looked like they had been run over several times. Inflight service was dire and not at mainline airline standard - inflight entertainment consists of the safety briefing and looking out the window. Inflight snack service consists of biting your own fingernails. Although flight was early this level of service is what I expect from cheap airlines like Ryanair not those charging a premium price. Look for alternatives."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My latest flight on Delta was PHL-MSP-AMS-ARN-AMS-JFK-PHL. Why such a circuitous route to Stockholm? Delta's service: I seem to be the lucky person who gets a great flight crew (even when in Coach) good food and on time departures. The upgrade of the business cabin to business elite with lie flat beds was a great way to fully relax and get quality sleep. Even though I am now based in USAIR/American country I still fly Delta - and know a lot of great people in all of their hubs. Only drawback is their very restrictive FF program. But day to day I would rather have a good flight experience over using my miles to upgrade."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight DL0056 Detroit to Heathrow: Passenger console did not work neither reading light nor audio/visual entertainment. For almost 7 hours I had nothing to do as I could not read or watch video. I asked for assistance but received no help or offer to move me to another seat."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight 1545 on July 18 did not have the full snack loaded for the first class passengers. So they served a ""fruit plate"" complete with pickle to go with the absent sandwich. Beware of first-class seats. The front rows do not have any place to put your feet. You pay a lot for a seat with little leg room."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Frankfurt - JFK on a B763. Very good experience: Nice seat pitch (for comparable ranks) cheerful and attentive service tasty meal and punctual take off."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My experience with Delta was extremely frustrating. I bought 3 tickets from Milan to Denver with stop in Atlanta. One month before departure Delta changed the itinerary in Milan-JFK-Minneapolis-Denver which was exactly what I was not looking for (2 stops rather than 1). Too late to change tickets because of high prices. From NY we took off more than 2 hours late most time spent inside a super hot aircraft on a taxiway and consequently we were not able to get the flight from Minneapolis to Denver. Rescheduled for the next day we were forced to spend the night in the airport because the customer service horrible was not able to find a room in Minneapolis. Next day we took off late again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from Amsterdam to Boston DL267 Economy Comfort service was excellent FA's chatted and were very kind. I have noted that past reviews of Delta are not very good but that seems to be inter-American and not Delta's international flights. The Comfort seats have plenty of leg-room and are very good for a 7 hour flight and as they are just behind Business Class you de-board very quickly ! Flight back DL266 was just as good so I will be telling everyone to fly Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from Atlanta to Las Vegas return for business convention. Smooth on time flight both ways excellent service and professional staff. On the flight back we sat on the tarmac for an extra 10 minutes or so. The pilot then proceeded to the runway. On the way he explained that he requested an alternate route out of Las Vegas since he wanted to avoid storm clouds and turbulent weather. I'm a nervous flyer and I was very impressed that Delta will actually do this. I'm sure it affected there on time statistics and probably cost Delta more in fuel expenses to take an alternate route. I will fly Delta from now on."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Business Elite MSP-SEA-PEK-SEA-MSP. All Sectors were excellent. International Service was fine. Food was good. All Flights were on time and had a chance to use the new immigration Kiosk's. It was a little faster. Not sure why but got a hand written note from the purser thanking me for my business. I see a definite improvement with Delta. I hope it continues."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","No more pre-boarding for passengers with children really? On a recent flight my family was instructed that Delta no longer allows passengers with small children to pre-board because there is now a pre-board fee that passengers are paying and 'got upset' that others were allowed to do so for free. This is yet another example of how Delta airlines are cutting service and delaying the overall boarding process. As a business owner and traveler I understand the desire to make money but this is going too far! Going forward I will research flights and airlines that are willing to accommodate my traveling family. My extra dollars will be well spent on an airline that values service first and foremost."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I've flown Delta about 15-20 times. 90% of those trips have been work trips where I've not been given the option of flight provider. My current trip to Alaska from PHL leaves me without either of my bags because the Delta connecting flight out of MSP was 45 minutes delayed. Why was it delayed? Because they needed to kick 8 people off due to weight. This makes me wonder if they knew where they were flying before we got on. How can this oversight occur? Either way when I arrived in Anchorage to catch the connecting flight I had to run across the airport to make my flight with no time to spare. My bags didn't make it. Well now it's the next day and they can't confirm when my bags will arrive."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My flight was delayed not for any weather or mechanical issue but because the captain of our plane decide not to show up to fly us. It has been almost double the flight time itself waiting in the terminal. This is completely unacceptable and I am disappointed with Delta who have always been a dependable airline. The remainder of staff handled it very well but I lost a lot of faith in Delta Airlines today."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DL #231 from Amsterdam to Boston on July 6 and I have to say that it was a great flight. On time departure early arrival. Very tasty meal (Thai chicken) perfectly adequate amount of food. Nice snacks first an ice cream then a sandwich. I really appreciate the large bottle of water everyone gets after the meal service. Inflight service was very efficient though I think the flight attendants could have smiled a bit more. Seat size and pitch were comfortable and I'm not a small person. Inflight entertainment was outstanding - a huge choice of movies both new releases and older classics - that I really didn't want the flight to end. Perhaps I'm just easily pleased but I found this Economy Class experience to be very good."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","SFO-ATL on June 27 apparently an equipment change where I went from exit row aisle to row 45 next to the toilet. Not bad for a platinum 2 million miler! Finally found a gate manager who helped fix the problem but none of the front line employees can make a decision."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight 718. This flight was booked almost one year ago. All 15 family members had seats together. Now we are leaving in a few days and guess what? Three members of our family have had their seats changed. When asked to give us back our original seats the representative supervisor stated they could not accommodate our request. They stated they have the right to change any seat. Well why can't they do the right thing and accommodate their customer and give us back our original seats and move the passengers to our new unwanted seats."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew BOG-JFK-BOG. Check in at both ends flawless both flights left on time and arrived before schedule which I think is a great achievement. Service was good breakfast on the BOG-JFK very poor meal on the JFK-BOG was much better. Seats were uncomfortable but we had a great price for our tickets."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Daughter took a flight from RDU-LAX. Flight attendant asked her to move her seat to accommodate a family who wanted to sit together then gave her a seat that didn't recline. It was unfortunate because a) by the time she realized she'd been duped the flight was taking off - and b) she just started flying and didn't know her rights as a passenger. My daughter did the airline a huge favor and got duped. It's a shame since my husband is an elite member who has been raving about Delta's supposed great service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My experience started in Chicago on a flight bound for Phoenix via Minneapolis and a weather delay in Minneapolis. The experience quickly went from bad to abysmal after being delayed in Chicago. The flight crew could not help anyone with connections in Minneapolis. Although it was still afternoon the 800 number people were unable to come up with any alternate route. After nearly 4 hours of delay which included all the passengers deplaning we were loaded onto the plane after the gate next to us with a later flight going Minneapolis loaded. My flight to Phoenix which had also been delayed due to weather left 30 minutes before I got there and had our flight gone first as it should have I probably would have made my connection. But the Delta personal were unable or unwilling to deal with passenger issues like this. Instead I bunked down in the Minneapolis airport overnight. Meals were not provided even though all the restaurants in the airport were closed or closing when we arrived. The next day after 27.5 hours of travel I arrived in Phoenix but one of my bags did not. So while I understand that weather happens this airline has an appalling lack of kindness consideration or concern about getting people and their luggage to their destination."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I bought a First Class ticket on Delta from Detroit to Newark. I'm on my third day of attempting to get there. There were endless delays and finally cancellation of the flights the first two days. I was on standby for two morning flights which took off. Delta was upgrading passengers on both flights and left me in the lurch. Passengers were getting information about further delays before the Delta agents were. Delta wasn't responsible for the cancellation of the flights but they didn't do anything to get me to my destination in a timely fashion. The ticket I got for today's flight is in coach which is OK with me as long as I get to my destination. Later I got what Delta called a ""complementary upgrade"" - and I'm thinking complementary nothing I paid for a first class ticket. The only thing Delta is excellent at is the phrase everyone at Delta seems to have been trained to use (hence insincere): We apologize for the inconvenience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Traveled many times with Delta and so far one airport layover stay due to delays which was fine at first until this time around. Had to stay overnight in Atlanta. Customer service is horrible. Flight times change a lot. One time I had to change an existing flight but the flight that I changed to got canceled. I do not understand why I couldn't get a reimbursement for the change fee when the flight that I wanted doesn't even exist anymore. Now that I know better I'd rather pay for a more reliable airline than stick with cheaper fares for essentially a game of chance. Will avoid this airline in the future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Delta first class from Atlanta to San Francisco quite possibly the worst flight crew ever more interested in talking to each other than helping passengers one flight crew tried to give my blazer to 2 separate passengers before it got to me unacceptable when you pay to fly first. Cramped seating did not help matters either. A very unpleasant flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta is extremely frustrating to deal with! We took a family vacation to Alaska. There were 8 of us and we had two stops each way. I reserved seats when I booked the flights. When I checked in online for every flight for all 8 of us I found that all of the seats had been changed for every flight! We were on a family vacation and I picked seats for a reason. The answer I got every time I called was that they switch planes a lot and the seats don't match. I can't imagine that all of the planes were changed! I hope that I never have to fly Delta again! They need to take lessons from Alaska and Southwest!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Marked difference in quality and service between transatlantic and domestic flights travelled Dublin to PDX and back via ATL and both transatlantic legs progressed well with excellent service and no delays while both internal flights were delayed onboard service was spotty at best and boarding was sheer pandemonium. I have never appreciated Ryanair more than after my first experience trying to board a domestic flight in the US."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Short flight Shanghai to Narita. Very well done. 777 Business Elite has an odd layout can't see out window even in window seat without craning neck. Other than that comfortable nice breakfast and excellent professional crew. Bring that style to domestic flights and Delta will succeed."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta 2366 JFK to MSP. Delayed for broken plane - we were in line to take off when they decided a broken panel light warranted fixing. We had no gate to return to at JFK so we went to the maintenance lot and were bussed back to the terminal. Had to wait for a new plane (another hour). Re-boarding pandemonium. Most frustrating was waiting another hour on the tarmac before taxi-ing await from gate for catering. this was around 11.30am. We got nothing to eat drink except one bottle of water. Arrived MSP around 12.30am. Pretty awful. Stewardesses standing around on their cell phone. Skip Delta if you have the chance."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flights in purchased domestic first class with changeover in Minneapolis. Lots of weather delays and was kept well informed and phone conversations with customer service were pleasant. The first three legs of the journey were nothing special. Notably the quality of the product purchased was only that of a larger seat. Inflight service was casual at best and I would not call it friendly. We were tolerated and it kind of felt like we were an inconvenience. The last flight however had a flight attendant who was service oriented and actually took care of the customer properly and a meal was served. To me this tells me that there is a quality issue at Delta. The inflight service product is not consistent."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The CRJ 700 service from Halifax to La Guardia in New York is a quick 90 min hop. The economy seats are cramped but they are on all the Canadair regional jets in economy class. I got my drink. I got my pretzels. And other than that the flight was completely uneventful. This is when you realise flying has become a complete commodity. Now how could we change that?"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","This flight was in ""Business Elite"" between Austin Texas and Buenos Aires Argentina with an intermediate stop in Atlanta Georgia. The outbound trip was in early February 2014 and the return was in mid February 2014. Measured against other US carriers international performance Delta was exceptional. Measured against other international carriers their comparative performance was at the least ""competitive"". Other than one sort of ""rough around the edges"" male flight attendant on the return trip the entire experience was quite acceptable."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Mar 30 NRT to BKK. All flights were great. Flight was on-time and the in-flight entertainment was great. Apart from the meals - some Thai passengers cannot eat beef so the flight crews tried to ask other passengers who could eat beef and changed the meals around. We feel disappointed with their food services."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight 2463 leaving West Palm Beach (PBI) at 2.42pm on June 15 arriving at New York LaGuardia (LGA) at 5.30pm. I was slated to take flight 3997 from LaGuardia to Pittsburgh (PIT) leaving at 6.59pm arriving in Pittsburgh at 8.35pm. Every time I fly Delta I end up getting stuck in whatever airport my layover is for 12+ hours due to cancellations or delays. There is no attempt to accommodate me the customer with a hotel for the night a partial refund or even a blanket or pillow for my extended stay in the airport."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Delta Website froze 4 times trying to set up flight to three different locations. Had to call and set up over the phone only to find out at the curb our flights were changed with no coumarin to us. My pregnant wife and I sat for over an hour (on the curb) for them to correct the error. We flew to our next location to find the same issue with boarding. We sat outside the line for a half hour while they tried to correct before the plane flew off. I spoke to Delta and they said because of the economy they are having issues. This does not explain why they couldn't send us an e-mail showing our flights changed with new boarding passes. The worst flying experience ever. They could care less about you even if you need special attention. Check baggage fees - Delta packs the plane and charges outrageous prices for additional bags."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I just returned from a round-trip First/Business Elite FLL-ATL-MUC-ATL-FLL trip. I really must say that all the flights were great. Every flight was on-time the flight crews were exceptionally good the in-flight entertainment was good but could be improved the meals were good and tasty. I only wish Delta would update its meal service and add some new items. Going over to MUC the man behind me even commented to the flight attendant ""Is it the usual?"" It is always steak chicken breast pasta (no meat or fish - just pasta) and a cold plate. I've written to DL about adding fish lamb duck etc. to the rotation. (They actually had lamb on the MUC-ATL flight!) Even flight attendants say that every time they have ""fish"" it is the most ordered by passengers. I guess Michelle Bernstein has run out of ideas. That is my only suggestion to improve things in Business Elite: Get more imaginative on the meal offerings! It really isn't that difficult."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Round-trip flight from Quito Ecuador to Birmingham Alabama with one stop in Atlanta. The check in process was difficult since we are foreigners trying to leave the country. Nothing against Delta. The delta gate agents went through 3 security procedures before we even lined up to go to the plane. I think it was the airport's rules. I flew a Delta 757-200 to Atlanta on a red-eye flight. We took off around 11.40 pm and we started flying over the Pacific Ocean. There was no personal entertainment on this type of aircraft so we were forced to watch a movie. They started serving ""breakfast"" around 1.20 am. ""Breakfast"" was a cold turkey and mayonnaise sandwich fruit and a brownie. They took they tray away and we did not eat anything else. Around 5.00 am we started our descent into Atlanta. The landing was smooth and we soon de-boarded and headed through immigration to board our next 56 min flight to Birmingham. Atlanta airport is very confusing as to where restaurants and lounges are. We boarded our MD88 to Birmingham. Since it was an hour flight they should have served us something but the didn't. We landed in Birmingham smoothly."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Narita - Bangkok June 13 Business Elite 747. Slight delay due to hold for other delayed inbound flights but all in all an excellent flight. Chief Purser was an experienced friendly (old school) gentleman who worked hard to insure good service. Seat was a comfortable lie flat pod offering more privacy than the first class American 777 I had just connected from. Decent food with even a light second offering before landing. Excellent entertainment options offered. I would certainly do this again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight from NY La Guardia to Cleveland OH at 01.15am email said flight would be delayed by 2 hours. Delayed our taxi to airport by 2 hours. Got to airport to find flight now cancelled but no email communication from Delta no phone call just the pleasure of an extra 1.5 hours at the airport as they had rebooked us onto 3.20 flight. Staff no training in apologising to passengers for inconvenience - staff couldn't give a damn. Although travelling with my husband they couldn't be bothered to sit us together. So was the flight cancelled for bad weather? I don't think so. Too many additional reasons given eg staff not able to fly as on duty too long etc. We then discovered that the earlier flight had been cancelled too. Could this have been about consolidation. Advice don't travel with them if you can avoid them."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Originally I had a 2 hour layover. Delta changed our flights to a 4 hour layover. The plane now has been delayed another 20 minutes so my family of 6 and I are at the airport right now for a 4.5 hour layover. This is not acceptable Delta should do something about this. Fly with an airline that cares. It's surely not Delta!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We flew paid business class fares in Delta's Business Elite LAX to SYD and SYD to LAX in the forward B/E cabin on Delta's 777-200LR. We checked in using the kiosks in Delta's terminal and went through security quickly (we are both Global Entry/Precheck). The Delta SkyClub at LAX which doubles as Delta's business class lounge was crowded noisy and inferior in all respects to the business class lounges operated by other carriers to Australia we've flown on (ANZ and QF). For what it's worth Delta uses the ANZ business class lounge in Sydney and in all respects it's superior to Delta's SkyClub. The flight was delayed. Despite Delta's explanations the real reason for the constant late departures is that Sydney's airport operates under a curfew. It's the same problem coming back to LAX as ICE/Customs don't start clearing baggage/passengers until 8am - resulting in people sitting on the plane for a fair amount of time following arrival. Once in the air the flight itself was OK. The Delta flatbed seat on the 777-200 is adequate but inferior to the seats on ANZ's 777 and the QF A380 - both of those airlines provide business class passengers with a mattress that is laid over the top of the seat when reclined. The meal service both directions was in all respects inferior to business class meal services on ANZ QF and CX. The portions are tiny and the food itself is mediocre. The cabin crew LAX to SYD was OK but the crew returning SYD- LAX was disorganized distracted and not terribly personable. Delta's AVOD system on its 777 aircraft is antiquated. The pop-out monitors will not stay upright - many passengers around us had this problem. The moving map and flight information displays need to be updated. The headphones provided by Delta are supposed to be noise cancelling but don't work well (we both use Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones so it really didn't matter). Given the cost of business class tickets and all things being equal the only thing Delta has going for it on its 777 service to/from SYD is the privacy and relative quiet of its herringbone seating arrangement. Otherwise based on any other criteria you choose to use Delta's product is inferior compared to the other carriers we have flown on to/from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ QF and CX). We can't recommend Delta for business class to/from Sydney."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from Heathrow to Seattle. To be honest I was dreading the flight as I had read some really bad reviews of Delta. But it was excellent. The seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in Economy - with a great selection of films TV shows and music. The food whilst being obviously ""airline food"" was nice enough and lots of it. They listed only one meal - lunch - on the website but they served two more rounds of snacks throughout the flight - an ok sandwich and a really nice calzone. The staff were really friendly as well. Again I was dreading the service as a lot of other reviews mentioned their bad attitude. But the ones on my flight were lovely. Not sure if this is a sign of better things to come from Delta or by the fact that the route is brand new for them but it was a great flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was a bit stubborn about flying Delta for the first time since I'm a fan of Frontier and I don't fly very often about once every three to four years. I took flight 1531 from MSP to BWI and I was very impressed. We left on time and the crew was friendly. After this experience I am very eager to fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK-LHR. Had a great on time flight out of JFK with Delta. I found the service friendly and food was great. Constantly coming through the cabin with refreshments certainly not dehydrated at the end of the flight. Only criticism was when we were coming in to land into London the cabin crew did not ask passengers to raise their closed window blinds which made me feel a little unsafe sitting in the middle seats as I couldn't see what was going on outside during landing. The flight attendant told me after it's not US policy to raise the window blinds Delta why not just make it part of your safety policy. Would fly them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My wife and I fly frequently and over the last couple of years have found ourselves on Delta a couple of times. Each of the prior trips found delays once missing a connecting flight due directly to the incompetence of Delta personnel. I wrote this off I. The past but today is the final straw. We flew from San Antonio to Atlanta to catch a connecting flight to Milan for a long awaited vacation. As we were boarding the 767 in Atlanta I noticed the port engine nacelle was open. Once we were buckled in the captain announced that maintenance was waiting on a part and it would take up to an hour to depart. An hour goes by and they have the part but they can't get it installed. Another hour goes by. They're still trying to fix it. More excuses more delays. Never again Delta this was strike three!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL 1134 PBI-ATL. Great ground experience. Inbound flight late prior to equipment arrival gate agents asked for volunteers to check baggage at no charge to destination to speed up boarding and ease overheads. Turn around was 25 minutes gate arrival-departure. Plane was clean crew greeted boarding passengers with genuine smiles. They assisted loading overheads with no attitude. In flight they chatted with passengers. Crew even made the cart in aisle/trip to lav a pleasant game of I move/you move. I was in a time warp. Flying was fun. Three more flights on Delta that week were routine but what an experience this one flight was."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Our flight from Fairbanks to Minneapolis was a great flight with great service. On our return flights the service was great. However the flight was very hot. Multiple passengers complained and nothing was done on 2 separate flights. Given a choice I will not fly Delta again I didn't appreciate the two four hour sauna flights. I was dressed in sandals shorts T shirt."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On May 22 after a 6-hour delay 5 alerts and us waiting with hope at the terminal flight 5030 to Atlanta was canceled. And as per airport security and Delta counter the flight was canceled due to radar failure. This cancellation caused us to miss our connecting flight to Lima Peru. On same day Delta re-booked flight to Atlanta departing from another airport and for a later time. To get to this airport cost us $175.00. However once at the airport we begged to Delta to get us on a flight to Lima Peru instead Delta personnel there and over the phone made a mockery of our request by pretending to help us when in reality they were just wasting our time. In the meantime our newly re-booked flight was delayed for approximate 3 hrs and we arrived to Atlanta at midnight. Next day on 05/23 we finally traveled to Lima Peru but it was too late. We will never consider Delta for future travel."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Considering how Delta Airlines was an American Air carrier I initially wasn't expecting much and imagined that service would be mediocre sort of like Air Canada but to my surprise my Delta experience was great! Staff were polite the flights were punctual with my returning flight from MSP-YVR being about 15 minutes late due to a computer that needed replacement. Other than the fact that they should really replace/refurbish those A319s my flight was very pleasant."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Travelled MSP-LHR AMS-MSP in May 2014. Flights were on time. Flight attendants responsive enough and food was okay. Economy comfort seats provide decent legroom. I travel with Delta quite a bit and rarely have problems. They get you to your destination reliably for a decent price."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK-LAX on a 757-200 in Business on May 17 angled seats with ample leg room excellent service then onward to HNL on a 757-300 in First: seats comparable to Premium Economy as far as the leg room goes poor recline the service was excellent though large screen IFE good food and drinks. May 25 HNL-LAX on an aged 767-200 in First same poor seat recline but good food and service old-style IFE. May 26 LAX-NYC on a 767-300ER Business Elite outstanding newly refurbished cabin flat bed seats outstanding food and service. The only complaint - never - ending turbulence but that was not airline's fault of course. To sum up Delta's First Class is not worth the money I will stick to premium economy instead in the future and the Business Elite is simply outstanding for a Domestic flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Third long haul flight with Delta LHR-ATL-TPA-ATL-LHR all flights on time first transatlantic flight they run out of food selections so only had pasta left which looked rather unappetising. Good selection of movies and games on the long haul flights seats were comfortable with good legroom. My only gripe is Atlanta airport why do you have to queue to go through security after getting off an international flight to connect with your next plane not Deltas fault but never had to do this before."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LHR-JFK (Virgin) then JFK-DTW with Delta Connection (Returned on the same route and carriers 10 days later. Held up at JFK both ways for 12 hours due to weather not Delta's fault but our return connection to LHR was rebooked without our knowledge due to our late departure from DTW. This resulted in a rush to try and make the connection only to be told we were off the flight and rebooked for the following morning. Delta then did not issue us with the correct tickets resulting in a 4am nailbiter with Virgin check in as they tried to figure our what Delta had done. I am trying to plan my next trip to DTW to avoid Delta connections due to this."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Travelled to London with my mom JFK-LHR via a Boeing 767-400ER on DL 403 which was an evening flight. Everything went very pleasant from food service to inflight entertainment seat comfort and cabin crew as well as cabin cleanliness. My complain would be our return flight which was rather a Boeing 767-300 aircraft. The Cabin was not clean and very narrow bathrooms have some odor and seats were comfortable even for a seven hour flight. Everything else went ok the crew looked exhausted and smiled less they were friendly and very caring. Also to mention food portions are quite small and selections must be thought carefully. If it was not for their 767-300 plane everything went very well. I prefer better other airlines notably American British Airways and Virgin Atlantic as a better option for economy especially with AA's B777-200ER which was their major upgrade."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Very disappointed with Delta Airlines. I try to plan and budget for everything and was very irritated when I checked two bags for $25 each - Delta Advertises on the back of your ticket ""Your first checked bag is always free"" (within their recommended size and under 50lbs checked their website prior to our trip to avoid charges). I don't care if you charge me for my luggage but seriously don't advertise one thing and say another. If you book your tickets 6 months in advance and you pick your seats on that airplane and the plane is empty when you pick them you should at least be able to sit next to your significant other - but don't bother its a waste of time. Pleased with the flight crew and flight attendants kudos to them for positive attitudes. However I don't think I will be flying with delta anytime soon."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Boy are we never going to fly Delta ever again. Our first experience with Delta involved our honeymoon - they overbooked our flight to go to Jackson Hole so they re routed us to a different airport and set us up with a car service to take us to Jackson Hole (this delayed our trip about 5-6 hours and we were driving through Yellowstone Park in pitch black to our cabin). They also gave us Delta vouchers to put towards a ticket for our next flight. So we bought tickets to visit family overseas later with our vouchers and it was the biggest mistake of our lives. Our connecting flight was delayed because of weather- but they just kept pushing the time every 10 minutes making you think you would be able to really make it to our connecting international flight at JFK. We got on the plane 5 hours late and made it to the gate at JFK for our flight about 10 minutes before it was scheduled to depart. Well they didn't let us board the plane because they closed the door already (ok fine they said it was a security issue) so we watched our plane take off without us and mind you its already midnight at this point. So we are directed by the staff to go to the Delta counter so we did that. There was one woman at the desk that was eager to leave and she said that the next flight was overbooked by 16 people (no surprise we noticed that Delta tends to overbook their flights and basically makes people take one of their stupid vouchers just to re-experience Delta again) and that she could put us on a flight with one connection - but we would basically be getting to our destination 3 days later than we were originally supposed to. We are on vacation time off work and are going overseas to a country that is far away to see close family so every minute counts - she handed us what looked to be tickets but later we found out were just itineraries. So we could not go back through TSA to the ""nicer"" part of the terminal where there were comfortable chairs and food because we didn't have official tickets. Panic set in and were stranded at the airport with only 2 stalls available to go to the bathroom and no where to comfortably sit. My mom was able to get tickets for us on the flight that was supposedly overbooked and she was also told that we would get reimbursed for a hotel room should we choose to get one. There were no Delta agents at airport that could help us with anything. We contacted Delta to try to get reimbursed and we were sent in circles no manager available to help etc kept telling us to visit the Delta site and use the number there - even though we already did that they accused us of basically making up the fact that someone told us we would get reimbursed? So after 2 hours of getting no where we were fed up. Many other people I know have had bad experiences with Delta they warned us before we booked with them. I heard many people at the various airports we were at saying they will never fly Delta again and I agree."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","YUL-JFK-NRT-HKG. It was my first time flying Delta. I usually fly Japan Airlines or any other Asian airlines because of all the bad experiences I had with US based Airlines. From the check in agent I was greeted with a big smile. The planes were clean flight attendants full of energy and smile. To my surprise the captain apologize for the slight delay we had from JFK to Narita. That is something you hear only on Asian Airlines. The seats were comfortable for economy and the food was great!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Worst experience ever! Cancelled our connecting flight out of JFK leaving us stranded at their hell hole of a terminal for 20 hours and telling us that the next available flight was almost 3 days later. Employees spent their time sleeping chatting with one another or doodling on notepads. Bathrooms were disgusting. Every employee gave us different and conflicting information or showed no interest in helping us at all. Lost our bag and then told us that they wouldn't ship it to us we had to drive back to our final airport destination and pick it up. I will never fly with Delta ever again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Return leg of a paid first class ticket LAS-ATL-GSO. Seemed like circumstances were lining up to give my wife and I a major headache - Bad weather on the East Coast late (mechanical not weather) departure from LAS tight connection in ATL and no seats ex LAS going anywhere East. Helpful agent and supervisor booked hotel in ATL in case we misconnected but we didn't need to have worried a fine tailwind got us to ATL in time for our connection. Newer planes on these 2 legs; the aircraft on the LAS-ATL leg even had a rudimentary IFE system. However my joy was short lived as my headphone jack didn't work and I was denied the opportunity to watch reruns of a few TV programs. Food was fair (basically the same as the outbound journey) seat comfortable service attentive ground staff throughout helpful and efficient. I'll stick with Delta through this purple patch they are enjoying."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","All flights delayed some due to weather others to ""no staff for flight crew"". Missed all connection flights. Help desk staff extremely rude and condescending especially in JFK. Will never ever fly this airline again. Info given by crew 10 min before landing late regarding new gate and terminal incorrect."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I just tried Delta's ""Business Elite"" from JFK to BOG on a 737-700 and what a ripoff! These ""premium"" seats offer a pitch of just 37 inches (that's less than JetBlue's premium economy); they also recline quite a bit and the result is a wedge experience which made for one of the most uncomfortable flights I can remember. I couldn't even open my computer until my neighbor decided to join his wife in much more comfortable bulkhead coach. Soft service was fine and dinner actually surprisingly good accompanied by a decent German Riesling. But seating comfort is still paramount and this was unacceptable."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The gate experience is good with staff pointing the way. This is especially good at Paris DeGaulle where there are endless gates and lines and confusion. Once on board the experience lessens as the attendants seemingly are frequently tired and occasionally indifferent. I have never been hot (not warm but hot as in a cabin temp of the high 70's) on an overseas flight. A request to a attendant brought the equivalent of a sleepy shrug. The food is edible and the presentation tries to be quality but it falls flat with the quality of the food and the occasional rush to serve and clear. I hate the business class pods - ok for the sleeper or someone doing work but impossible to talk or interact at all with a companion. Baggage handling is excellent for sky priority. Delta clubs vary from seedy (JFK) to nice. Nothing as nice as the Air France clubs at Paris CDG."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Paid for 1st class GSO-ATL-LAS. Delta continues to do a good job in their attempt to be a cut above the other Legacy airlines? Flights were on time check in and boarding easy food good. Service prompt and efficient if not jaunty. The flaw in the program in my view is the age and features of the equipment. DL's policy is to fly them until they run out of hours and our sky veterans had amassed 51 years between them! No IFE on either flight an ugly and not overly comfortable first class seat and 25 year old bathrooms - my ongoing pet peeve with DL."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from YYZ to Detroit to Seoul I was sceptical at first flying Delta because of all the negative reviews. I am very pleased with the whole experience. Enough leg room great entertainment system and great food. I love the snack bags in the middle of the night and bottles of water. Little details really makes a huge difference the ear plug and eye cover warm wipes and cold wipes after boarding and when you wake up. Even the washroom is roomy. Flight attendants are efficient. I will definitely try to fly Delta whenever I can."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew PDX to AMS. Flight departed slightly late but actually arrived early. At check-in I enquired as to whether I could pay to upgrade myself to business class but they said they don't have such a program for last minute upgrades which was rather odd as other airlines regularly do it for a fee. Having said that in many ways I was glad I didn't as my normal economy seat was extremely comfy with loads of personal space. Delta has the best inflight entertainment system I have used with a massive selection of entertainment. Having said that they really need to do something about their meals as they were awful and almost as bad as Air Canada. I didn't eat my main course as it smelt awful food but was supposed to be beef stroganoff. The food was the only thing to let Delta down as their cabin crew were friendly and efficient making sure we had regular supplies of water to keep us hydrated. Id definitely fly Delta again but would order a special meal to see if said meal would be better."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flying to Detroit From Tampa on a 737-800. Service on the plane: it was a good experience. Flight Attendants were polite and cared about me and other passengers (unlike United and BA). Food was only pretzels and cookies and a drink of choice (it was only a 2hr flight). Seats were comfortable. Service in the airport-Good service no long lines and friendly airport crew! I enjoyed Delta and will fly them again!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DCA-ATL-DCA MD-90; Economy. ""We love to fly and it shows"" used to be Delta's slogan. Standards have slipped a lot since then. DCA counter bag drop-off was prompt after online check-in and the outbound flight was on time. It is amazing how many seats they have crammed into this aircraft recently to make money from Economy Comfort seats. The seat itself is reasonably comfortable for about two hours but the reduced legroom is awful. I am average height so I feel for taller people. Both planes were very clean and appeared well-maintained for 18+ year-old aircraft. A drink and mini pretzles were served on both flights. ATL bag drop-off after online check-in was quite quick. The inbound flight was delayed by 75 minutes but they made-up 25 minutes of that lost time. Flight attendants outbound were friendlier than those inbound. Overall this type of service will be acceptable for two to three hour flight segments and I will use Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We flew from Atlanta to Portland the check in process was chaotic and disorganized. We had checked in online but had not printed our boarding passes. One representative told us to leave the line and finalize the check in at the kiosk. We got out of line to do this and the kiosk was out of paper we got back in line and the same rep told us to go back to the kiosk - we refused. There was only one kiosk working at this time! The rep at the counter was much better informed and completed our check in within a couple of minutes. This kind of disorganization caused at least one customer I talked with to miss her flight! In addition there is so little leg room that it is ridiculous and so uncomfortable. I did not feel like the staff were very friendly or helpful. On a positive note our plane landed on time and our luggage was there too."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew MAN-ATL-HNL and LIH-LAX-ATL-MAN in Business Elite/First. Outbound flatbeds on both legs although I found the 'herringbone' 330 better than the 'offset' 767. Food and drink good on both but I noticed that Delta have stopped their wonderful hot nuts on Business Elite (MAN-ATL) but they were still served on First (ATL-HNL). Return LIH-LAX was delayed 3.5 hours due to computer failure at LAX. Delta contacted us (unlike United) so we were able to delay our arrival at Kauai Airport (LIH). The 757 on this route was very tatty with a number of broken footrests and ought to be retired. We made the connection at LAX and ATL and arrived at MAN 30 minutes early. Refreshments on the two First segments were acceptable and excellent on Business Elite. The staff on all flights were very attentive."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight 387 from GUA to LAX on 4/26/2014. Delta procedures at GUA appalling! Each time I fly back on this route things get worse. It appears that you can no longer check in at a counter. After taking our 6 bags to the check in counter we were told to go back to kiosks to do our check in while the Delta employees sat around. If this was a domestic flight I would say there would be no issue. The fact that you have to attempt scanning of passports makes things a bit more difficult especially if you're not used to it. This process took an additional 20 minutes for the 4 of us. As the check in area isn't air conditioned the extra wait time left us sweaty and fed-up by the time we made it to the gate. Plane was late coming in. While waiting in the boarding line we looked to find that 3 of 4 seats had been changed. We went back to the ticket desk at the gate and fortunately were able to get our old seats back. By the time we got onto the plane and took our seats it was apparent that Delta lets babies travel in the first class cabin. The next 6 hours on the plane were frequently interrupted by a two year old that couldn't be controlled by her mother. The flight attendants tried to pacify the child but stopped short of requesting the mother take her child back to economy with the rest of her family. The screaming child aside cabin crew service was great. My four year old was again able to visit the cockpit but found little to do afterwards a this 757-200 only had communal IFE. Either watch the screen in front of the plane or watch nothing else: none of the music stations worked either. Food so-so but drink/snack runs frequent. If a drink/snack was requested in-between nothing was too much trouble. The final act of the Delta ground crew was to bus us to the Bradley Terminal after landing. It took 2 hours from the time the plane landed until we got our bags and I was surprised they were still on the carousel once clearing customs. After all most other international flights come through this terminal. The morning flight always has customs clearance at Terminal 5. If flying Delta was all one had to do it might not be such a bad experience as the flight crews are great. It's the pre post and sometime in-flight policies that Delta management have dreamt up that will make me never fly Delta on this route again. We paid for these tickets as opposed to upgrading so to say we were let down is an understatement. Next time it will be Taca/Avianca."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","May 1 2014 Washington DC (DCA) to Minneapolis St. Paul (MSP). I bought an economy class ticket but Delta gave me an economy plus seat. Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international. It seems as though the smiling CEO on the inflight video has nothing but contempt for his economy class passengers."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight DL0187 Date: Apr 25 2014. More expensive than other airlines. Lunch was served at 10am GMT 2 hours after departure! They had a lot of time to serve it later as we still had more than 5 hours ahead (going to Boston MA USA). You had to pay for entertainment. Many empty seats in first row but you cannot take them without paying extra! Attendant was chatting too much and very loudly and I couldn't sleep. Many broken seats won't come back to straight vertical position. They didn't have any diet or light soda but Fresca."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight 67 to Atlanta connecting to flight 1384 to Orlando on April 28. My mother returned home from Zurich to Orlando after visiting us in Europe. Unfortunately while here she spent time in the hospital. Various Delta employees with whom we were in contact were extremely helpful in rebooking flights and assisting her before during and after her flights including wheelchair support. She enjoyed the flight (in economy comfort) the service the food etc. As a family we have flown Delta during many years and continue to be impressed with the airline more so recently with the many improvements they have and are implementing. We will happy continue to recommend Delta airlines."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Just returned from: IND to SJU via ATL. First class on IND-ATL segments (MD 90) and so-called Business Elite on ATL-SJU segments (737-800). On all segments aircraft interiors were clean and well maintained and cabin attendants were good. Boarding on all flights was total chaos and food on the ATL-SJU segments was inedible. No food on other segments. Seats not what one would call comfortable or roomy. Not worth the price paid."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","April 27th overnight flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Washington Reagan (DCA) with stopover in Detroit (DTW). Economy seats on flight from SFO to DTW were extremely uncomfortable: hardly any legroom - very little padding no padding on armrests and minimal recline. These are the worst airline seats I've experienced. Delta offered a thin blanket but no pillow. I was unable to sleep. The economy seats from DTW to DCA had slightly more recline and were therefore tolerable. Delta didn't offer food for purchase on these flights and I didn't pay the $2.00 for a headset on the SFO to DTW flight so I am unable to rate food or entertainment (I gave Delta one star for each)."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The food was disgusting and the fact that I was travelling from the UK to the USA and there was no entertainment was horrendous. My kids had to look at the front of a seat for 8 hrs and my daughter had to sit on my lap but she could not sit properly because there was no space. When we got given food it kept going everywhere because we were so squashed. The loos were dirty and small. The staff were no good they didn't help out. I wouldn't recommend them."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Atlanta to Seattle. It is a 5 hour flight. If you want to eat you have to buy your meal however they do not have enough sandwiches so when the cart got to the end of the plane there was nothing left. If you want to watch a movie you have to pay $6.00. It costs $30.00 to check each bag. Just be aware that the price you pay for your ticket is just to get you from a to b just like greyhound."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from LAX-ATL on B777-200 then ATL-CMH on A319. Both legs were great and crew very attentive. First class seat on the B777 was a comfortable seat if somewhat difficult to settle into at first. The A319 was uncomfortable and took a while to find that special spot to get comfortable. All considered the service I got for what I paid was excellent. Bags were first off the carousel and waiting when I got there which I liked a lot. Only issue was the miserable check in lady in LAX. DL also need to re think their lounge policy for First class passengers."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","The review is for Delta which was our return flight home from Pittsburgh. We were to leave on Flight DL 5217 on 20 April. Delta Airlines has a poor fleet of plains. They were under staffed and had 2 mechanical breakdowns and were unable to find us other flights. We needed to be home for surgery the next day and paid extra to fly out on Easter. Because we booked with Expedia they said that they Delta was not to blame (they blamed United). Worst case of passing the buck ever! (Only bright spot were the front line staff - like the desk agents who remained 3 hours extra to rebook all the passengers)."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","MAN-Atlanta Atlanta-Memphis Memphis-Las Vegas Las Vegas-Salt Lake City Salt Lake City-Memphis Memphis- Detroit Detroit-Amsterdam April 2014. All of our America trip was with Delta and everyone was excellent in every way. From check in to boarding to seat leg room were superb. The pilot and cabin crew were so friendly the captain thanked everyone on each flight personally standing at the entrance with the cabin crew. 7 out of our 8 holiday flights were with delta and we had no problems with any one was with KLM see that review."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Travelled Dublin to Salt Lake return trip. I normally travel BA which is good but in comparison Delta is a horrible travel experience. The flight attendants are fine but the aircraft used on all four segments were very old and there was a 'domestic' feel to flight that you just don't get with BA which in comparison has newer and cleaner and more spacious aircraft. Perhaps the biggest issue was that Delta typically fly 757 aircraft compared to BA's use of 747 or A380. It just felt far too cramped for long haul. The biggest insult was having paid > $2000 for a return flight to being given a 'beaker' of 100% plonk despite having asked for 'red wine'. I really wanted a glass of wine but if there was a plant nearby I would have dumped it there it was absolutely foul - I'm not a wine snob and would drink anything reasonable but this drink poured from a large container was sickening. I'd fly Delta again but only as a last resort. Having said that the flights were all on time or early maybe lucky but I'd hate to be delayed if the only wine they had onboard in 'coach' was what they gave me on those flights. One more thing although they had VOD the content on offer was very limited with only a handful of movies on offer (in contrast BA usually offer > 30 movies with similar ratios for TV and Music)."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight from Atlanta to Jacksonville NC canceled due to mechanical problem. Their solution was to spend the night in Atlanta at our cost and fly to Jacksonville 20 hours later. Ended up fling to Raleigh and renting a car at our cost and driving to Jacksonville. They are not concerned in the least. Will avoid Delta in the future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight from MSN to LGA going east was very good. Return west was very poor with cancellation of late night flight and re-booking for next morning and long (2.5 hours) delay on morning flight due to a mechanical problem after plane was loaded and de-icing equipment issue in Mid-April at LGA. Very long and stressful flight experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew LHR-JFK and connecting internal flights to MCO. Excellent service at the airport and onboard. Very helpful and friendly cabin crew on all legs of the journey. Planes were clean and comfortable despite being a little old. Flight crews were very informative about potential turbulence flight times etc. There was a good selection of up to date movies and TV series available on personal entertainment screens for the long haul parts. Cabin crew would frequently offer drinks served dinner and a breakfast plus newspapers and other amenities on this section. Punctual and a pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Madison WI to Gainesville FL via Atlanta. Flight delayed by a few hours leaving Madison. There was a decent snowstorm going on at the time and I presumed that was the cause of the delay. Arrived late in Atlanta and just missed the connecting flight to Gainesville. Delta staff at Atlanta said the delay was actually due to mechanical reasons and promptly provided meal and hotel vouchers for an excellent hotel and rebooking on the first flight the following morning. Obviously the delayed flight is a negative but in this particular case Delta efficiently made adequate accommodations for stranded passengers in a situation where it would have been easy for them to blame the weather and refuse to make accommodations at all. For that they deserve some commendation."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Horrible service horrible planes Delta does not care about their passengers. No matter what happens they only have on excuse - technical problems with the plane. I booked my flights with Delta because the price is usually $30-50 cheaper but I've learned my lesson - it's not worth it. (I fly about 10 times a year and have done so for last 6 years) I don't remember their flight being ever on time. They've failed 100 out of 100 times. I wish everyone would stop flying with them just to show them that in order to stay in business they have to take care of their customers."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have flown Delta for 20 years and the last few have become completely horrible. The company does not appear to care about the customer any longer. The seats have shrunk to petite size on most flights and I am fairly thin. My knees are in the back of the seat in front of me when I am in coach. The flights are consistently late on departure and arrival. The flights are typically oversold which creates a capacity issue for their service. As a frequent flyer and a business person I can understand the need to increase operating margins but at what cost? I think the executive team should eat their own dog food and ride non-private flights. I am considering abandoning my gold status at Delta for an airline that can do more than lip service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Booked on Delta flight out of a local regional airport MLI to New Bern North Carolina via connection in Atlanta. Flight was scheduled to depart at 4.59pm. It was pushed back to 7.30 as the incoming flight out of Atlanta has mechanical problems and they were bringing in another plane. Flight delayed a second time to 8.39pm and cancelled. Both at the delay and cancellation the customers had to leave the secure area and go back out to the ticket counter. We were told the flight was cancelled because the crew timed out. All flights on Delta out of Chicago and United were booked. They have no reciprocating agreement with Southwest or U.S. Air and could not see their reservation. Delta told us to come back the next day at 4.50 for that flight. We finally via the internet were able to book a flight earlier the next day out of Chicago with U.S. Air for $400 more than the original ticket. We had purchased insurance through Alliance. Delta would only refund the ticket price and would not pay the difference. The people at the ticket counter were less than helpful they had given up and didn't care. I won't be flying Delta again not if I can help it at least. U.S air was on time and staff was very friendly."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","AF3628 (operated by Delta) Paris-NY JFK 6th April. Extremely disappointed with Delta the only normal element was that the flight was on time. The staff service was not pleasant and not helpful. The lavatory (even before taking off) was dirty. No newspapers (we'll give you whatever will be left after business class passengers have been served). The food was appalling and a horrible non-descript sandwich (which almost everyone put aside) should not be called a ""meal"". What a trip."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I went DTW-SFO AND SFO-DTW. Took Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300 both ways. The seat comfort was great! There was a lot of leg room. The staff wasn't very friendly. They weren't smiling that much or very polite. There was a lot of food selection and prices were decent. We got complimentary drinks twice which was great. The inflight entertainment system has a ton of selection although most of the movies and tv shows cost money. But the music selection was amazing so it was great. Overall the Delta flights were really good and I would definitely fly it again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Extremely dissatisfied with Delta. Original flight delayed with no explanation. Missed connecting flight by 5 minutes. The next flight I was able to get on and still make my appointment at my destination - at boarding time was advised of ""mechanical issues"" and not sure of length of delay. For the price of airfare this lack of service and commitment is unacceptable."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I fly international in economy class from Seattle (SEA) to Japan (NRT) about twice every month. I have flown this route more than 10 times already and with a variety of different airlines. At first I was sceptical about flying with Delta but Delta has made up a lot of ground recently in my opinion. While Delta is no match for Singapore airline's service and no match for ANA's food it does beat out United airlines in both of these categories. One major problem I have with Delta's international flight is that they really only served one meal whereas Singapore and ANA gave you a full 2 meals. Over a 9-10 hour flight having only one major meal feels a little lacking and will leave you hungry walking off the plane. The food that is served is also not exciting but gets the job done. In-flight entertainment is good with plenty of choices and nice screen size/brightness. I fly often so this is particularity important especially over such a long segment. Seat comfort is mediocre but its economy so you get what you pay for however I have used Premium Economy seating with Delta and I'd have to say its worth the few extra $. If flying ANA on this segment on a 787 Dreamliner your Regular Economy seating will outclass Deltas Premium Economy seats however. To rap up I'd say since Delta is usually 100$ cheaper than the other competitors mentioned above you really get what you pay for."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL010 ATL-LHR on 7th March. Very tight connection from Dallas through Atlanta made the flight with minutes to spare and my bags made it onto the flight too! Extremely attentive cabin staff comfortable lie flat bed good selection of food and drink IFE was a little dated but didn't mind as was tired and needed the sleep. Flight arrived early quick bag delivery. All round great experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We had a very good flight from DUS to LAX with transfer in ATL. Service on both flights was good even if meals on the inner-USA flight were not for free."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Our flight from LAX to JFK was on time and we arrived earlier than planned. Service was a little slow due to the reason they don't accept cash payment for meals and Credit Card verification wasn't that fast. Inflight entertainment was really good!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Economy Comfort DTW-LAX on a 767-300 and LAX-DTW on a 737-900. To LAX the 767-300 seat was good although it did not have the adjustable headrest. Multiple drink runs and plenty of cookies peanuts and pretzels. Personal entertainment had okay choices. Back to DTW the 737-900 was great. Seats were very comfortable. Again multiple drink runs and lots of snacks. Purchased the fruit/cheese tray and tapas both of which were very good. The personal entertainment had tons of movies. Overall - very good experience. I hope that all aircraft get seats with adjustable headrests as they do make a difference on a 4+ hour flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew LA to NYC on a red-eye flight this past Sunday March 23rd. The boarding process was an absolute nightmare and that was in part due to some horrible service (more to come). More than 15 people had to check in their bags and all passengers in Economy that could keep their luggage on board were having to put their belongings aisles down in the bins creating a huge mess upon landing. While entering the plane and attempting to put our things away we were ""greeted"" by an extremely sarcastic condescending and ""rudely-friendly"" air hostess who would individually call out any person taking longer than 15 seconds to put away their things. After embarrassing quite a few passengers including myself who were tired and exhausted and about to take a 6 hour red-eye she proceeded to call one passenger ""cute very handsome"" and helped him out by putting his luggage in first class. A few minutes later after everyone else was told to check in their bags a mother came in with a son with special needs stated she had to keep her luggage on board because his medicines and change of clothes were all in there and the hostess proceeded to tell her there's nothing she can do except give her a bag for her medicines. After take-off (which was 25 minutes late) the passengers proceeded to sleep (as one does past midnight) and the air hostesses (namely the sarcastic one) proceeded to talk at full volume inconsiderate of the passengers. As a side note the other hostesses were quite nice. After 6 hours on a rather uncomfortable seat we started our decent with yet again the sarcastic hostess picking out her two favorite passengers and offering them secret mimosas while the rest of us looked on. Not a good experience pretty frustrating and undoubtedly embarrassing."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Paid $622 for so-called Sky Priority First Class from Detroit to Tampa. What a joke! My checked bag was taken off the non-stop because they were overweight. I guess Sky Priority means they ditch your bag before everyone else. Planes are filthy. First class lavatory filthy. First class crowded with coach passengers using forward lavatory. No attempt by FAs to deter this. First overheads filled with coach luggage. Several first class flights last year on AA were terrific also first on Icelandair - also terrific. Save your money - Delta is now a low cost low service airline do not bother to pay for First class."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","3/24/14 I was set to departing from Atlanta to Greensboro NC on flight DL4933 and returning from Greensboro NC to Atlanta on DL1461. Upon boarding I noticed that there was a climate issue on the flight where half of the plane was extremely cold and the back half of the flight was unbearably hot. I was not the only passenger to complain to no avail to the flight staff. After about 30min on the runway with no movement we were notified that there was an engine malfunction and all passengers would need to depart the aircraft. We were told at 8.50am that the maintenance would take an hour at the most. It is now 10.33am and there has been no resolution to the situation. The ladies at the customer care center across from D27 have been the only people to attempt to assist me. I attempted to inform the representatives at the departure gate (D13) that I was attempting to go to a funeral and any options would be appreciated and they stated that they understood and asked me to take a seat and wait. As a result of my flight not being ready to depart Atlanta at 10.40am and the viewing in Winston-Salem NC beginning at 11.00am I was unable to pay my respects."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Washington to London via Atlanta. Flight from Washington to Atlanta was fine drinks service and pretzels provided however bad weather meant the service was suspended. Annoying the flight was full and warnings were given about hand luggage due to the flight being full however quite a lot of other passengers had loads of luggage including massive cases that would normally be checked in. Flight from Atlanta to London was fine meal service delayed due to bad weather but meal was tasty and full drinks service offered. On demand TV with good selection would definitely fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","BOS-ATL-LIM-ATL-BOS in Business Class. Flight experience was excellent. Great crews very comfortable lay-flat bed seating wonderful IFE superb meals. Additionally very good wines offered. I have never had aged wines on a flight before. The return from LIM to ATL was canceled due to a mechanical issue and DL had to fly the part down on their flight from ATL the next day. DL did a commendable job accommodating the over 200 passengers. Excellent pro-active customer service. The only part of this trip that was any type of letdown was the Club in ATL in Terminal E. The Club was packed the seating awkward and uncomfortable the food offerings pretty bad and the Wifi so slow it was unusable. The BOS Club was great however. All in all a very good experience yet again with DL."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Jan 22 from Burlington VT to Tampa FL. They changed planes giving us a smaller one so they ran out of seats they offered compensation took the flight up to Atlanta GA. No heating on plane we were freezing attendants kept there coats on for the trip. No hot drinks peanuts pretzels or soft drinks. Next flight to Tampa was ok on way back the plane land in LaGuardia NY put us onboard waited an 1 hour before leaving while the plane was being de-iced they had only one truck there to de-ice 3 planes. They compensate us with peanuts and pretzels - very disappointed with Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew GSO to CZM through ATL. We received complimentary upgrades to business class. The meal was the best meal I have had on a plane and the sandwich and puree would have rivalled sandwich shops. Everything was excellent. The seats were comfortable and the flight attendants were helpful and courteous. Highly recommend."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Our flight to Tulsa has been delayed for almost 5 hours. During this time we have not been given satisfactory updates. We've only been told mechanical difficulties. 5 hours later they are still trying to decide if they will bring another plane. I will not fly Delta in the future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL1467 13 Mar ATL-SAN. Flight operated with 767 equipment. As with all DL west coast flights medallion upgrades limited to a very few high Diamonds (I am a platinum medallion and was about 17 on the list for 5 upgrade seats). However the Economy Comfort seat was quite comfortable but more importantly the inflight service was superb. Flight time was 4hrs 15mins and the somewhat senior cabin crew provided non-stop service. Two drink runs water in between and a flight attendant always in the aisle. Special requests fulfilled graciously. This was true Delta service from the heart and was to me a benchmark of what DL can be. Even though I am a Million Miler I was impressed by one of the best flights I have had."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DL007 from DXB to ATL. I have traveled this flight 12 or more times. Most of the time my experience is always positive. This specific trip the IFE was not working very well for the first 3+ hours of the flight. They had to reset the system about 4 or 5 times. I was seated in 44J (Exit row window seat). I always sit in Row 44 which is the row with nothing in front of you. I am a frequent flyer so I have this option. The food was decent. The mid flight snack is normally just a turkey sandwich and a mini banana. You can normally get one drink with your meal just ask for it. The flight attendants are very kind every time on this flight. Sometimes you get a joker too. The bathrooms always become quite disgusting but that's understandable on a 15 hour flight. I enjoyed my flight but will be flying Business class with my miles next flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew CZM to ATL. We were supposed to leave on 28th January but didn't end up leaving until 30th January. This obviously wasn't the airlines fault so you cannot give them a worse score for the weather. We were complimentary upgraded to business class on this flight but since the plane had landed the night prior they didn't have the hot meal we received on the way down. They did however give us all the cookies and chips and any other snacks they had. Along with liquor. The seats were very comfortable and the flight attendants were very courteous. Overall a great flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Rochester to Ft Lauderdale through Atlanta 3/6/14 - 3/9/14. I was very happy with two aspects and unhappy with one. We taxied from the gate in Atlanta found there were tornadoes in Florida and turned back to the gate. The speed with which we were told what happened and with which Delta decided to bring us back to the gate were beyond anything I've recently experienced from the airlines. I was very impressed with the kindness and quick solution when I got home after the trip realized I left a book on the plane called the airport held it for me and I got it back two days later. My one complaint was with the one hour line to get through TSA at 5 am March 9 in Ft Lauderdale-I think Delta blames this on TSA. Overall very satisfied with Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","PHL-CDG-PHL on a Boeing 757ER. Went on a family vacation to Paris back in July 2013. Leaving Philly the flight left on time at 9pm and got to Paris 30 minutes early around 10.15am. Flight wasn't full so I went to an empty row to lay down for the almost 8hr flight. Each seat had TV's in the headrest and the plane had wifi but flying over the Atlantic ocean the wifi didn't. The food served wasn't the best and the complimentary breakfast was a joke they gave us OJ a banana and a blueberry muffin. Leaving Paris we had an hour delay because of a storm and when we finally boarded the plane we had another half hour delay because a family of 10 had a virus and were all forced to get off. My original seat flying from Paris was changed without any notification prior to the vacation. Luckily my mother checked the flights each day to make sure nothing bad happened to our flights. The flight was full minus the family who got kicked off the plane. For the almost 8hr flight you would think they would use a 2 aisle plane instead of one. My TV didn't work. For long haul flights I doubt I'll take Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Feb 25th flight DL4884 DL4938 / March 4TH DL5355 DL892 DL4682. I had not ever flown with Delta before last week. I have been very impressed with the customer service as well as the price. Atlanta airport was daunting first time round but the second visit was much easier to work through."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight 2395 PBI-LGA on a MD-88 aircraft on July 30th. Only positive was an on time flight. Thankful this flight wasn't any longer then it was. Experience was awful and I felt very unwelcome as if I was an inconvenience. Flight crew were young and seemed new to the airline industry. I assumed they'd be into their job and enthusiastic I experienced the complete opposite. No hello or goodbye while entering and deplaning the aircraft by any crew member. Ticket scanner while boarding was not working so the rude gate agent was checking the tickets by hand. Crew rushed through the safety announcement and we were in the air within 5 minutes. Ok legroom however the armrests where painful to rest your arm on. Restrooms in rear were out of order leaving everyone on the plane to have to all use the one restroom in first class. Took about 30 minutes to receive my luggage at baggage claim. Overall not a pleasant experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have flown Delta for years because I live in metro Detroit. I am a frequent flyer and am in many ways ""stuck"" but after this experience I am going to find an alternative. I am sure my business does not matter however I think if one person tells one other and so on perhaps customers can have a voice! It is a shame that people cannot be treated better!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","CDG-MIN-DFW - great service - nice staff - managed to get me and my luggage in an 1 hour connection (got on the plane 15 min before take off)."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was travelling with my teenage son and 3 others on a flight to Boston. We received excellent service from everyone. The attendants encouraged our tall teenage boys to move to seats with more legroom as the flight was not full and supplied them with all the refreshments they asked for with a smile. They gave us great advise for when we landed. Extra cups of tea were not a problem and also came with delicious cookies! Our return flight a week later was even better with the same crew who were interested in our trip and how we had got on with the snowstorms. They again encouraged us to move for more room and once again all refreshments were served with a smile."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Long and short of it is that it took a succession of 5 aircrafts last week to get from Detroit to Burlington VT. The first plane which left on time backed into a baggage cart. They couldn't find a crew for the replacement. Ended up spending the night in Detroit (at my expense) the 1st and 2nd aircraft the next morning both had mechanical issues. Customer Service in Detroit for the most part is the worst I've ever seen. Rude uninformed incompetent etc. Thanks to a fellow passenger who told me that a flight to Burlington had 14 empty seats I got home on aircraft #5. I usually fly Delta and have generally found their service to be very good. However they need to address the Customer Service issues in Detroit."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from Seattle to Vegas on a ""cosy"" CRJ900. Service was friendly seat comfortable and snacks and drinks on offer were good for a 1hr 45min. Flight and bags were first on the carousel easily worth the extra $70 IMO."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL002 London Heathrow to JFK 15th Feb returned on 21st Feb flight KL6005 JFK to London Heathrow. This is the first time I have used Delta Airlines. The value for money was great. The meals were some of the best I have tasted inflight with a good selection. The entertainment was also extremely good with a vast selection to choose from. The staff were not warm and friendly and the plane was not cleaned to a great standard there were peanuts down the side of the chair that had been there for some time. The staff did not know who their partnership airlines were and we were advised to go to a different terminal due too this. Flying home from JFK seats were not allocated until the gate meaning on a night flight my daughter was on the opposite side of the plane to myself."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Feb 7 2014. Frankfurt (Germany) to NYC (USA). All in all I had one of the best long distance flights in a while. The plane itself was new leg space was a lot better than for instance on Air Berlin flights. The safety video was the funniest I had seen. Delta definitely had the greatest selection of films I have seen on the plane although some of them had Russian/Chinese/Korean subtitles but I wasn't disturbed by that. I know a flight is not all about food but I was surprised by the variety of things served. The crew were generally very friendly and served the first round of drinks approximately an hour after take off followed by snacks (pretzels and salted peanuts) a fantastic hot lunch (chicken/rice/vegetables) and tea/coffee straight afterwards. The next round of snacks (same than before) was served a few hours later and 1.5 hours before landing we even got another meal this time a hot tomato-mozarella sandwich followed by ice-cream. I would certainly recommend flying with Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","After visiting Tucson AZ I was embarking on my return journey from Tucson to Edinburgh via Atlanta and Paris on Monday 17th Feb. The incoming flight from Atlanta arrived more or less on time but as soon as it landed it was clear there was a problem with the aircraft. It turns out that none of the lavatories were functional. This caused a severe delay making me reschedule my entire journey one day later. I was offered a hotel - which was fine - and given what was described to me as meal vouchers. These were not fine. They were in fact practically useless pieces of paper. No one took the time to explain that they were only valued at $6. A fact I was also unaware of until I came to pay and pay I did. As far as I am concerned if I am given a meal voucher I expect a meal. In fact this worthless piece of paper does not buy anything on the menu - even a bowl of soup. To add insult to injury there was no breakfast voucher at all. American airlines already have a bad reputation so perhaps I should not have expected better."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Was scheduled from Milwaukee to Detroit to Norfolk VA on Thursday 2/13. Our plane in MKE was delayed over an hour because of weather. Because of that we missed our connection to Norfolk. The captain said we'd be rebooked on the next flight - we weren't. My three traveling companions and I couldn't be rebooked until Saturday 2/15 after our event was over. Delta's customer ""service"" area in the Detroit airport consist of a bank of phones with no human beings present. We were continually bounced between phone representatives and gate agents with neither being helpful. We ended up renting a car and driving (yes over 12 hrs) Avoid Delta at all costs."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL 1169 MIA to LAX Feb 13 2014. It is impossible to get an upgrade as a Platinum Medallion between Florida and California on Delta. In addition the system wide upgrades are never available. Furthermore the planes are smaller always packed. After flying 2.5 million miles with Delta it clearly has gone downhill. Loyalty means nothing. If you fly from Florida to California often and need to try and do some work on the trip avoid Delta. Their upgrade policy is a classic bait and switch. My trip yesterday was like a 5 hour closed MRI. It is sad to see great airline go down the tubes in rewarding loyalty."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","February 1 2014. CDG (Paris) to SEA (Seattle-Tacoma). I would have given Delta a higher score an 8 out of 10 for trip satisfaction but the seats on the aircraft were very uncomfortable (the worst I've experienced). The recline was minimal which made it impossible for me to sleep. I had to remove the catalogue / inflight magazine from the seat pocket in front of me in order to gain a 1/2 inch or so of leg space. I considered upgrading to economy comfort but only available seats were by the toilets and the seats were described as having ""up to"" 4 inches of additional leg room but no mention of additional recline. The seats are acceptable short flights but not for long-haul travel."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I recently flew to Fort Wayne from Philly. Both ways had a lay over so I flew 4 separate planes. Of the 4 I had a broken seat on 3 of them. Not able to recline on 2 because it was broken and the other I had a broken seat cushion that repeatedly slid off making the flight that much more comfortable as I had to keep standing and fixing it. At least I was able to enjoy a beverage. Oh no I was not because 2 flights did not serve any and the last leg of my journey the 3 flight ""attendants"" were unable to fully serve the plan in the 70 min we were in the air. I have taken 20 min flights in Europe where I get served fresh tea and a biscuit by one flight steward for the entire plane. If ever have the displeasure of flying your airline I will be sure to bring duck tape a tool box and a coke so I can be comfortable."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","ATL-DUB Delta 176 in business class leaving Atlanta on November 22 and returning November 30 Delta 177. The food was fantastic and filling. I liked the fact that there was a great selection of entrees both for the main meal and the meal prior to landing. The seat sort of reminded me of L'Espace Affaires on Air France in 2007. That said it was very comfortable. The only downside is that I was unable to sleep. The flight crew going to Dublin was nothing short of fantastic. The flight crew returning was great but not as good as the outgoing crew. The in- flight entertainment was OK. While I didn't explore as much on the outgoing flight I was able to watch 3 movies I had not seen on the return flight. The only real downside is that it cost me nearly double the frequent flier miles to fly for free than it had cost me when I flew Delta to Dublin in 2000. All in all a very positive experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Wife and I flying from Memphis Tenn. to Edmonton Alberta. Released from the Memphis hospital (after a stroke) on Sunday flying home the next day. When we booked the flight we requested we sit together due to my need for assistance. Reply ""No problem"" get to the airport check in we are in the same row. but her on one side of the plane I am on the other 2 people and 1 aisle between us. We explained the situation to the clerk they said ""No problem we will fix it at the gate."" Result - back seats in the plane no recline at all very limited space."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from DUB-JFK-PHX. The transatlantic leg was enjoyable. The flight attendants did several drink runs although they only pour half a can unlike other airlines. Each passenger had their own personal backseat TV and the movie/music/game selection was fantastic. Headphones are provided for those didn't bring their own. Toilets were clean and hot towels are provided to freshen up. The second leg from JFK-PHX was less impressive. Entertainment is provided by an old CRT monitor in the centre of the aisle meaning you have no choice in what you watch. Expect old sitcom reruns. No meals on this flight either despite it being nearly as long as DUB-JFK. The boredom of this flights combined with my hunger meant I couldn't wait to get off. Conclusion: fly Delta transatlantic but avoid for domestic flights within the USA."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew JNB-ATL-SNA on Feb 6 2014. Departure from JNB on time though boarding was a bit chaotic. Economy class seating on B77L from JNB-ATL ok. Weber slimline seats are a quite firm and this becomes ever more evident on this long 16 hour flight. Cabin crew most unfriendly and really did not want to be providing the on board services. In flight meals very poor. Cabin crew on ATL-SNA flight a little better. AVOD on B77L very good with excellent picture quality and selections."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have flown Delta 3 round trips in the past 3 months. The first flight had an engine problem over the Atlantic and we had to make an emergency landing in Canada and were forced to sit on the plane for 6 hours waiting for a new plane. I do have to say the crew was great. Missing my connection I arrived home a day late. My second flight was normal with no issues. My trip had another engine problem. This time before take-off. Instead of getting home on Friday night I had to wait until Saturday night to get home. The crews and ground staff have been great but Delta is not maintaining its planes."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Honolulu to LA First class. Lucked out got a flight that was inbound from Japan so configuration was Intl business. Normally Hawaii routes get the oldest planes with the least amount of comfort. This was a wonderful surprise. Complemented by a wonderful crew that was eager to please with warm excellent service this flight was a pleasure. Great entertainment nice lunch warm service and tail winds."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","BKK-NRT-BKK in Business Elite on B747. Don't fly Delta much and was impressed with the product. Seats comfortable and private whilst seated on upper deck. Cabin ambience pleasant service attentive and professional IFE above average. In general a cut above the other American carriers and significantly better than the previous Delta international business product. Only disappointment was not having Premium Lane cards for arrival in BKK. BKK can have lengthy immigration queues and all major carriers provide this 'fast track' card which is a must when arriving into BKK. I enquired about it with the crew and they were baffled and seemed to have no idea with what I was talking about as if they had never heard of it. Other than that very nice experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","January 15th SLC to CDG. I would have purchased an economy comfort seat for the extra $210 but the only available ones were by the toilets. My economy seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have experienced on a long flight - inadequate seat padding and very limited recline. Otherwise the flight was acceptable the food edible the FAs competent performance on time. Next time I fly to Europe I'll avoid Delta on account of my experience with the uncomfortable seat. Based on my experience on this trip I would not recommend Delta to friends and family. I may fly Delta again but only on short domestic trips."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","GSO-BKK and return via ATL and NRT. All flights on time and no issues with check in and boarding. All the long distance flights were on 747-400. Although you can no longer call these the ""Queen of the Sky"" they still give a comfortable reassuring ride. Delta can be complimented on upgrading their business class product. The fully flat bet is good. The duvet pillows amenity kit (no pyjamas!) and IFE are all excellent though the noise cancelling headset had connection issues on all flights. To compete with the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers though Delta needs to brush up on a few areas. In particular the menu selections and service need to be better but my biggest gripe is with the bathrooms which fully reflect the 25 year age of the plane and at the end of a 13 hour flight. I shall say no more."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","SIN-NRT return. DL 622 and DL 621. Both flights were on 777-200ER equipped with on demand ptv. SIN-NRT: Could not find the USB port to charge my phones on the flight to NRT. Hot breakfast was served at local time 8 am 2hrs into the flight. Hot snack of chicken wrap was served 2 hrs before landing. The odd part was the entertainment programmes were switched off 4 hrs into the flight with no explanation. Most passengers were asleep due to the early departure of the flight at 5.45 am. NRT-SIN: USB port was installed beside the PTV. Hot dinner was served 2 hrs into the flight. Snack of ice cream were served 2 hrs before landing. Crew of Chinese national and Singaporean crew were helpful. Asked if passengers wanted extra ice cream. Self help galley provided Evian water only. DL offers the cheapest fare for direct flights to Japan and will travel with them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","While the flight attendants on all the Delta flights were nice I've noticed the planes they use aren't the best of quality/maybe not well maintained and their customer service seems non-existent. On a flight I took recently from Moscow to NYC during both take off and landing the roof of the plane was leaking a lot of water (over passengers). If you were sitting in a window seat (like me) it seemed to leak quite a lot enough to get you wet. The leaking eventually stopped when the plane was higher up in the air. The flight attendants couldn't really do anything about it since it was an issue with the plane itself. I left bad feedback on the flight and filed a complaint and Delta never seems to respond. So next time I fly I will probably read more reviews on air carriers and try to pick one that's known for better service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","ATL-LAS December 2013. Main and pretty much only issue was legroom. In certain configurations of their 757-200 seats 2C/D are bulkhead seats where we were seated and legroom is severely restricted. Other than that it was a pretty average/decent experience. A snack basket containing the typical peanuts pretzels and chocolates was passed around twice. Flight attendants were courteous. The seat had a good amount of width and AC power outlets were available underneath. PTVs were also available with an excellent selection of holiday and other films. Since the flight departed around 9:30pm no complimentary dinner was served. All in all it was an OK flight just beware of the first class bulkhead seats on certain 757 configurations."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew on December 19 DEN-ATL-SRQ and return all flights were on time even with all the delays in the NE. One flight had PTV's on a 757 which was very nice other 3 flights on a md's nicely updated with power outlets in economy comfort which was very nice. Greeted nicely at each gate by name. All staff very professional and better than Delta or American without a doubt!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew LHR-CUN (via ATL outbound and MSP return) in Business Elite. Pre-flight customer service (via Twitter) was excellent with the one or two queries we had. Check-in fast track security and lounge at LHR T4 very good - much better than BA at T5. Seats (flat beds) very good although foot area a little compact - we're 5'6 and 5'8 so taller travellers may be less happy. Pillow and duvet very comfortable. Food needs more investment - not terrible but not brilliant. In flight entertainment terrific but both our screens skipped and jumped on both legs (we were generously and quickly compensated for this post flight - excellent). Lack of lounge at CUN a bit disappointing on the return. We encountered many Delta staff on the journey - all are a cut above most airlines for the personal human touches. They genuinely engage. On board service excellent and friendly - on the outbound flight two crew (including the purser) came round with chocolates and thanked us for flying Delta they really sounded like they meant it. Will definitely fly Delta transatlantic again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL1954 on 12/30 and DL1910 on 1/1/14. Checking in with first class with Delta was nice because we got advanced security clearance. The rest was disappointing. I guess I am used to first class with American. Snacks offered were like sombody's left over Halloween treats. There was no music or entertainment offered."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from JFK to Las Vegas January 9-12. Check-in was very good even at 6am. I liked the bistro in the waiting area. The plane was clean and orderly. The only real disappointment was the food and drink selection offered with the flight a tablespoon of peanuts or a shy dozen of mini-pretzels. The real disappointment (inflight) was with the entertainment as in none. The screen was jumping (and audio) as if the VCR was old and the screens had rainbow colors to them as if the TV's were well past their prime. Ok no problem I'll listen the music channels nothing not one channel other than the one tied into the screen. I was told by the flight attendant that they no longer offer it. For $600+ a seat it should be a lot better especially since last year was a banner year for profits for the airlines. How sad. This is America's best? Hey Delta pay it forward and invest in your equipment."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Used Delta from JFK to Fort Lauderdale and have to say that the experience was far from first class. Before takeoff a lady got on in a dishevelled state and distributed bottled water after she had stowed her luggage in an overhead locker. It turned out she was an off duty stewardess helping out the on duty staff. During the flight drinks were served and a banana was thrown to the first class passengers by way of food. The only good thing to be said was that the flight was on time."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My husband and 1 year old daughter was flying today (01/11/2014) from Charlotte to Albany through Detroit. Their flight got delayed 1 hr due to some mechanical repairs. Then they missed their connecting flight to Albany due to that delay. They ended up waiting from 12 Noon to 8pm for their next flight to Albany. By 8pm their flight got cancelled and got a new schedule for tomorrow. With connecting flight from Detroit-Atlanta-Albany. I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. This type of incident happens for us for the third time. Very bad service of flights."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","SIN-NRT-SIN. Economy. Delta may fail to meet expectation of many people who fly within the States but for international flight I find they do pretty well. The flight for both legs was on time and actually arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. I love their B777-200LR. I understand that Delta is an American airline so the seat was designed for a typical Caucasian. Thus the seat appears bigger and gave me more than enough space for the size of a typical Asian without upgrading my ticket. Meals were nice with various choice of beverage. There were a lot of choices for IFE from movies to music. Flight attendants were quite nice and helpful. The only minus point probably is long process of check-in at Changi (my bags were checked 3 times before boarding) which I understand due to fear of terror on flights to the US. Overall it was still a good experience especially the first time with Delta. I would definitely fly with them again for my trip to the USA some time in the future."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flying round trip from Columbus OH to Las Vegas through Detroit. Jan 3-6 2014. Delta gate agents are rude and abrupt. They were late getting me to my connection in DTW due to computer problems during boarding at the gate in Columbus. I made it to the gate in DTW 12 min before departure but the agent had given away my seat and said sternly that it was to late and to go complain at gate A43. I did and they told me to call customer service. I did that and they said they cant do anything because I need to talk to a gate agent. They gave me the run around and really did not care. Flying home was more mechanical problems. I wound up having to sleep in DTW airport. No hotels available. When I boarded flight DL6121 the agent was slow. I fly for work and will no longer fly Delta. The ground crew and flight crew were all great and concerned for the safety of the passengers. The gate agents lack any general concern for customers safety comfort or well being."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew from LAX to Haneda (12/22/2013) and from Narita to LAX (12/29/2013). Flights were on time in fact earlier than scheduled. Flight attendants were very courteous not typical of attendants of United States airlines. The online check in and baggage drop center that takes baggage more than 3 hours before flight time make travel a breeze."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew during the chaos caused by the weather the delays wer understandable. Leaving mass the staff at Logan assisted me with my sick child by being attentive and making us as comfortable as they could. When we stopped in JFK again the staff were very pleasant while we waited 3 hours to board to Dominican Rep. Staff did what they could to keep passengers entertained. On the other hand I feel like customer service stops in the US while in the Dominican Rep I felt like I was dealing with a whole different airline. staff were rude and inconsiderate. Delta needs to take time to train their Dominican staff."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I was on this flight which was delayed by over 2 hours in Atlanta and never once were we given the reason for the delay. That's fine. A delay is a delay. Here is where it gets interesting. Once we boarded this old DC plane the cabin crew promptly made an announcement that they had ""forgotten"" to load water to the tanks. So even though the flush would work there would be no water from the faucets to wash our hands. Instead there was just a bottle of water kept in the toilet. Yes that was my Delta experience! I met another traveler in Mexico a few days later who apparently flew the same flight two days later and had the same water issue. This really explains why I should avoid Delta in the future! Absolutely no customer service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Economy Comfort Manila to Tokyo Narita. The extra $39 is well worth it. Much more peaceful cabin and priority boarding. The extra recline and seat pitch really made a difference. Flight attendants anticipated the needs of passengers. consistently offering snacks and refreshments. they were very courteous and tried to address the concerns of passengers as best they can. I also appreciated the fact that they took the extra effort of addressing me by my name. It was very thoughtful of them."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL0117 on 12/29/13 STR to ATL on 767-300ER. 1x2x1 config in Delta's premium cabin remains unbeatable service levels w/Delta generally consistent. This flight even surprised on the upside: excellent menu out of STR and a top notch cabin crew. Is it a throw back to times past when an attendant cares to monitor your Scotch remains 'easy ice' i.e. bring an additional ice cube when needed and without being prodded? That was a crew that made it a joy to fly over the Holidays. Delta wins on many levels these days."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","New Orleans to Boston. A blizzard was headed for the Boston area and delays were expected. Was charged $100 because my luggage was 2.3 lbs over weight. I asked a man working at the ticket area to help me transfer to an earlier flight in order to beat the storm. He told me he would put me on standby and directed me toward a gate. Lady at the gate told me I'd have to wait an hour till she could answer any of my questions. Went back to the desk an hour later and told that the man at the check in desk must have made a mistake and that I had not been put on standby. Lady then put me in standby and told me she would call my name if a seat opened up. Everyone began to board the flight and my name had not been called just as they were closing the gate the lady yelled at me to get on the plane. Ran down the ramp. Flight staff were OK landed a little early. Things went much smoother in Atlanta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Florida to Seattle flights delayed due to weather and would miss connection in Atlanta. Understandable. Ticket agent wanted to send me to Atlanta and sit on standby. Whereby I was not guaranteed a seat and no hotel meal compensation. Had agent book me on flight early next day instead. Booked seat from Florida to Atlanta but no seat booked from Atlanta to Seattle by agent and now on standby. Tried to assign seat over internet but was blocked because agent put me on standby. Called Delta and was informed that the airport agents now had control and could not book a seat. Told telephone agent to let me speak to supervisor as I was looking at 25 empty seats on their website. Agent spoke to supervisor and supervisor assigned me a seat. Now why couldn't other agent have done that hours earlier? Arrived at baggage check-on area (already had boarding passes) for ""red-eye"" return trip from Seattle. Stood in line watching understaffed agents for 20 minutes and was told when we finally got to the front of the line that we had missed the baggage check-in window by 3 minutes. Keep in mind we had already stood in line 20 minutes. Told to go to the Special Services line. Got in Special Services line and stood for 15 minutes. By now not only had my wife and I missed checking our bags but we had now missed the flight. Told by ""red coated"" Supervisor is that all they could do was put us on standby for a 11.25 pm ""red-eye"" flight with no guarantee we could even get on the plane as there were no seats available. As we pointed out how long we stood in their lines the ""red coat"" got surly and told us that this was our only choice. She would not help us with a room or meals. We asked about a trip the next day which she booked us on that left at 11.45 am. Now 13 hours later. When we asked where we could find a hotel she pointed the directions to the hotel board center and basically said we were on our own. The last straw was they lost our baggage on the return flight. Finally came in on the next flight after midnight next day."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","2 hours flight between Atlanta and Nassau. Business class ticket. Very old and noisy aircraft (MD88). Business class seats OK. Sky Priority boarding. Except bananas and bretzel and drinks do not expect any meal served at dinner time even for a 1500 USD ticket. No lounge access for this international destination except if you have the right frequent flyer status. I will avoid to fly them again for this amount of money."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We made reservations way in advance prepaid our flights and chose the seats that best accommodated our needs. Delta then changed the flights on several occasions and reassigned our seats giving us the worst possible seating even having our kids separate from us. We called customer service and were told they could not do anything that they are not allowed to change other people's seats. That is exactly what they did to us! We learned our lesson the hard way and we hope to never have to fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I recently took a trip from Huntsville AL to OKC from Nov 21-Dec 27th. I found my first flight to be a very pleasant experience but what impressed me was how my return flight was handled. We were late I was due to depart at 3.30 and by the time I checked in it was 3.21. I was booked on the 6.10 flight right then and there. The staff didn't even charge a fee for having to change my flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","To Las Vegas from Jacksonville Florida. The plane we were on from Atlanta to Las Vegas a long flight had no leg room and there were two large men and me in a row! On the way back from Las Vegas we knew right away that our flight was going to miss the connection. I called Delta to try to get a connecting flight worked out and was on hold for around 45 minutes. Never did get it worked out over the phone. When we arrived in Atlanta they told us to go to a kiosk to find out what they had decided to do with us and a series of coupons came out. One for 25.00 of food (everything was closed) and a coupon for a hotel. On the flight back at 8 that morning the plane was packed and it looked like most had had the same kind of night we had. There were three stewardesses in the back of the plane talking so loud it kept waking everyone up. They did not provide a beverage service because of turbulence so they were non stop until I pushed my button and told them they were disturbing everyone. The girl was very rude and we heard her tell the other two we are talking too loud for the wonderful passengers out there! And went right back to their discussion."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","BOS-AMS-BOS Dec 2013. I don't know when they put the upgraded Airbus 330s into service but it's as good as any business service I've seen on a US carrier. 1-2-1 seating so if you're by the window you're not trapped if the person next to you is in full recline mode. In the usual 2-2-2 format I've always avoided the window but on this service the window seat at 9J worked very well. The seats are on the narrow side for business but you get an individual pod that's narrower in the front (where your feet go) wider in the back; the seats have full recline. Cabin staff on both flights were senior attentive and friendly. On AMS-BOS the genial captain came back before take-off to chat up everyone in business individually. I only used the A/V to track flight progress but the screen is large and pops out of the pod wall. The pillow was comfortable. The amenities kit is about average - the usual socks etc. but nothing special and they don't offer the business amenity that my wife really likes - PJ''s."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers. Recommended airline but there are a lot of other better options in my experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Newark to LA via Minneapolis. I arrived at Newark airport with plenty of time before my flight was due to leave. I was then told via the computer alert system that my flight was one hour delayed. After a one hour delay I was allowed to board the flight. We then proceed to sit on the runway for another hour and as a consequence I missed my connection. Once I landed in Minneapolis I was told (very abruptly and rudely) that I had missed the flight and was told to then search for my new boarding pass in amongst a sea of boarding passes of others who had also missed their flights because handing them out individually would have been too easy and maybe make sense? I then proceeded through the airport to the baggage reclaim and customer information area where I asked the Delta airlines representative whether there was any available food for people who had missed their flights. She told me that if I wanted something to eat I had to order a pizza. Last but not certainly not least when I was finally able to pick up my rucksack from the Delta ""office"" I was wearing a sling due to a shoulder injury. Delta staff in the office watched me struggle to pick up my backpack for around ten minutes before finally I actually had to ask them for help. I must say though through all my complaining I had two okay stewardesses on that flight however the rest of the Delta staff were rude and inconsiderate."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DAL 417 LAX to SYD and DAL 16 from SYD to LAX. Both legs on Delta's 777-200LR in seat 7A. Used kiosk for check-in at both LAX and SYD. The Delta ""business class"" lounge at LAX is nothing more than Delta's normal ""Sky Club"" the facility was overcrowded and like being inside an extremely loud bar. The flights pushed back pretty much on time. Delta's 777-200LR is getting a bit worn looking and the herringbone ""suites"" that face away from the windows (as opposed to the much-better window-facing suites used by carriers like Cathay Pacific) had walls so low that privacy was minimal. I was lucky enough to have seat 7A on both flights; 7A has the advantage of having a closet next to the seat which in effect forms a cave that the seat reclines back into. The set-up is very good for allowing sleep. The flight crews were LA-based both directions seemed to be made up of senior FA's and on balance did a really nice service both directions. The flights featured three meal services - dinner/lunch a mid-flight snack and a light breakfast. The forward and mid galleys had a variety of low end snacks available throughout the flight. The AVOD system is OK (screen sizer and location) but nothing special but it does have available a fairly broad selection of movies. The best part of the flights was my ability to sleep. I am a large guy and I've had real trouble trying to sleep in the flat-bed first and business seats used by British Air Cathay Pacific and Qantas. Delta was a refreshing change. I got 7-8 solid hours of quality sleep time on both flights. Part of the reason is that the FA's move the meal service process along efficiently and get the cabin lights down early into the flight. On arrival although Delta offers BusinessElite passengers a fast-track immigration/customs pass I didn't use them because as a TSA Global Entry cardholder I was able to use the kiosks in both Sydney and LAX. As I only had carryons the total time from plane until I was out of the airport could not have been more than 10 minutes. In the past I've normally flown on Qantas to/from Australia and New Zealand but with Delta's codeshare arrangement with Virgin Australia (an excellent carrier by the way in all respects) and given my outstanding recent experience on Delta's 777 I plan to continue using Delta for my travel to/from Oceania."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","MNL-NRT-JFK (B744/Premium Economy) EWR-ATL(A319/Y) ATL-SNA (B757/Y) SNA-MSP (A319/Y) MSP-EWR (A320/Y) and JFK- NRT-MNL (B744/Y). In general all my flights departed on schedule and on certain occasions even arrived at my destination ahead of schedule. I can safely say that since the last time I flew DL about 2 years ago I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of service. Overall flying experience was very pleasant. Although a lot of the cabin crew are senior I found most to be a lot nicer compared to the grumpy ones in the past. One noticeable improvement was upon boarding. The boarding gate staff are all friendly with special mention to the ones in ATL and JFK T4. They make it a point to greet all passengers by name and with genuine smiles. I was quite impressed by the staff at JFK T4 who took extra time to guide me through the check-in process using the kiosks. They were very helpful and not in a rushed manner. In-flight food on the long-haul flights were decent enough. For the short-haul flights I was able to have as much nuts and pretzels as I want. IFE was pretty good with and easy interface and lots of options to choose from. I thought of trying the premium economy seats and though I'm 6'0"" tall and a little on the heavy side I still didn't find it of much value considering the add-on fee. I really didn't feel much of a difference compared to regular Y. I also found the new seats to be slightly more comfortable and didn't feel as cramped as before. Moreover I've been lucky enough to have entire rows of 3 to myself on most of the flights I took particularly the long-haul ones. It took a bit work checking seat assignments on a regular basis but the effort was well worth. Not only did I get a whole lot of extra space and privacy but extra TV monitors pillow and blankets as well. Much much better than premium economy but at no extra cost. It was an overall pleasant experience flying DL this time."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew DL7 Dubai to Atlanta. Excellent service from staff. Yes I am short so I fit into the sleeper seat and yes if I were taller it would not be a good fit. Screen on entertainment is adequate. Staff was warm attentive and friendly."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We left unreasonably early (6 hours ahead) to drop off our rental car and to accommodate the weather. While on route to the airport Delta left a voicemail that our flight was delayed so we would miss our next flight home. He looked up another potential flight and asked if we were able to make it to a flight that should have been boarding as we spoke. So it seemed unlikely that we would make it but it was delayed. So we rush to get to that flight make it to our next stop and are now hours early for our next flight. We head over to Delta and ask if there is any way possible to leave on an earlier flight home because it was not in our plan to be so early and sit at an airport for 5 hours. They could not accommodate us for an inconvenience that was not our fault without an extra charge of one hundred dollars. I'm not satisfied with my service from Delta Airlines to say the least."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I had to make a last minute trip (same day round-trip) to SFO from LAX on 12/12/2013. I have not flown in economy in years except for Southwest but chose Delta as their price was much lower than Southwest (first class not worth it for this short of flight in my opinion): I booked this trip 10 days in advance. While these flights are branded as Delta they are operated by Compass. I must say that this is an excellent product! My flight to SFO which left at 7.00am left on time and arrived early. In addition a light breakfast snack was served. This flight was half full so I asked for and was given an extra snack to take with me. This kind gesture saved me from having to purchase lunch later. The flight back left SFO at 5.00pm and arrived back on time. This flight was full but the same professional service was received. That being said a snack and drink service helped make a really long day end well. These flights are operated by EMB 175 planes and there are no middle seats only window or aisle. Besides the great price service and on time performance I would recommend this trip as there are assigned seats and clearing security at the Delta terminals in LAX and SFO is much quicker than the Southwest terminals at each airport. I still love Southwest but on this route I have now found a better airline."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Boston (BOS) to Atlanta (ATL) to San Francisco (SFO). I was originally supposed to fly from ATL into SJC (San Jose) but was later rebooked Dec 6th and Dec 7th. I missed my connection because the plane was first over- fuelled then under-fuelled and then there were issues with the ""paperwork."" In Atlanta I was forced to call Delta call center (huge lines to speak with customers representatives on site) to rebook my flight was asked to hold for 30 minutes. When I called again they told me I was holding for no reason because the representative had hung up on my call. My bag is also missing."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Outward Manchester UK to Miami via Atlanta 5/12/13 and return from Fort Lauderdale 12/12/13. Flight booked in May for a 13/12 return. One month after booking the return ATL-MAN was cancelled by Delta. Automatically rebooked on a flight for the following day. Delta refused point blank to compensate for the inconvenience and extra nights accommodation. As such we chose to fly back a day earlier then our original plans. My request for compensation was a free upgrade from economy to economy plus on the return Atlantic flight. Simply had the terms and conditions quoted to me. Online check in is a joke. Had seats allocated together on each flight but on clicking the change seat option you will find all other seats marked as unavailable. Options were available to upgrade however at a cost. Our expectations for the flight were therefore low on boarding. However both pleasantly surprised with the flight and service. Transatlantic flight on a B767-300 which featured personal seat back TVs. Good choice although the music channels were a little mainstream for my preference. Food more than OK. Plenty of soft drinks offered and alcohol with the main meal. The return flight was on an older model and featured overhead TVs which didn't matter too much as it was an overnight flight and a good hour shorter in travel time than outward. Both internal flights on a B757-200 were adequate. Seat pitch for all four flights was fine typical of an economy flight. Professional cabin crew on all sectors flown. Touch of humour with the Christmas 2013 flight safety video - certainly kept you watching it. All four flights were full in all cabins all had on time departures and arrivals. Apart from the attitude towards a cancelled flight no issues at all with Delta and would certainly fly with them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","ATL-JFK Thanksgiving week. Despite Diamond status I was with 2 family members so no upgrade O/B but still managed Economy comfort. Pretty good for 2 hour flight although no IFE. As it was thanksgiving I expected the worst but flight took off on time and landed early. On the return all 3 managed to get upgraded to first. Again pretty good for Thanksgiving Sunday. Landed on time bags already on belt by the time we hauled ourselves from E terminal to bag claim. Overall not bad apart from the price ($500 r/t each) but again it was thanksgiving!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","MSP-JFK-MXP and return 4 days later. Economy comfort. First time doing this route as I prefer going into and out of Linate - Milan but short notice trip forced itinerary. Very surprised and pleased with the 767 leg (JFK- Milan) wider seats and quieter cabin than the A330's used on MSP-AMS. CRJ 9XX on the way out a bit small for a 2.5 hr flight A319 on return bigger but noisy. JFK transfer a bit of a hassle with on-going construction but new terminal is nice improvement. MXP was a pain to exit on return. Overall Delta experience is improving and remains a decent choice from MSP to Europe. I still prefer Linate over Malpensa at least for now."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","ONT-SLC-CDG-AMS-MME on 2-3 December (some of the flights were on AF and KL metal but it was a Delta ticket with DL flight numbers for all the segments). An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I started flying Delta about a year ago and surprisingly there wasn't much to complain about. After reading a few reviews I was a bit sceptical but I flew them from SIN-NRT-JFK and I enjoyed the flight more than SQ. The flight attendants were warmer and friendly while we departed on time and on schedule without delays. The legroom was better than SQ and was worth the extra cost. The food although small in portions was not as bad as I expected. Overall I would recommend flying Delta."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","ATL-LGA-ATL first class. Very motivated crew on both flights who seemed genuinely concerned about the well-being of the passengers. Catering was adequate for a 2-hour flight although the meal uploaded in Atlanta was of better quality than the one served on the return. Return flight was delayed by 1.5 hours due to mechanical issues but the crew handled it well and tried to assist passengers with connections. Seats somewhat cramped and no IFE on the A320 and A319 I flew on but I was favorably impressed with the crew."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","DL 80/81 ATL-BRU-ATL. Spent a lot of money to fly in Business Elite. Seats comfortable (lay flat) and entertainment system has an amazing selection of options. Food however was so salty and so processed that it was pretty much inedible. Crews on both flights were quite senior and offered good levels of service being most accommodating. However they all lacked a sense of warmth and welcoming. I am a big fan of Delta Air Lines but these flights were somewhat disappointing primarily due to the poor quality of food and beverage provided in both directions."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Everything was fine however My fiancé and I booked together and were seated separately and they wouldn't do anything to try to get us to be close this is something that many people had complaints and passengers would switch seats to be with their loved ones. They also made us check a bag. Very unhappy about having to check that bag (which was smaller than the other bags that made it on and persons that got on after us also didn't have to check their bags). I don't recommend traveling with them. I just wish that they would have sat us next to each other it makes no sense that they didn't."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","It's been about a month now since my trip from Milan Italy to Las Vegas NV. I flew from Milan to JFK (New York). We waited 4 hours for our connecting flight from New York to Las Vegas. I was assigned a boarding pass and a seat number (24C & 24D) at Terminal 4 gate B25. When I arrived to board the plane at the gate the rudest workers at Delta claimed they didn't see me on the system. When I ask how could this be the Delta representative kept saying ""I don't know"" very condescendingly. An hour before they announced that they needed 2 volunteers to stay overnight for a next flight because they overbooked. Delta forced us to stay at JFK while letting 2 other people take our seats on the flight that we booked over a month prior. We flew all the way from Milan to JFK how were they unable to see us on the system? How were we able to get the boarding passes in the first place if we weren't in the system? The people at the service desk kept giving us attitude and saying to us that they don't see our names on the system. I was so disappointed with my flight experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I booked our Delta flight in May 2013 for 5 family members going to Jamaica Saturday Nov. 23 and returning Saturday Nov.30. We had three changes to our itinerary the last one was in Oct. The flight from Atlanta to Montego Bay was awful. We set in the very back 2 rows of the plane not together but in 2 different rows. We had no windows. On the way back it was the same way. We had our 6 year old granddaughter with us that could see nothing on her first time flying. I'm a Gold SkyMiles Member."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","SFO-ATL-LIM return in regular economy. I got a great deal from SFO to LIM. My overall experience was good. Service on the domestic legs was better than expected with friendly crews and regular drink runs. The crew also responded to the flight attendant button rather promptly. The weak point was the flight from ATL to LIM which was an older plane without personal IFE. However the LIM-ATL flight was on a more modern plane with IFE and plenty of movie choices all free of charge. Food was ok not great but edible and of sufficient quantity. No free alcohol even on international flights to/from LIM. Transfer in ATL was easy with airline representatives at the gate to assist passengers in the transfer process. Would recommend especially if one can get a good deal."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I traveled from Charlotte NC to Milwaukee WI and my connection in Detroit was a bit late and there was not time to transfer my suitcases. They did not arrive in baggage claim. But they delivered them 2 hours away in Madison WI on the same day and it was Thanksgiving Day."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew to New York from Dublin with 2 small kids Fri 22 Nov and returned Mon 25. I must say I was very impressed. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The plane was full and they were kept busy but they really made my daughters feel special giving them extra cookies drinks passing chat etc. Even when one woman decided to go to the restroom a few seconds before takeoff - a potentially serious situation - they were firm but polite as they leaped down the aisle to make her sit down. IFE worked on all seats and while a couple of inches of extra legroom wouldn't have gone amiss it was fine for a six hour flight. A word about the meals. I've noticed many times that the catering supplied by European companies (ie going out) is far superior to what you get coming back from the USA regardless of airline. But that's the only criticism really. Well done Delta. In my experience you're at least as good as BA KLM and Virgin."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","We flew from Manchester UK to Tampa and as Delta gold members we were upgraded to business and first class due to coach being full. It was a great flight great crew and food 3 days later flew from Tampa to Texas Hobby via ATL in coach. The flights were again great snacks and drinks really good service. I feel if you are nice with their staff they are nice back."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I booked a first class ticket using miles about a month ago. The only reason I booked the particular flight (red eye) was because of the 1st class seat options. At that time there were a considerable number of 1st class seats open. I checked in via mobile 24 hours before-no issues. Got through security-still no issues. When I went to board the plane I was told when they scanned my boarding pass that I'd been downgraded to Economy (not even Economy Comfort) because I was on a complimentary upgrade. I explained that absolutely was not the case and that I'd specifically booked the flight as a 1st class ticket. The response I received at that point was that ""Corporate did it because of an equipment change we don't know the criteria they used and we can't change it."" I took it up to the most senior person I could at the gate and got the same generic answer. I used to be a huge proponent of Delta and have defended them countless times to friends. I will never fly with them again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Good on time performance. Wished to have a second warm meal on board an intercontinental flight then just a breakfast. Very noisy cabin due insulation on the 737. Crew seemed unorganized and hasty. IFE wasn't working properly."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Early November BE flight JFK-CDG. Clean aircraft competent FA adequate catering but the Delta lounge at T4 is a disgrace. The complimentary wines are not listed anywhere while the charged offerings are both printed and on electronic pads. Salty snacks only or purchase food. Have they visited their partner Virgin Atlantic's BC lounge? On time arrival and good baggage delivery. Very limited movies on this flight."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On time departure despite chaotic boarding in BE due to a seat configuration change. FA were quite senior and not well groomed especially the purser whose uniform was stained. The FA's were very active with service however. Catering good especially the pre arrival hamburger. Lots of videos although every time there was an announcement (and they seem to make many) my movie reverted to the French language. (CDG-EWR). Pre departure lounge was Air France which was offering a buffet lunch along with many wines champagne and snacks."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My wife and I flew back to London Heathrow on flight 19 from Detroit. This airline is a disgrace. Very poor food but it was the service from the flight attendants which was particularly bad. They seem to have absolutely no idea of offering a service. Passengers were treated with complete indifference and staff spent most of their time in the galley eating and talking loudly. Never again. Next time I go to Detroit I will fly BA or virgin to NY so that I only need to suffer the short hop from NYC to Detroit. Coincidentally I have a friend who has just taken a flight on Delta from NY to London who also experienced shocking service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have been flying and traveling internationally for over 10 years and after flying Delta for the first time I will not be traveling for a very long time. Aside from the cramped plane I was refused food service on my 13 hour flight by the extremely rude flight attendants until I gave in and purchased food items. The flight itself was the absolute worst 6.5 hours of turbulence triggered my anxiety and when I tried to get my medicine from overhead I was shouted at by the attendants. Deltas entertainment was terrible and needs to be updated there were 2 small TVs in front of easily over 50 people. When the flight was over there was a half hour delay and I had to catch my next connecting flight. I will never fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My 7 month pregnant wife and I flew from Chicago to Mexico on Nov 7 2013 on Delta flight 8048. According to the Delta representative I spoke with on the phone Delta messed up and rescheduled everyone on this flight to Nov 8 (without telling anyone and even though the Nov 7 flight still flew). When we didn't show up for our Nov 8 flight in Chicago (since we were already in Mexico since Nov 7 and never knew about the Nov 8 flight) our return flight on Nov 10 was cancelled. We arrived to our airport in Mexico on Nov 10 to find out we had no return ticket to Chicago. The Delta representative was so sorry that she gave us a single 25 dollar gift card to split amongst the 2 of us. This is ridiculous. Why should I ever fly Delta ever again?"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from Chicago to Atlanta. The plane was full the staff very nice and friendly. My only complaint: the cabin was filthy it needed attention and the seats were small I'm a big guy 6 ft and 220 lbs. The flight was a short one if it had been longer it would have been uncomfortable."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Worst airline to fly on if you are in the military traveling on orders. First who in the military travels with one bag that's right we don't we normaly have a few bags and one normaly weighs between 50 to 100 lbs. So why is it that all the other carriers let the military check one bag up to 100lbs no we are not getting over this is the bag that we transport our gear in. The gear that we use to take the fight to the enemy. Come on Delta get with the program and stop trying to make an extra buck off the military. I guess that's why the military generally uses American Airlines first and Delta only as a last resort. The flight only had a few people on board and when some of them asked if they could move to a vacant seat they were told no."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Manchester - Atlanta - San Diego. Plenty of snacks and drinks served. Lunch was good and enjoyable. Good selection of films television and music staff were pleasant and efficient. Temperature of cabin was just right. A very positive experience."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","SEA-AMS-SEA. This last transatlantic with Delta will be my very last. I cannot believe KLM/Air France have partnered with Delta and I'm afraid I'm unlikely to continue patronising that group unless I'm sure I'm not flying on a Delta staffed plane. The service was just appalling. The seats in economy were very poor. The underseat space was cramped by some electrical equipment and also very hot as a result. The in-flight entertainment system was not functioning in my seat or any other seat in our row. The only element of the flight that was any good was the lounge in Seattle which had some space to work and attentive staff."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","BusinessElite SIN-NRT-HNL. Choose Delta only because it offered completely flat beds. B777-200LR flying from SIN-NRT- SIN offers ample legroom when in full recline. However the 767-300 planes NRT-HNL-NRT falls short for anyone over 6’. In full bed mode the ‘seat’ tucks into the narrow space of the seat in front of you. My main gripe was the cleanliness of the cabin. Dirtiest Business Class I've ever flown! Cabin Staff were ok not overly friendly. Pales to any Asian flight crew."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My Husband and I booked First Class. Our plane was finally determined as ""Delayed for Catering"" for 4 hours. We missed our connection of course. Originally we were told it was due to weather. There were no other flights to get us home according to the agent in Salt Lake City who said ""I don't have time to help you go over there to the phone bank"". With no flight no luggage and no help we paid for a hotel room had to by clothes meals and I hoped our underwear would dry I washed it in the sink for the next days flight. We had purposely reserved seats together I have a great deal of flight anxiety. Our rescheduled flights separated us and I cried most of the way home. It's not that we are any better than others but we paid a lot of money for our trip on Delta First Class. We bought the special tickets expecting special service. I'm disturbed with the airlines performance and regard for passengers. I guess we paid for only a larger seat."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","When my wife and I travel we usually travel with Delta or Alaska. We always travel first class and so cannot comment on how things are in coach however we have never been disappointed with Delta traveling first class. They always treat us well from check-in to in-flight. The planes are always clean and the staff is incredibly attentive. Unlike Alaska they never skimp on the amenities. They serve full size meals and are constantly checking to see if there is anything else they can do to accommodate you."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have to say that whilst everyone likes to moan about airlines my recent flight with Delta was great on their services from/to LHR-JFK. The food was also excellent on the outward flight being a vegetarian I requested a special meal and was served minted peas with wild rice and marinated tofu along with a bread roll cheese and crackers and a dessert. Then just before landing we were served Calzone. They certainly don't let you go hungry! On the return journey however the main dish was pasted and vegetables which wasn't to my liking at all but it was a late night flight and I wasn't particularly hungry anyway breakfast then consisted of a cereal bar and a banana. The only gripes I have are that the leg room is cramped - but where isn't it these days! With regard to the on board entertainment whilst having an excellent selection of content was somewhat slow and sluggish and even required re-starting on the return flight. On the ground baggage arrived promptly and check in was also efficient at both airports with staff being courteous and professional. Both flights left before the scheduled departure time and arrived well before their scheduled arrival time in both cases even though on the outward flight there was a delay in passengers boarding. For the price it was truly excellent."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Just flew from BWI to Melbourne FL. Worst flights I have ever had. Both flights were overbooked. The staff were asking for volunteers to take a later flight. The staff were confused and had no idea on what they were doing. They were rude and didn't know their jobs very well. This was both trips with connecting flights in Atlanta both ways. Never will I fly Delta again. One of the staff was standing at the desk telling customers she was nobody and couldn't help anyone. Now that is customer service from Delta Airlines."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My husband and I took a vacation back to the Midwest. We flew Delta from LAX to Minneapolis to Milwaukee with the reverse for the return flights. I was really dreading this - I have MS and knew I would be using a wheelchair. Everything was great! Flights were on time and the pilot and crew were so kind friendly and helpful. My husband and I are tall and we were pleasantly surprised to have ample leg room. Also Delta did a great job with the video on pre-flight safety notes. No one seems to listen to the actual stewards and stewardesses when it comes to this but the video had everyone's attention in this digital age. I definitely recommend flying Delta."

Excellent service and attention from Hawaiian based crew best of any American airline I have traveled on. Both flights on time check in very quick and luggage appeared rapidly. Would recommend."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I flew from Toronto to Atlanta Atlanta to Cancun and Cancun to Atlanta. The seats were very comfy with a good recline especially between Atlanta and Cancun. Crew was very polite but the food choice was very poor. My flight between Toronto and Atlanta was the worst. It was operated by express jet on the behalf of Delta Airlines: poor food was served and the crew wasn't helpful at all. The seats were very hard. Definitely a bad flight. I recommend to fly with Delta airlines despite all but avoid to fly with it subsidiary express jet."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","SFO-LAX LAX-KOA KOA-LAX LAX-SEA SEA-CDG. Very nice experience (again) with Delta. I love Delta upgrade policies on internal flights everything is clear and fair you know at any time why you have been upgraded or not. All flights on time cabin crew smiling all the time and very professional. Very nice food. Twice upgraded with my ElitePlus status. Delta Economy comfort seats really worth."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On our outbound flight the crew ensured some people with ""carry on"" luggage checked their luggage prior to boarding. It appears that many of these ""carry on"" suitcases would not fit into the guide at the check in counter. Often these suitcases barely fit into the overhead. We only take on to the flight my husband's CPAP my purse his small back pack with his meds and my carry-on shoulder bag. All these items fit under the seat in front of us. On our way back people had these ""carry on"" suitcases and one woman had 2! Neither of which fit under the seat. I had a man beside me with a large backpack that he did not stow. He left it standing under his legs. As a result his foot was under the seat in front of me! Where are my feet supposed to go? He should have been told to either stow this backpack in the overhead bins if it did not fit under the seat. Then to add injury to insult I was going to put my umbrella into the overhead and was told that it may impede stowing suitcases! When the service came around I asked for a Bloody Mary mix no ice. The flight attendant complained that this would take more than half a can I don't want ice as it waters down the drink and it's cooled enough. I check all airlines to find the best price I can find. For this trip it was Delta (Alaska). But just because I may find a good price does not mean that I should be treated this way."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Oct 17th Manchester NH to La Guardia NY flight 6269. Then missed flight 1875 La Guardia NY to Tampa Fl. Just recently flew Delta delayed in taking off then was in a holding pattern due to air traffic and missed connecting flight due to this. Wasn't able to get another flight for 8 hours or so. Will not fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","In my opinion Delta airline is the worst I have experienced. I am silver and this is the end of my Delta loyalty. I attempted to hop on an earlier flight several times because I had completed my work in Greensboro early. The lady eagerly said "" are you Gold or Platinum""? I said ""no I am Silver."" She stated it would be 50 dollars to go on standby but she is not going to bother because I am silver. With that I was dismissed with a ""Next"". This is not the first time this has occurred and I travel for business. For validity sake my flight number originally prior to attempting an earlier flight was DL1384 from GSO to ATL."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Took 4 Delta flights 11/10/13 London - Minneapolis - Las Vegas 15/10/13 Las Vegas - Atlanta - London. First time experiencing flying with Delta and it was very disappointing. Like previous comments booked ticket through KLM/Air France where we have always receive a brilliant service. Wondering why they have partnered with Delta to lower their standards. Flight from London to Minneapolis ever so rude cabin crew. Nobody at the entrance to welcome the passengers and direct them to their seats. Not a single smile and very abrupt cabin crew members. The only good thing was they had a good selection of entertainment at least it kept our mind away from their rudeness. Food selection was average. Flight from Minneapolis - Las Vegas more friendly crew and drinks were offered regularly and adequately which made us really surprise for a domestic flight compared to the opposite for the international flight. On our way back at the airport in Las Vegas when checking in again not a single smile from the ground crew or any welcome. Flight from Las Vegas - Atlanta was fine and crew friendly and adequate snacks and drinks served. International flight from Atlanta - London we were welcome this time at the entrance and were directed to our seat. An unpleasant surprise was waiting for me as soon as I popped down the seat tray in front of me to read. Yes it was messy with food stain and dry sauce on it from the previous flight and has not been clean which put me off eating. I requested it to be cleaned which was done pretty much straight away but no apologies whatsoever from the cabin crew. What was more intriguing was the contrast of service between the domestic and the international flights. Will not recommend it to any friends or family."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flight DL241 from Rome to Atlanta. Great flight and service from stewards. We even couldn't fill the 11 hour flight. Great attitude and always busy."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Poor customer service. Sold my seat to someone who was on standby in a complete and utter shambles mix up. Had to ask people to leave the plane for compensation. Poor attitude of staff not helpful at all no empathy for customers situations. Poor service on flights entertainment not working and having to reboot seems to be a daily problem. Planes were dirty and tired. Food was average breakfast dire scrambled egg in a soggy roll after an 8 hour flight. Why not keep it simple with a croissant or pastry or muffin? Wouldn't fly again if I had the choice."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My disabled husband few up to PA from Dallas. His flight up was delayed in Atlanta because the plane he was supposed to fly out on lost its navigation system and they had to find another. That was bad enough but on his way home he left Harrisburg and flew into Detroit when he got off the plane he asked for a wheelchair and help getting to the gate where his connecting flight was departing and was told ""Just go that way and turn left and you will get to the gate."" He got no help so missed his flight to DFW because he was not able to hurry. He was re- ticketed and had to fly into Atlanta before he could return to Texas. On the flight from Atlanta to DFW he was assigned a seat in the back. I was told it was my fault that my husband couldn't get a wheelchair because I didn't book his flight as a disabled passenger! Like I said before this is not the first time we have had issues with Delta but it will be the last!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","JFK to LHR leaving 9.10pm 12th Oct. Delta 0005. Have just returned from NY to London and can only agree with the negative reviews. The most rude cabin staff I have ever experienced. We actually got our tickets through Air France and I noticed that another partner was Virgin an airline I use frequently to go to Tokyo with and rate highly. What on Earth are these decent airlines partnering with this outfit for? Food was also terrible and complimentary drink service a joke. The public address system didn't work I see others have commented the same why can't they fix simple things like that? They must know it doesn't work the staff get angry when you ask them to repeat things. A bad end to an otherwise superb visit to the Big Apple."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Flew Delta Connection (ExpressJet) from Gainesville Florida to Atlanta. Flight was on time and actually arrived ahead of schedule. ExpressJet (DBA Delta Connection) much better than when ASA flew this route as Delta Connection."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Took 4 Delta flights over the summer Amsterdam-Boston Boston-Atlanta Atlanta-Chicago and Boston-Amsterdam on each of the flights the cabin crew were very friendly and attentive (especially the Atlanta-Chicago flight) were relaxed and seemed to enjoy their job. Seats on all flights were very comfortable and the inflight entertainment on the two international segments was very comprehensive. Plenty of legroom too. Full meal service and hot towels were provided on the international segments which was much appreciated. Domestically Free drinks and snacks were offered which is really all that was required for these flights. I will recommend Delta to my friends and family and look forward to flying with them again along with their partner KLM they offer an excellent route network."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I booked a flight from Denver Colorado to Rochester NY with a connecting flight in LaGuardia. I booked the flight for my grandfathers funeral that was the next morning. The flight was delayed so I was unable to make my connecting flight. Instead they put me on a flight to Salt Lake City Utah to go to Atlanta Georgia to go to Rochester NY. It took over 20 hours to get from Denver to Rochester there was no compassion for my situation by the Delta airline staff. Horrible customer service. I will never fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","with a group of 86 flying DL16 and 17 SYD-LAX return Sept/Oct 2013. this is the second large group experience on this route with Delta the last being four years ago. As in the last I have nothing but praise for Delta. Check- ins with lots of excess/oversized luggage were most efficient and very quick indeed. The ground staff at both terminals were polite well trained and accommodating. The self check-in computers in LAX were very intuitive and easy to use. Both flights were on time. Inflight service was excellent. Flying the return route in the back of economy I noted how little wait there was for meals after the service had started. Again the service was not only quick but accommodating and compared very well to Singapore; my personal benchmark. The food was fine for economy class airline fare. The entertainment options were comprehensive. Perhaps the airline could upgrade its earphones a little. Seating was comfortable. The Comfort Economy which I used on the outward bound trip was well and truly worth the money. Most importantly Delta has its own terminal at LAX; meaning you avoid the general admissions hall. This is an excellent reason in itself to choose the airline on the SYD-LAX route."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I regularly travel between South Africa and the USA always on South African Airways (SAA). I have just travelled on Delta from South Africa to Atlanta. Both the ground staff and cabin staff were appalling. Gives rudeness a whole new meaning. Do Delta train staff to be so rude or is this a criterion for selection to Delta staff. We were offered no headphones. After 45 mins of attempting to get the cabin crew attention we were finally given a broken set of earphones. We again had great difficulty in getting their attention in getting another set. There was no choice of wines. Just a glass of box wine. We asked for a large bottle of water as my colleague and I drink a great deal en route. We were told that this is not allowed! We were assured that cabin crew would pace the plane with offers of drinks all night. Not only was this absolutely not the case but again it was virtually possible to get their attention at any stage of the night. The supper was moderate. The ""breakfast"" was probably the worst meal I have had on a flight ever. It was accompanied by a literally frozen salad so one had to chomp the ice off. SAA offers seats in the emergency exit at no charge. Delta uses this as another opportunity to rip off customers. Delta staff do yourselves a favour and travel on SAA to find out how to offer a high lass service."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","29th Sep from Shanghai to Tokyo on DL296 and from Tokyo to Shanghai by DL295 on 5th Oct. I took the flight to and fro from Shanghai to Tokyo. it was a nice experience. The safety presentation that they provide is really unique. Food Quality was also excellent. Staff was very polite inside the airline but Staff at Tokyo Airport Check-In counters were rude and unfriendly and I hope Delta can do something about it as it spoils the image of the airline. The flights were on time and my kids really enjoyed the in-flight entertainment."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","My wife and I recently traveled for business out of 4 flights 2 of the departing flights were late the second causing us to miss our connecting flight that left early. The flight was scheduled for 12.05 and we were standing at the gate at 12.03 the plane was already gone after we rushed off the plane and across Atlanta airport because this being a Delta hub they can't have planes in the same concourse. We go to the counter and are told they moved us to a different flight without telling us because we weren't going to make our original flight. So they are delaying us 2 hours because they couldn't leave on time for a 8.25 first flight. I politely asked if we could wait in the Delta sky club and was rudely told that it costs 50.00 to use the sky club. I will make sure I will not fly Delta again."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","October 6 from LAX to ATL-Flight started out fine nothing really to complain about. The stewards were average somewhat snooty. Had a good selection of entertainment. Regular snacks on the plain (peanuts pretzels cookies). The end of the flight was extremely rough due to rain but the captain gave some reassurance. Then we landed with only minutes until our next connecting flight to MGM. This is where our trip took a nasty turn. We arrived at the gate with 20 minutes to spare (our flight was to take off at 8.55) but our flight was delayed 5 minutes so we had some breathing room. Then our flight got delayed another 20 minutes then another hour then at 11.45 (sitting in the terminal for over two hours) they cancelled it. We got a rental car that we could have had two hours ago and been home by now."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","6 sectors with Delta in last 3 month. Winnipeg-Minneapolis-Amsterdam on July 10th Amsterdam-Minneapolis-Winnipeg on August 19th then Winnipeg-MSP-LaGuardia on August 27th. All flights except one on time great service provided by cabin crew. On long haul flights hot towels were offered which is very nice touch. Great food and beverages. Bags delivered promptly on arrival. Delta prices and customer service is definitely competitive. Will fly with them again!"
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Man to SFO via Atlanta. New York to Manchester via Atlanta. Both Manchester flights on A330 very comfortable seating is 2x4x2 with each seat having its own inflight entertainment. Other sectors on A319/b737. Service on all the flights was excellent very friendly staff. A lot better than American. Reserved seats together on all flights when booking saved a lot of problems at check in. Transfer in Atlanta was quick and efficient well within 90 minutes suggested. Flights were a good deal."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","AUS to JFK JFK to NCE flight DL 1972 and DL 0082. Return NCE to AMS to ATL to AUS. DL 9497 and DL0239 with ATL to AUS DL 0686. I prefer Delta when flying American carriers and they're my no. 2 choice for all airlines Air France being my no. 1. In a trip this month to France flying into Nice I would have few complaints. An issue I've not encountered before rather two issues are the problem of the midplane lavatories next to the exit row seats and Deltas food service. I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue. I have never had worse airline food than these two trips. When a convenience store Hot Pocket rates over Delta's offerings there is a real problem."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LHR-JFK-LAX-LHR (via Detroit). I purchased the tickets for almost £300 cheaper then the British Airways / Virgin Atlantic equivalent - and it was money well saved! To JFK had great pitch in 767 economy great food drink and snacks and the on demand touch screen entertainment meant the flight went really quick. All the internal flights were on 757s and they were as equally as good and all had touch screen on demand entertainment which I wasn't expecting. It's right to say that American airlines have a bad reputation but my perception has changed and when I come back to the USA next year I will fly delta. The product is on par if not better then the other airlines and would recommend them."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I have been a gold member for at least one year. I usually fly every 4 to 6 weeks from DCA to Lagos Nigeria. The food service is extremely poor. Breakfast is disappointing I have now learnt to eat before flying. The airline assumes everyone can eat the cheesy bread served in the AM the rice has practically no taste and the bathrooms are in such a bad state before we land. I have only been upgraded twice on the economy flights. I ask each time and the response is the same 'you may or may not be upgraded and you will be told at the gate'. I flew Air France on the trip before last and even got upgraded on that flight to economy comfort. Delta really does need to appreciate their gold members. I fly delta because of convenience but I'm beginning to think it may not be worth it. Bad food with no absolutely no fringe benefits is quite frustrating especially when other airlines offer much more. To fly long distance every 4 to 6 weeks with no benefits are not worth it."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Whatever happened to schedule integrity? We booked our vacation to St. Martin on Delta because no overnight flights were required. Then they changed their schedule and now we have to overnight in Detroit on the way home. They will do nothing about this inconvenience and expense."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","LAX-JFK DL1762 Sep 19 JFK-SEA DL 161 Sep 22. Business elite 767. Excellent experience especially for domestic service. Truly international service with lie flat seats duvets and quite good food. Service was efficient and warm. Would definitely choose this again over most other carriers on these routes."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","Seattle (SeaTac) - Paris (CDG): 23 September. Flight was horrible! Low Seat comfort and low quality food. But the worst thing is seat assignment: my girlfriend was behind me and that's how it was for a lot of couples and friends! It's obvious that this is done on purpose in order to earn money from change seat utility during the check-in online."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","On both outbound (Atlanta) and inbound (Manchester) the controller in my seat did not work (same fault L/R control not working) fortunately my wife was not using hers so changed seats. Really annoying on longer flights. Service good legroom as ever poor. Atlanta airport terminal improved beyond all measure actually pleasurable experience after zoo on previous occasions."
"Delta Air Lines customer review","I had flown to SFO from LHR trip with Air France which was fantastic. My return flight with Delta was anything but. SFO-ATL then to LHR. Flight to ATL was really bad. The seats were uncomfortable and old. The cabin crew were average at the best of times. There was no food unless you wanted to pay $10 for a box of candy and potato chips. The inflight entertainment was terrible - there were about 3 free things to watch - everything else had to paid for. After already paying a lot of money for a flight airlines then try and nickel and dime you for things like entertainment and food. Next was ATL-LHR. This was no better. Seats were uncomfortable and cramped. I'm only 5'2 and even I was uncomfortable. Entertainment was not great although a step up from the last. The fact that there was no personal controller really irritated me. When the screen is unresponsive the last thing I want to do on a long flight is have my arm up constantly hitting the screen just to get something to work. The cabin crew again were just average. The food was pretty bad and bland. The PA announcements were hard to hear and were of terrible quality. Overall it was a terrible experience. The only good thing about the flight was their safety/welcome video! This was actually well thought out and funny - I actually took notice of it and watched the whole thing on both flights. Too bad they don't put that much thought and effort in to the actual flying part."
