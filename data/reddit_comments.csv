I think one of the ""harder"" questions is something like (y-12)*4=16), a how yould you react section (if 2 customers got in a fight, would you a,b,c,d...), a personality section (how well do you work with others, etc...). One of the tests is apperently mock simulator where you have to use the arrow keys on the keyboard to fly a plane to some rings while paying attention and keeping track of what people are telling you, how many times you hear a buzzer, how many planes you see, where you see the airport is, etc. Like I said this is just stuff I saw online but I'm sure if you just do some basic review of the fundamentals you should be fine.

Based on the laws and statutes of the European Union, one can work and live in the European Union if they are nationals of countries that have an agreement with the EU to work there with a work permit. No restrictions. There are more than 79 such countries.

 [https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/work-permits/index\_en.htm](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/work-permits/index_en.htm) 

If a person has dual citizenship of the United States and of one of those countries, they can work and live in the EU. If a person is a permanent resident of the U.S. and is a national of one of those 79 countries, they also can work and live in the European Union. They would have to file for a re-entry permit before leaving the U.S., which allows them to stay outside the U.S. for up to 2 years continuously without losing permanent residency. Or they can just fly back to the U.S stay a couple of days then fly back to Europe. 

So 'technically' Americans are eligible for the program.",1564866173.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/ci891a/jetblue_gateway_select_program_questionsdiscussion/,1,1,0,t3_bfh933

jetblue,"Our original flight out of JFK last Saturday evening was canceled 24 hours in advance. I know there was supposed to be a big storm, but I don’t understand why JetBlue cancels flights so easily. For some context, there were about 150 flight cancelations last Saturday, 138 of those flights were JetBlue. Delta didn’t cancel a single flight and AA canceled one. They offered us seats on a flight from LGA to Boston. We had a four hour layover in Boston before our flight from Boston to SLC. We boarded the flight from Boston to SLC without incident, the sat on the tarmac for nearly two hours.  I think we finally took off with about two minutes left in our de-icing window. (My understanding is you have to be de-iced again if you stay at the airport for longer than 60 minutes after being de-iced). We finally got to SLC around 1:00 AM.   12 hours for a flight that should have taken 4.5 hours.  

On the return flight SLC to JFK, we were an hour late getting out.

This isn’t the first time I’ve been burned by JetBlue. They once stranded me in NYC and refused any kind of compensation because they claimed the flight was canceled due to weather. When I pointed out that every other JetBlue flight was leaving on time, I was told our particular aircraft was smaller and couldn’t fly in bad weather. When I pointed out that the planes that were leaving were the exact same make and model as our plane, I was basically told to shut up and sit down. We finally got another JetBlue employee to admit our flight had only 20 or so booked passengers and they used the weather as an excuse to cancel a flight that would have resulted in them losing money.

If you do decide to transport the dog, consider helping it reposition mid flight.

Also, are you sure you have the max size carrier? The duffel sized carrier we had was capable of housing a dog larger than 15 pounds.

This delta bag in medium is rated for dogs up to 16 pounds. And while above the size limit, it should not be an issue if you dont make it one.

Call Jetblue on Thursday night and see what they say. They may or may not have any useful info ~24hrs before hand. Expect to get to the airport at your scheduled check-in time, and expect to spend a long time in the terminal waiting.

jetblue,"JetBlue point prices track the cash prices at a rate of (very close to) 1.4 cents per point, eg a $500 cash ticket will be priced at about ~35,700 points. If the cash price goes up or down, the points price will go up or down to keep that same ratio.

September is so far away right now, the price they're offering is probably their rock bottom, and it's unlikely to move at all for a few months - but when it does, it's virtually guaranteed to move up, not down. Prices really only drift down after they've already skyrocketed upwards in the few weeks before a flight.

This is _especially_ true if you're flying JFK<->SFO or BOS<->SFO, which are two of the most competitive routes in the country. As a result, airlines compete _very_ closely on price and the inventory is managed so carefully that there tends to be very little price fluctuation at all. JetBlue (and all the others) know that if they ratchet up the price on this route, other airlines will be perfectly happy to sell you the ticket at the current low rate instead. So buy the ticket, cross it off your list, and move on to worrying about other things.

btw, Sept 2 is also the Sunday before labor day, which means prices may be a good bit higher this weekend than others. That's not going to change unless they suddenly reschedule the holiday, though, so waiting to buy this ticket won't save you any money.

jetblue,"Yeah, JetBlue will always be a point to point and it's drastically different than how legacies run their operation. This is not saying there aren't *any* connecting flights. It just minimizes it.

 Really how it works is they setup shop with a 'focus city' and then just spin off a ton of destinations from that city and that's it. Point to point. Instead of routing you through hubs to get you to where you need to go. But to keep the network strong there are connections between the focus cities because one might have a destination you need to get to. There's pros and cons. The biggest con being that JetBlue can't afford to fly everywhere and anywhere like a large carrier. Yet, even on jetblue there's example of  connecting flights. For example if you live in NY and want to get to Dallas on Jetblue the only way to do so is to go from JFK to BOS then from BOS to DFW.

JetBlue does work like any other airline. So if you book a connecting flight (under one PNR number) and you checked bags you can always expect that it will be moved over to  the other jetblue flight. If you booked two flights for the same day and it's not under the same PNR I would expect you'd have to recheck.

Here's some people that mentioned it going far back as 2008:

The average flight (as of 2015) in the US was around $380, so running a similar itinerary to the last time would likely be somewhere north of $4,000, not excluding expenses for the traveler (I'm pretty sure I kicked in around $1,000 of my own money over the month for random food, drink, lodging and transportation expenses). 

If someone wanted to actually put in the effort to generate the interest to kick it off, I'd be a supporter, but the fact that fact that over the years since this happened the last time, it's never gotten any further than people asking if we should try again indicates to me that nobody actually wants to be bothered with coordinating the thing.

*Q: ""Do the points I earn with Rapid Rewards partners help qualify me for a Companion Pass?""* 

*A:  ""Points earned by making purchases with a Southwest Rapid Rewards® Credit Card, and your base points earned from Rapid Rewards® partners count toward Companion Pass. Purchased points, points transferred between Members,* ***points converted from hotel and car loyalty programs****, and e-Rewards, e-Miles, Valued Opinions, and Diners Club, and Partner bonus points (with the exception of the Rapid Rewards Credit Cards from Chase)* ***do not qualify as Companion Pass qualifying points****.""*

SouthwestAirlines,"Are you comparing ***only*** 737s from all carriers? 

Southwest flies only 737s which is (relatively) small, zippy, and manuever easier while taxiing when compared to, say, a 777, 747, or an A340, etc.

Furthermore, when landing, the ground roll will be much shorter for a 737 than a larger wide body aircraft, often meaning shorter taxi back to the gates and more taxiway options for vacating the runway.",1570803132.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/dg1iw4/fast_taxi_times/,2,2,0,t3_bfh933

My best guess is that you randomly got flight attendants before that served it so you could mix it yourself (we all generally serve similarly, but in our own way. Rarely a flight attendant lets every passenger mix their own). As far as I know they’ve never trained to serve the bottle, unless asked, and then we happily do so.

SouthwestAirlines,"Not me... of course.

But SOME flight attendants hold specific ones that have no names because they can go a long way to smooth over passenger mishaps (“oops! Sorry I dribbled a bit of soda on you!”) or can help when we need a little more convincing of the general passenger group to do something nice (“hey guys, anyone willing to trade seats so I can put this mother and child together? I’ll give you a drink!” And sometimes they don’t want it right now, so coupon). There’s many instances that these come in handy.

And some flight attendants give them out to people in their lives. My doctor said she has another patient who is a flight attendant and she brings her coupons. (Not sure if she was implying something haha.) Friends and family. 

Or when we travel for leisure maybe we want a drink without trying to get a comp from a fellow employee.

SouthwestAirlines,"This is absolutely anecdotal evidence here, and definitely third-hand information, so please continue your own research. But I once had a coworker (so another SWA employee) tell me that he ran into Herb Kelleher once and asked him if we always have the farthest gates because they’re the cheapest ones. Herb laughed and said “That does sound like us!” But no, he said it was because they’re the closest ones to the runways so we get a better spot in line. So I think you may be on the right track.

Also, as someone who stands up to perform the safety demo during taxi, I can personally confirm that lots of our pilots drive like frickin NASCAR racers.

SouthwestAirlines,"TL;DR I was giving them $25k+ a year and each time I informed them of problems, I was basically told to deal with it.

They left my bag out on the ramp in the pouring rain for about 45 minutes because the employees apparently aren't allowed to work during a storm. Which is fine, but at least do something to secure the bags - leave them on the plane, roll them under the overhang, throw a tarp over it all. Don't just leave them exposed to the elements. My bag was hard sided, so the only area for moisture to enter is the 0.5"" strip of fabric around the zipper, so that really demonstrates just how long it sat out there for the contents inside to get drenched. At some point, the storm stopped, where I assume they did get my bag covered in some way, but not delivered, because then it started storming again (I don't know why they wouldn't at least bring what they *had* to the carousel rather than waiting for it all), because when it arrived, the contents were drying and mildew-smelling from still being in the wet bag.

All my dress clothes for my work trip were unwearable and stinky without a wash, so I had to pay $75 in the hotel's absurd laundry fees to get the items cleaned. Southwest refused to even apologize or reimburse for that, even though I sent the executive offices a receipt, saying essentially that their employees are more important and that's the risk you take when checking a bag.

I flew them every other week for work (I was, and still am, ALP through 2019) on the DAL-DCA route, and even with what appeared to be preferential treatment at congested DCA (we always happily skipped past the line to takeoff before AA) and DAL being home base, there were constantly 1-2 hour delays, either due to a late inbound aircraft, or some maintenance issue on the ground, to the extent that I even had the executive office produce an Excel sheet of all my flights that basically summed up ""damn, you're right.""

Obviously maintenance is critical for aviation, but when it was happening for so many flights, it shows that the planes just weren't being repaired in their nighttime downtime (I don't know if or how this fits in with the maintenance union being at odds with SWA), but the late inbound aircraft and several of my own late departures could be easily explained by the fact that 30 minutes (or less, since things usually didn't start right on time) is not enough time to board when you have a bunch of morons that can't find their favorite seat and have to walk *backwards* when they can't find it at the back of the plane, or people who don't take advantage of the free checked baggage and need to find room for their enormous carry-on (though, based on my experience, dunno if I can blame them). A good friend of mine is a Southwest FO and he agrees - if boarding gets bungled, it not only bones that flight, but it creates a domino effect for the rest of that flight number's day.

I collected over $2,000 in LUV vouchers because of my complaints of significantly late flights. They didn't do me much good because they'd just get redeemed on more late flights. I drew a line in the sand when my wife was very pregnant and I knew I'd get a call one day to get my ass on the next flight home. I just couldn't trust SWA to get me home in time if I needed to be.

I switched to United, and not only does my status mean my bag is specially tagged to be one of the first off of the plane, but the boarding process is 45 minutes *with assigned seats*, and only just yesterday did I have my first major delay with them after 25+ flights, and their CS bought me a last-minute ticket on an AA flight to a different DC airport leaving from a few gates down. One time when I had a delay at DAL and asked if I could get on a neighboring Alaska flight to DCA, they laughed at me and said ""if you're paying for it.""

United is absolutely more expensive and their CS is definitely more ""suit and tie""  than the SpongeBob attitude you can get from SWA employees, but to me, it's worth paying double to know that they'll do whatever it takes to get me where I need to be on time.",1570723293.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/dft2qy/im_new_here_im_a_huge_southwest_fan_does_anyone/,-3,-3,0,t3_bfh933

SouthwestAirlines,"For someone who flies Southwest as much as you do, I’m surprised you are not aware of their policy. Yes, it’s open seating which they clearly state on every flight means you can take any available seat. 

As others have mentioned here, though, they have no position on saving seats. They don’t say you can’t and they don’t say you can. They will not stop someone from reserving a seat for a later companion. 

Ages ago, this REALLY pissed me off too because I also made assumptions about their “policy” only to later really look into it. Of course, this happened when I saw someone literally reserve two entire rows, both sides, for their later boarding family. I was incensed. 

Now that I know the rules, though, I’m much more calm about it and frankly use it to my advantage now too. I always board before my companion and always save them one seat. It’s a bit stressful at times because you have to tell passersby that someone is already sitting there but it’s fine. (I will note that we still ALWAYS buy early bird just to reduce the boarding difference). 

Any way, saving whole rows is certainly a dick move, but it is NOT against Southwest’s policies.",1570717453.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/d812b9/open_seat_policy_my_ass/,2,2,0,t3_bfh933

SouthwestAirlines,"There problem isn't so much that people have us trash. The biggest problem is that the 700s just don't have room for all the trash on longer flights. Especially places where pizza is a popular food choice. We have one small trash can up front, and a fairly normal sized can in the back. If we run out of room, we can put it in a large bag in a compartment meant for wheelchairs, but if it has a wheelchair in it..... 

My other complaint is with when people hand me trash. During boarding, if I'm up front, and people walk past trashcans in the terminal, and one or two near or in the jetbridge to hand me a giant bag of trash that takes up half my trash can, it gets annoying. If I have a tray full of drinks, just wait till I'm done. No one wants to see me take trash from someone and then immediately hand them a drink.

SouthwestAirlines,"1, unfortunately, the official policy is that there is no policy. It puts the flight crew in a tough spot as if I tell you that you can't save seats, and you complain, the company won't necessarily back me up, at the same time, if I say you can, and someone else complains, I won't be backed up then either. They tell us to use our best judgement and handle the situation, but if we ask what the official policy is, the supervisors say we don't have a policy. 

In general, what I find MORE annoying is the people who save seats for their imaginary friends. I've had full flights with one seat open and a passenger needing said seat, and the person next to it keeps telling me she's saving it for her husband. Or the couple that puts 5 bags on the middle seat to block it. 

2, often times if there are one or two seats left, I'll tell the family to put their child in a seat until we know for sure that they need that seat. If the flight is overbooked and I know it's full I'll tell them, but if rather the kid be in a seat if possible. It's much safer for the kid to be buckled in a seat than being held onto. I personally disagree with allowing lap children, but until the faa changes it's policy again, people will happily today their child's life and their comfort to save money. Even when the child has a ticket and a seat, the number of people who won't buckle their child for landing because they are sleeping is astounding. (Also the number of adults who get mad when I tell them to buckle up is a bit insane)

3, customers of size are no longer even required to pay for the extra seat, they can purchase it and then get a refund after the flight, or talk to customer service at the airport and ask for an extra seat for free. But there are still people who won't do it for whatever reason, and then I have to explain to someone why they don't get to go home to see their kids for Christmas because someone else didn't ask for a second seat.",1570658411.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/dfn859/passengers_really_rant/,18,18,0,t3_bfh933

If they do not themselves add this option upon booking, it is technically up to the CS agent to mention this to them upon check in. Proper protocol is to ask the passenger,

""Hello sir/ma'am. Would you be able to comfortably lower both armrests while seated on the plane?""

The only reason she was caught was because another lady had a boarding pass with the same seat. She alerted the crew who then could not get this woman to produce ID or a boarding pass. All I could think of is if this was a WN flight, she would've flown no problem because of the open seating policy!

It's not stated in the linked article, but on ABC News they said she was able to get past the first TSA agent who scans your boarding pass & ID by slipping past while they were busy with someone else. She apparently went through the normal TSA screening machines, but then slipped past the gate agent using the same method!

You get a computer at the gate where you'll make announcements, scan boarding passes, help passengers pre-board/anything they might need help with. 

You also might be in the coordinators room which oversee's the operation such as being the middle man for radio calls, transferring calls to people, assigning planes to gates, making sure inbound connecting passengers make their connecting flight and make sure everything run's smooth as much as possible. Its a big job and might sound hard at first, but once you find your way to get things done, you'll find it easy.

Both of these carriers are generally more preferred for business travel.",1569970558.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/d6owzf/do_you_think_swa_will_ever_restore_its_service_to/,1,1,0,t3_bfh933

SouthwestAirlines,"Airport features wise, you're going to be disappointed. Your dining options are a Sam Adams Brewery Restaurant that I've never seen more than 2 people in, and a Dunkins with the gate halfway closed. That's it. There are a total of 6 baggage claims, only 1 ever used, TSA is literally sleeping on the job, there's no special line for Pre-Check because you're the only person being screened that hour, and it takes about 30 seconds to walk from the jetway out to the street/parking garage.

But, operations wise, all of that makes for an absolutely painless check-in experience. You can show up 20 minutes prior to departure and not feel stressed about possibly missing your flight. Way better than the 17 mile walk to Terminal A at BOS.

There's so little traffic on the apron that 90% of the Southwest pilots don't even stop to turn onto the runway. You're going 45 mph on the taxiway, bank a hard U, and they floor it and get the hell out of there. You never stop once between gate and takeoff.

Make sure to get a picture with the giant moose near ticketing though. My wife and I have made a tradition of that every year we fly up for Christmas.

As to EWR closing because of MAX - I doubt that is the main reason.  They expect to have MAX back in service soon and would not pull out of a city just to add it back.  There are lots of reasons they drop some airports.

As for the return to Denver, I believe since it was paired up with the flight to SD that you never took, Southwest does have the right to cancel your entire booking since Southwest shows you with two separate flights to SD within a day of each other.

Do you want the window seat instead and she will sit in the middle seat?”

SouthwestAirlines,"I went through a VERY short layover in MCO (40 min) not too long ago and while I did stress it, I made the connection. Here's a few things I'd say as tips:

* Sit close to the front on the first leg so you can get off as fast as possible. IMO it's okay to hop up the moment the bell dings and jet to the front, saying kindly ""Excuse me, I have a short connection"" and moving forward. You'll never see these people again anyhow. ;-)
* Let the flight crew know you have a tight transfer so they can assist if needed.
* Pack more than normal essential items into your carry-on bag. You'll make your connection but there's a higher chance your checked bag will not. Mine didn't and SW was good with getting it to me the following day. However, make sure an extra set of clothes and more than normal carry-on essentials are on you, in case your checked bag is delayed.
* If it is delayed, get SW to comp you. For me, they offered a voucher if I came to the airport to get it. If you can swing a situation like that, do it. It's free money.
* Familiarize yourself with the C concourse before you leave. Most airports have maps you can view and/or save. This will help you know where you'll need to go.
* Use an app like App in the Air or some other tracker to pull up your connecting gate the moment you land. Then by seeing where you're pulling up to, you can know where to go.
* Finally, boarding will have likely began so hop to the front of the line if your group was called and done. Let them know at the door you're A (if they're boarding B) and they'll let you get right on. Don't expect to get any good seat associated with your boarding group. In these instances, making your connection is more important than getting the seat you ""must"" want.",1568827343.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/d60hrf/very_short_layover_in_atlanta/,13,13,0,t3_bfh933

SouthwestAirlines,"I literally dealt with this same exact issue 2 weeks ago. Both my flights to and from the destination were cancelled and I was booked on MUCH earlier flights which ruined my itinerary that included prepaid activities that couldn't be refunded.

I called Southwest and spoke to two different supervisors that couldn't have cared less that I was going to lose money on my other plans due to their schedule changes. They have known for months the 737 Max's weren't likely to be flying this year yet continued to sell tickets for fights in 2019.  I asked if they would be willing to make any sort of gesture of goodwill and even joked about even a drink voucher or just a smile from the gate agent... the supervisor flatly said no, it's not their responsibility to make things right. Apparently even a smile (granted I was joking when I asked) is a bridge too far. That same supervisor then had the audacity to try and make me feel sorry for THEIR predicament with having 35 planes out of service and how it's difficult to operate. Long story short, once my flights are done and I know I don't have to reschedule anything, I'm cancelling my Southwest credit card and will use Alaska, Jet Blue, or Spirit who have comprable prices from my airport. I've been a loyal Southwest customer for years, but the absolute lack of any effort to be even marginally accommodating was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Long story short, don't expect Southwest to give you a nickel or show any sort of understanding for your situation and try to make things right.",1568385210.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/d38y7s/sw_changed_flight_2x_new_schedule_doesnt_work/,2,2,0,t3_bfh933

SouthwestAirlines,"Sucks. Probably has a lot to do with the Max8 planes being out of service. That’s why the schedule has been being changed, and they keep getting extended to be out of service because Boeing is still working to get their fix approved by the FAA. These things are out of SW’s hands, which I’m sure is no difference to you at all. All that to say, that’s likely the backstory to the changes.

If you already called them I’m sure they’ve offered everything they are able to. 

Could you consider booking one night at a hotel near the airport for the last night and fly out in the morning? Maybe find a Priceline deal, or some other hotel offering a decent alternative?

Southwest has great customer service, but in this case they likely don’t owe you anything. Instead what you can do is search incessantly non stop, everyday, every chance you get.

Southwest points are worth roughly 1.5x - 1.6x if you transfer points directly, so you can save a little bit depending on the flight if you book through Southwest, but it may still be worth it to go through Chase if you think you'll be able to earn the companion pass.

Pro tip: if you can go to the airport ticket counter to book the Frontier flights (in advance), you'll save $19 per ticket versus buying online.

Yeah, you're going to pay for the bags and seat selection on Frontier, but it's like $35 for the first checked bag and $12 to choose a seat, which still keeps you way cheaper.

You mentioned 4 tickets - with Frontier if you bought the tickets at the counter you could do it for $500 or less (depending on how many checked bags total).

Getting the card is probably the better bet so you can get the new cardmember bonus.  If you're going to use the $75 travel credit, then the extra $5 to get the Priority over the Plus ($69 annual fee) is worth it.

Getting the four upgraded boardings is nice as you can decide after you do the normal check in if you'd like to upgrade.

SouthwestAirlines,"So Southwest reserves the first 15 boarding spots for business select. After that, they will sell same-day upgrades to anyone who wants to buy one until they fill whatever remaining 15 spots are left. That being said, historically it's been pretty rare for all those spots to fill. There's usually only a few people with business select on any given flight and even less people that pay for the upgraded boarding same day. (Most people that want a better boarding spot pay for the ""early bird"" check-in which is much cheaper than the same-day upgrade - but doesn't get you quite as far to the front). Honestly, I don't think I've ever been on a flight with A1-15 was full (but maybe it happens on a few specific routes where a ton of business select passengers fly?).

All that being said, southwest just introduced the CC you're talking about a few months ago that comes with the same-day upgrades. This is the first time they've had that as a benefit and it will be interesting to see if it dramatically increases the number of people trying to get a same-day upgrade.

delta,"Good old Ship 6301. The first 747-400 Boeing built, which they then sent to Pratt & Whitney as a test bed, before it fell into NWA's hands, and then, IIRC, it became Delta's first 747-400 since they had retired their own 747s in the '80s. 

If anyone's curious, you can visit her in ATL at the Delta Flight Museum. Front half is exactly as she was in service, back half has the interior removed and plexiglass floors so you can look right at her insides, control cables and all. All entry fees, souvenirs, and donations go straight to running the Delta Flight Museum, which is kept open by the volunteer work of Delta employees and donations. If anyone really wants to see some cool memorabilia for sale, check for the Surplus Sale Day from the museum on the second or third (can't remember exactly) Friday of the month. Really cool stuff to be had for not a lot of money.

EDIT: Forgot to say that's a 757-200 next to her (thank you to u/mtcman379 for the correction!)  and you can find a 767-200 inside the museum, The Spirit of Delta, which was bought 100% by employee donations and given to the company as a thank you. There's also a fully restored DC-3 inside, which is open to the public for an hour every month.

I don't see that anymore.  They get loaded as all the others.

I wonder if this is because bags are now scanned as they are offloaded from the cart and into the aircraft? Holding them outside the aircraft is an opportunity for an unscanned bag to get 'lost'. Who knows.

I believe those priority tags are really a passive-aggressive joke intended to give customers a warm and fuzzy feeling.

If it comes down to 1 seat available and you and your companion as 1 and 2 on the upgrade list, I’ve found the most gate agents will page you and ask if you’d like to split up (one gets upgraded) or pass on the upgrade all together.

If you do the mileage run to get Gold, you'll have Gold for maybe 14 months and have to do a run next year to requalify.  Rollover 18k and your pattern will get you Gold summer 2020 and you're qualified into January 2022 (call it 19 months of Gold).  If you're cutting travel next year, Gold for 2020 is nice (but you get less use of the benefits), so maybe the run is worth it.  If you're increasing travel next year you get closer to 25 months of Gold.

Also, the golden era of online travel discounts is over. 10-15 years ago Travelocity / Priceline / Orbitz / etc would save you a fortune over booking directly with the hotel or airline.

Today I almost always get the same or better rate direct than I do through Tripadvisor / Kayak / whoever. I'll still find the occasional deal but it's nothing like it used to be.

With the new construction imminent, Delta has completely forsaken all presence in T2 and will operate out of T5, where 99% of carriers are international save for Frontier, iirc. Should make interline transfers a lot of fun for those connecting to or from other domestic carriers. 

I don't know how many gates Delta will gain (or lose?) but they should be able to lease for less since UA and AA aren't in play. I'm actually not sure that anyone is really leaving T5? 

The Skyclub question is an interesting one. T5 already has a KE and AF lounge.

delta,"If lounge access is what you’re after, I’d get the Amex Platinum Card, especially if you fly international. It has many of the same benefits (Global Entry Fee, SkyClub access when flying Delta, etc) but you get 5x points instead of 3x and Amex points rollover 1:1 into SkyMiles. I find Amex points into SkyMiles partners give you a better exchange because their rewards charts can sometimes be much better than Delta. You don’t have that flexibility with Delta SkyMiles credit cards. If you have a family, the Platinum card and the Priority Pass lounges have a much more liberal guest allowance and the biggest factor is that authorized users on the Amex Platinum card get some of the Amex Platinum benefits while Reserve card benefits only extend to the primary account holder. This is huge. I had to open a Delta Reserve for me and a separate Reserve for my wife ($450/each, so $900 annually) BUT if I would’ve gotten the Amex Platinum card I could’ve added her as an authorized user (and 2 additionals) for $175 making my annual fee with the Amex platinum $725 ($550 + $175) and she gets lounge access and many of the other great benefits that come with the Amex Platinum. Value for money is definitely here if you travel enough. 

What you haven’t mentioned is how far you’re expecting to fly, what level of medallion status you’re expecting to attain without bonus MQMs, etc. With the recent changes, Delta has made it very clear that the strategy and value proposition for holding the Reserve (and the Delta SkyMiles Platinum to some degree) is reaching a level of status you wouldn’t otherwise enjoy, getting into only Delta SkyClubs with limited guest access (not the over 1,500 lounges that the Amex network grants you), and helping you get more upgrades by making it a trump card for people of the same medallion status.

We will be downgrading my wife’s reserve and I’ll be getting the Amex Platinum and adding her as an authorized user. I’ll probably keep mine as I fly around 20-25 flights and have seen the Reserve card get me to the top of the upgrade list and the MQM bonus will be how I reach Platinum Status so it is certainly worth it to me for those reasons. But I’ll test it out this year and downgrade if I feel it hasn’t been worth it. 

I feel that Delta has yet to make the Reserve card a true top tier travel card that commands the $550 annual fee compared to the Amex Platinum. Way kore value for money with the Amex Platinum and many Delta benefits. If you want the free checked bag and Main 1 boarding just get the gold SkyMiles card and the Amex platinum.

delta,"I’ve had it for about 7 years. I’m a consultant that typically flies on average 3 weeks out of the month from my home base of Atlanta. The reasons the hefty annual fee are worth it:

-SkyClub access.  Invaluable to me since I’m guaranteed to use at least on my outbound trip. Smaller places like Omaha or Norfolk Va obviously don’t have clubs so if you fly into smaller markets this won’t be a perk that’s useful. Since the summer, I’ve thankfully been flying into larger markets where SkyClubs are present. It’s made flying much more enjoyable especially when departure delays happen (EWR, I’m looking directly at you 😳).
-MQM boost. Since I typically have direct flights and my clients are on the east coast, I can’t count on segments or mileage to get me much status. This card helps that-a lot.
-extra opportunities to earn miles on delta through spending esp. if booking directly with Delta.

As far as the companion certificate, most everyone I know (including me) don’t ever use it bc of the restrictions it places (class of ticket, availability of eligible flights). Honestly, I accrue miles pretty easily and quickly so my partner and I fly for free using tickets booked with miles several times a years.

Also, I don’t see much advantage as far as upgrades go. I’m Gold currently on the verge of becoming Platinum. But since I fly out of Atlanta where there are sooooo many Diamonds, best I can ever hope for is an occasional bump to C+. I haven’t been upgraded to first for any flight in I don’t even remember how long, even when flying very expensive coach fares.

Just note, in January the annual fee is going up to $550 from 450. Don’t know your destinations to know if these are worth the price of having the card. For me, it makes sense.

I still would rather give up food and drinks and have more pitch between seats and have wider seats. I'm 5'10"" and every European economy seat I've been on has forced me to it side-saddle in order to keep my knees outside of the aisle. Also, my shoulders hang way over into the seats next to me.

I will say though that the integration between AF, KLM, and Alitalia and Delta is better than the integration of Lufthansa and United.

There will obviously be a greater pool of Silver Medallions that have achieved that status purely through spend on a card, but who cares? If the airline provides a means by which you can spend your way to status and the value proposition is favorable, then why not? 

At the end of the day Delta is a business and it is a two-way transaction. If the value proposition in your situation is no longer favorable, then by all means make adjustments and/or take your business elsewhere. It's the prudent thing to do.

delta,"I've been silver for each of the past three years. I think there are definite benefits. Are they as good as the benefits that come from gold or above? No, but that's to be expected. The best way to compare is not to the other medallion benefits but to having no medallion at all.

In any case, for me, I would rank the benefits as follows:

1) Pick exit row seats with no added charge
2) Upgrades
3) Dedicated customer service number

When they happen, the upgrades are definitely awesome but, as a silver, you just have to manage your expectations there. I fly out of RDU so, as a Silver, I fairly frequently get Comfort+ and I occasionally get First Class. If you fly out of ATL or another hub as a silver, you probably won't get upgraded much as those airports tend to be full of higher level medallions.

I use the exit row seat selection option nearly 100% of the flights I book, so that's why I rank it as #1. It just provides the most overall value for me. 

The dedicated number is kind of handy when things go awry but you'll still have a pretty significant wait time if there's a big weather event. But, it's still better than the general number so it's worth noting.

There's also the free bag but I almost never check bags so that's pretty ""meh"" for me in terms of utility.

TL;DR Silver is definitely better than nothing but clearly not as good as Gold or above. For me, at least, it has absolutely had value but it likely depends a lot on your specific travel tendencies.",1571156093.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/di93nj/what_value_do_you_get_from_silver_medallion/,9,9,0,t3_bfh933

I have three cell phones so it happens at least twice a year that I leave one behind, I fly 8-10 times a month and I’m exhausted it happens. (don’t judge) 

Most of the time my items have been returned and all I had to do was file the missing items report with AA.  I have  been called without even realizing I have left something behind. 

I will say that someone has to find it first, assume that it’s something that should be turned in, not tossed and then wait for airline workers to deliver it to the lost and found.  I left a cell phone that I had turned  completely off fully charged in the backseat.  2  days later I get a notification that it was turned on in a terminal in another part of the country, at this point I start tracking it. 2 days later it finally died still sitting in the terminal, 2 days later I got the  notification it was found. 6 days from when I left the phone for it to be found.

americanairlines,"> crying and  talking loudly to my friend seats away.

I'm completely sympathetic to your medical condition but this is probably the behavior that got you ejected. Once your behavior begins to unreasonably impact other passengers or the aircraft, you're not fit to fly. The context here is really important. ""Crying and talking loudly"" over a relatively routine plane delay is bad, but if your friend was further than across the aisle or adjacent to you, you were affecting other passengers. If you were unable to control yourself, then you may not have been fit to fly that day -- just as with any other passenger with a medical condition that couldn't be reasonably accommodated.

> the panic attack was due to the entire situation of literally landing  back in the same airport 30 minutes later for the same issue they took 8  hours to fix and delay the plane with lack of communication. 

I wouldn't say this is a daily occurrence for every traveler but this is fairly common in aviation. Problems crop up and sometimes your travel plans can get broken. You'll want to make sure you can handle stress like this before you try to fly again. What would have happened if the plane made an emergency landing or there was smoke in the cockpit?

If you do it too early, and the plane actually arrives on time or they are able to swap an aircraft, then you have to wait for people because passengers will have likely changed their schedules to account for the delay.  That can be spending extra time getting food, taking seats on other flights that could have been sold, or even cancelling their reservations completely.

Likewise if you do it too late then you run the risk of not being able to rebook passengers or causing a mad rush down line of people at customer service trying to accommodate people.

americanairlines,"First I want to apologize for your travel experience on American. Unfortunately, it seems that you faced a snowball effect due to the original weather cancellation. In regard to not receiving your bag at night, it is likely that the airport didn’t have the ground staff to accommodate retrieving your bag. I wish that wasn’t the case, but often times once you give up your bag, it can be a struggle to get it back in a timely fashion. 

I think it is more likely customer relations will offer you miles or a travel voucher, rather than hotel reimbursement in this case (however it never hurts to ask!).

Customer relations may be able to retrieve your eTicket number if you have your confirmation number (6 letters). However, the easiest place to find it would be in your email if you booked on AA.com.

americanairlines,"Absolutely. AA will accommodate schedule changes that they initiated and move you to a new flight, regardless of your ticket type. 
You're also eligible for a refund if you'd like, since the schedule change was over 2 hours.

1. Check AA.com for the flight you'd like to take, looms like there are two nonstop options that day.

2. Call up AA @ 800-433-7300 or DM @americanair on Twitter. Provide your confirmation, brief description of the request, and the new flight(s) you want.

3. Double check the confirmation code to make sure the ticket was reissued correctly.

4. If there's any trouble, ask the agent to reference Americans schedule change policy, which in part says:

Change in flight time only - no change to original flight dates, origin and destination cities, inventory, fare, or fare basis:

If not suitable, may also re-book first available AA flight either earlier or later than the originally scheduled flight time, or one day prior or up to 2 days after the original schedule flight time. 

May change their continuing or return travel dates to maintain the original length of stay prior to the re- accommodation.

I didn't buy insurance at check out so they ain't refunding my Main Cabin no matter what. UNLESS you're saying I can get something back???


Agent told me to just not show up and buy a new one way back in the way I want. One way was cheaper than $200 but I ended up going with Southwest for the flight back because it's even more cheap ($65). Either way I was going to lose the original inbound ticket money. But by not even removing my name from the inbound flight without charging me $200, they can't sell that seat. AA isn't necessarily losing anything but they could have gained something by not charging me to officially withdraw from the flight.

I said, ""Look, you changed my flight twice, and this is Christmas day, which really messes with my Christmas plans, would it be possible to just go home the next day?"" She said, ""Sure, do you want to just go on that \[whatever time it was\] flight?"" And that was EXACTLY when I wanted to go because no way did I want to wake up on the Loop and get the train to O'Hare at 6 a.m. or something. And it wasn't just her. I had another flight change--it wasn't TO O'Hare but it was traveling through there as a connection (I love Chicago), and was the same flight; they basically switched the schedule and that flight at an ideal time, no longer exists, so when I was changing that one, I asked about the other one. I asked then if I could come home the next day from the Chicago trip and she said yes. I ended up not deciding that day because once you decide, then that's it again. By the time I called back, the flight had changed AGAIN! Also, on the first flight I had changed, she asked me if I wanted to go back the next day--on that one I did NOT because my hotel is quite expensive. So they really give you some leeway.

americanairlines,"I read this this morning before work, and I just finished reading the myriad comments posted since then, and, frankly, this is so ridiculous. There is never ONLY a basic economy option when you buy a ticket. Sometimes it comes down to only a business class option or only a main cabin option. Sometimes basic economy tickets are even the ones sold out, but there are never ONLY basic economy tickets available. And when you do click basic economy, there’s an extra screen, that asks you if you’re sure and if you want to move to the main cabin so that you can have seat selection, as well as the option to change your ticket later (for a few). On all American flights, you can buy a nicer seat for a fee, and that is at pretty much any time. I have Gold elite status, and one of the benefits is being able to select seats with extra legroom for free, but I can’t do that on my level until 24 hours before my flight. If I want one of those seats right now, I have to pay a fee. If I wait until 24 hours before, which is check in, I can have one for free. That’s how it works. I don’t want to pay a fee. So I am going to wait. I’m not on Reddit complaining about that. In fact, I actually think that’s kind of cool that I have a choice. If you don’t want to take responsibility for your actions, that is totally your choice, but don’t blame the airline. Yes, all flights on all airlines sometimes overbook, and that is a common, whether unethical or not, practice. But you can find out all about that on other websites. You would have to boycott ALL airlines to avoid that. However, most of those overbooked flights, take volunteers to give up their seats, and they pay those volunteers with free hotel vouchers and hundreds of dollars worth of airline vouchers, as well as re-booking on the next flight, which is something that I will be first in line to volunteer for, so I think it’s a pretty good deal. As for your basic economy flight, you will have a seat. It might be a middle seat. But that’s what you get when you buy a basic economy ticket. This is the reason that I only buy main cabin tickets. I am not willing to sit in a middle seat. So I get what I pay for as well.

Just posting a few links in case they provide any helpful information and answer frequent questions. Happy to answer any travel questions at dawn.gilbertson@usatoday.com

Bottom line:  No, you don't have to pay for a seat with any kind of ticket, including basic economy.  They have to assign you one for free at check in or at the airport. But airlines are increasingly trying to get (scare?) travelers to pay for an advance seat assignment with regular economy tickets and basic economy tickets, and the prices can be steep.   

You can opt to pay for a seat assignment during booking (including Basic Economy bookings on United) or a week before your trip when buying a basic economy ticket on American or Delta.

ie. family, friend, or someone in your class. 
Not sure if they gave you an official list to study yet, but if they didn’t just google “AA airport destinations”  and it should give you something to start with.

I remember helping someone learn airport codes for AS and I hated that the state of Alaska had so many airports, a few study sessions at Starbucks though and managed to memorize enough.

It’s been over 36 hrs for me so I’m getting nervous. 

It’s been hard since not only do I have to fly back home with no I.D, I have to drive about two hours home from the airport once I land also with no ID or emergency funds.  I’m also worried about possibility of identity theft and loss of memorable items.

Maybe the airport you landed at was staffed by people who actually care because everyone I spoke to EWR was rude, which really added to my negative situation :/ 

What made me more upset was that I had gone back within an hour of losing it. I feel surely they could have made a phone call to the cleaning crew, gate agent, somebody to try and locate it. I feel that they didn’t even try and told me I was shit out of luck which is why I’m more upset.

The last day I had booked two tickets separately because of how my reimbursements were happening. So when I checked a bag in Guadeloupe I asked if I could send it to my final destination, but they said no bc it was a separate ticket. I was bummed, bc I didn't want to pay twice to check it, but it is what it is. 


After I cleared customs in Miami I had to re-check it and I chatted with agent. I had given myself a long layover because I know Miami is busy, so I wasn't rushed. I asked how her day was and listened to why she was excited for her day off. I was just making small talk. When I expected her to ask for payment she just handed me a check claim and smiled and wished me a nice trip. I never even asked if she could waive the fee, she just did.


Thing is, people who rarely fly don't know the little details-which airports to schedule long layovers in, what time of year to avoid Chicago blizzards or southern thunderstorms. They're also maybe nervous about flying and on edge. Because they don't fly much they might worry about getting ripped off or taken advantage of by the company. No excuse to be mean, but maybe the rest of us can help them calm down without judging them too harshly. Idk.

They always found me very quickly.  There is something off here. I’m not saying that you are telling us something off, but there is definitely something that happened that is not the fault of the airlines giving you bad customer service either. It also may not be too late to do something about this if there was an airline mistake. But you probably need to talk to somebody in person. $600 to Madrid in August was probably a basic economy fare, but occasionally, people do not get their final email confirmation, and if you have not at some point received that final email confirmation with your ticket, then you are not ticketed. But if you are not ticketed, you are also not charged. It is the passenger’s responsibility to follow up and confirm that ticket. A couple of times, mine has taken longer than the usual hour, but when I look on the American website, I can login and see the word “ticketed” appears. If that word does not appear, you were not ticketed. And it is definitely your responsibility to check prior to departure date. So in this case, the responsibility really was on you. I do feel for you, being a college student, and probably an inexperienced flyer and it sucks to learn this lesson, but after you get back, if you’re not already, you need to figure out what happened and if you were charged.

You pay the price I quote and chose your menu based on my famous chef’s presented offerings. You pay another company to provide the wine pairings based on this menu and you chose a bakery to provide the perfect accompanying dessert. 

Day of the wedding, I call you to tell you that I’m unable to replicate the menu because the chef is no longer with the company, but I’ll try to give your guests SOMETHING to eat. So sorry about the wines being off or the dessert not quite fitting in. As compensation, I’ll give you a credit towards a future event. 

Do you still have a wedding reception despite my failure to deliver what you were promised and paid for? Of course you do-what choice do you have? 

Will you sue despite the fact that I still gave you food? Probably, lol. 

Point is, American knew it would be unlikely to successfully deliver its product and failed to tell its customers until the very last minute and at a time where changes were almost impossible.

americanairlines,"In terms of flight loads, there are generalities (days of the week, times of the year, etc) which tend to be true.  There are never any guarantees though and there are other possible factors.  There could be snow related issues departing and returning in the United States during your travel period (delays, cancellations, sudden influx of passengers on to your desired flight, etc).  There are also issues related to peak times that freight is being shipped.  I have a work colleague who was not boarded a flight departing Buenos Aires due to the amount of freight being shipped.  All confirmed passengers were on, but the flight departed with 30+ seats empty due to the amount of cargo in the cargo bin.  I think this was either December or January.  I don't work for AA, so perhaps their rules are different.

In the end of the day it is about risk vs reward and also risk tolerance.  A buddy pass is at the bottom of the standby list, so you have to be ok with changing your travel itinerary, not going or perhaps even paying full fare to get home.

Even though he’s transitioning through the company for like Piedmont to American, he has to have a new seniority hire date to whichever new company he was hired on.
If that’s the case, then he would have to complete his probationary period before he can register guests & issue them buddy passes.

You may have to change your travel dates if his probation period overlaps with your estimated travel dates and when I was with Piedmont, doing something irresponsible like no-call-no-show can extend such probation and postpone the date they are allowed to issue those buddy passes. If that conflicts with your travel plans, then I suggest looking now to book tickets yourself.

americanairlines,"  

I've been reading your post, and your accusations that all the downvotes were AA employees or shills. I have a lot to say, and this won't be short, but I hope you will consider some of these factors. So just so you know, I do not work for AA, and I won't even be an Elite member for a few weeks, though I did set out to earn Gold this year and will easily achieve that. I have flown 29 segments between January and August. During the April-July months, I did encounter some late planes, but nothing terrible. I missed ONE connection, which wasn't cool, but they did rebook me to an airport 45 minutes from home so I could avoid waiting 6 hours for the next flight. I landed an hour or so later than scheduled. It should be noted I live in a rather rural area and we only have American Eagle here, so we get no special service.

You continue to cite articles about AA's bad summer of the mechanics' battle and the delays. Those articles were very real, and I have cited them myself when asking for compensation. However, there are updates, and as you can see from this article: [https://viewfromthewing.com/2019/09/06/americans-internal-memo-on-the-miami-mechanic-who-sabotages-a-plane/](https://viewfromthewing.com/2019/09/06/americans-internal-memo-on-the-miami-mechanic-who-sabotages-a-plane/)

Those numbers are much improved (see bottom) just two months later than what you cite (Gary Leff's posting of AA data is from an internal AA memo--he has a source there). Anecdotally, I can vouch for this. I am an AV geek who lives close enough to my airport that I can easily make it part of my daily drive. Whenever I can swing it, I drive by the airport to see planes land or take off, so I know the schedule by heart. I can actually--literally--count on one hand the number of times flights have been canceled since June. In fact, I can almost set my clock by their schedule. I don't go every day, but I look virtually every day. Most flights have been running EARLY. There was a week a couple weeks ago when they were running late for the evening flight almost every day. But amazingly, despite being super late incoming flights at DFW, they still got here and took off within 10-15 minutes. Only once in the past couple months was a flight seriously delayed, and that's because they have a failure on board of a major system (that kept the AC running; it's hot) so they had to send the flight back to DFW. Amazingly, they STILL changed planes and came back. 

Every time I have a major problem, I reach out to AA and they help. When I have had late flights at DFW earlier in the year, I would call and ask for alternate flights, and they would schedule me a BACK UP flight with a confirmed seat, without canceling my original flight in case I still made it. One time the only available seat on another flight included first class DFW to ORD, and she put me on it for FREE (again, I am NOT elite yet). I have no connection to AA. They are far FAR from perfect. I have been very upset with them. I can name the rudest gate agent ever at DFW who, when I asked her her name, informed me it was \_\_\_ and she was the ONLY one in the airport (she said it with so much attitude it was obvious I was not the first to demand her name). 

But I can tell you about Dawn Hune, a gate agent at MCI, who is the kindest and most helpful woman. I only know her name because I asked her supervisor how I could give her a shout out after I saw a woman gripe at her and be completely illogical and unreasonable as Dawn tried to do EVERYTHING in her power to help this lady--without charge (that was the same day I missed my connection due to a mechanical issue that was a big deal that day). 

Airlines are made up of people. For every jerky agent, there are a million more Dawn Hunes. I look for that woman now whenever I fly to MCI. I hear United passengers gripe as well. And even Delta--though usually Delta is on time--but don't tell that to my young friend who had a canceled Delta connection to her first trip to Amsterdam, then had to take a taxi from DAL to DFW (NOT cheap), then take a different flight, connect in a different city, pay for her OWN hotel since they would not put her on a flight til the next day, and lost a day of her vacation. Her compensation? A $200 GIFT CARD for Amazon. Meanwhile, I took a trip to Europe on AA--my flight there was exactly on time, on a Dreamliner. And my flight back to ORD was scheduled to be 9 hours and only took 7:45--also on a Dreamliner. Two of the best long flights of my life.

Yes, there are delays. Yes, this mechanics battle is out of hand. Yes, the Max issue has caused problems for airlines. BTW, Southwest also had the same issues, including the mechanics, and has canceled tons of flights and changed and canceled whole routes this year. We hear less griping because their FA are trained to be funny and happy and wonderful. People experience happy flights, but I don't trust an airline that just cancels a bunch of routes--while they add Hawaii to the list. Basically, that's what it's about. Yes, I want AA to do what it does best and copy United's Connection Saver. Yes, I am flying again in a few days and I worry that weather or a broken seat could hurt me. But that's not unique to AA, and all the ranting and raving in the world won't make it so.

Your experience has been AWFUL. No one would argue with that. And I have to say, my friends this year who have been on AA in major CA airports have probably had more problems than most. I fly mostly DFW, ORD, and MCI, sometimes SAN or MSP. AA flies to the most US locations. Delta and United cannot get me to some of my regular places for a good price or connection. We're talking $300 on AA and $600 on Delta. I had a conversation with Delta about it and it has to do with airports, hubs, connections, etc. For now, that's the way it is. So I settled in and decided to go for elite. I have been treated well more often than not. I have not been upgraded randomly as there are not really the seats for it. I haven't had a lot of perks, but when flight schedules change, they reschedule me for free, basically when I want to go (I book important trips over 6 months out sometimes, so schedules change often for me that early). I have never had any SERIOUS trouble. I also book all my trips on a credit card that has trip delay insurance--which I have not had to use. I prepare myself for delays--if I have the last flight out of the hub airport to my connecting town I always carry on clean clothes and toiletries in case. I check my travel portals and apps for a room I can book cheap or on points, and I know I will be covered by my credit card (I use Chase cards for this). So far I have not ended up needing it. 

So you can dump AA and call us all shills. You have a valid complaint and nightmare stories, but you can no more generalize your story than I can say since all the flights are going on time from my town they must be in other places. I am an academic and qualitative researcher and one principle in case study research, which your stories are, is that it cannot be generalized to a population. 

I TRULY am sorry you have had such awful experiences. Please take it up with the email link to customer service. In one case it did take me three emails because of the busyness, but once they reply the first time, you can tell the whole story via email--or you can call. I don't understand when people say they can't call to ask for help. I have two AA numbers programmed in my phone and call anytime I need something like that. Be polite, be professional, don't call them shills. Remember the agent in email or on the phone did NOT cause your problem, is probably overwhelmed with angry customers, and yet has some latitude to help make it better. I have been short before, and I say, ""I'm sorry! I know you didn't cause this, and I am just frustrated, but I don't want to take it out on you."" They are all humans. They aren't trying to make you miserable, so give them a chance. If you never want to fly AA again, well, thank God it's a choice you have, but I suspect it will be harder on you if your regular travel takes you through any of their hubs. Delta and United are just more limited for many flights. I have thousands upon thousands of United miles and priority boarding, their credit card, etc. but so far, no occasion to actually FLY UA! I will likely use those miles on Star Alliance flights. Meanwhile, I will be over on AA, mostly going where I need to when I need to, and knowing that if something happens, at least they care enough to fix it. 

tl;dr  All the airlines have their issues, but AA has improved dramatically since summer. I have the opposite experience than you, and neither can be generalized. I like AA, and am sticking around. But I'm truly sorry for your genuinely awful experience this trip.",1568351538.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/d3cl6g/the_horror_story_continues/,9,9,0,t3_bfh933

I think a lot of the downvotes just comes from content that doesn't contribute to the sub in a positive manner, and are entirely combative and dismissive of other posters. This isn't for AA employees and is mostly visited by frequent flyers. Plenty of us fly a hundred plus flights a year or hundreds of thousands of miles. Hearing about other delays and cancellations isn't any more enjoyable than experiencing our own. That's not what people would prefer to see on this sub. A lot of people want to see news about the fleet, changes to the frequent flyer program, SAAver & upgrade availability when people find it, and information about maximizing all the shitty travel we have to do. If I'm gonna fly that much for work, you're gonna be damn sure I'm gonna get some cool vacations out of it. 

I would love it if we could have stickied weekly experience threads where people could post about positive negative experiences and leave most new threads to news information and for threads about helping people in predicaments or who have questions about the intricacies of the FF program.

I’ll admit I wasn’t happy - it was the last flight of the day (perhaps they were trying to save on overnight accommodations?) Eventually we ended up around 90 minutes late. The kicker is that only 1 of the 4 people we waited on made the connection. 

You can call me the grinch, but waiting longer was the last thing I wanted to do. Especially since I had to fly in and out same day.

americanairlines,">Is award availability an issue.

Depends on when you book and the route you're trying to get. The sooner you can book, the better. I generally try to grab award flights 4-6 months out; after that, availabilities can get real tight, especially on more popular travel days (weekends).

>If you are short in points, is buying points the only option

If you want to book something *now* and don't have enough miles, then yes. Consider if it's worth it (you're paying a *lot* more than the miles are typically worth when buying directly, but if you're only short by a little bit and are booking a nice business class seat on a route that's typically very expensive, then it can be worth it).

If you have some time, you can get an easy 50-60,000 miles by opening the AA Citi and/or AA Barclay credit cards (note that these cards have an annual fee, and for the Citi card, you need to meet the minimum spend to get the miles). [This portal](https://www.aa.com/i18n/aadvantage-program/miles/earn/earn-miles.jsp) also has other ways to earn miles, including shopping, car rentals, and hotels, but these take a while to accumulate.",1567919970.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/d16d9e/redeeming_aa_miles_for_international_flights/,1,1,0,t3_bfh933

You can change her seats, change flights etc., but cannot merge the reservation (without cancelling existing ones and reissuing the PNR), and can only get comp E+ by calling/messaging them.

Regarding club admission, you can bring 2 guests if you are a member (one of them can be a child under 21). If you are not a member (I am not, and I typically access it before INTL flights), you can only bring one guest. The guest does not need to be related; I have brought friends and colleagues with me. If they're letting you in with a spouse and two kids, it's probably out of courtesy but I don't think it's by the rules: https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/airport/united-club-and-lounges/rules.html

So it sounds like you're right - there's no backend marriage of the tickets, but they can comp the $60 seat upgrade fee if you call in and explain the situation, I guess.

What's extra weird, is it let me book her reservation under *my* MileagePlus account (on the website - not for actual mileage earning). When I used to fly Southwest, their site definitely didn't do that - it only would put things under me that had my rewards number attached to the ticket. Don't know if this will make it any easier for United to comp the fee once they see the same MP account booked both reservations, since apparently, that's logged.

(As an aside - last year I was looking to book a SFO-CDG.  It seems like the price would go up the more I looked, and if I didn't look for a couple days the prices would be lower - though surely just my one-person searches couldn't have affected the algorithm's perception of demand that much.

@WeFlyFrequently

all jokes aside, you are definitely not the first to ask, as many of my Amex Plat and Chase SR cardholder friends asked.

So perhaps the biggest reason is I was somehow targeted with AF waived AND included a 50k miles bonus. (*I just learned about the 50K bonus from an agent I spoke with today, he said I was the first he have seen so far. But still need to wait on the physical terms & condition to verify*)

I am also an United frequent flyer with a premier Gold status. All the airports I fly to is basically united dominated. If there was a star alliance or PP lounge at the airport, I'd have to go to different terminal and go through TSA again! That's just hella time consuming.

As a Platinum, my RPUs are currently useless. I've requested 5 upgrades this year and never even got into single digits on the list (I think the closest was #12). Remember, this is with using a RPU. 

I was thinking of switching to Delta this year after a status match (Korean air + Air France is a great combo and Delta usually does okay with partner flights, including allowing me to pick seats while purchasing the tickets!) 

I will probably stick to United for another year and another platinum, at least I can get a one way business class ticket from IAD to NRT to BKK out of this. Sweet flight for business, I'd say the best in star alliance though EVA be looking at us hard. 

Need to get my address moved overseas, that PQD lift to $15k is hitting me hard. I'll get around $12k and almost 200k miles.

unitedairlines,"I have a few thoughts. Bottom line is I like the change and for most people it's a big upgrade.

Now domestic road warrior 1ks don't need to worry about ""wasting"" GPUs on domestic upgrades/p.s. upgrades. They simply cost less so more of those upgrades are available. Opening up lower Deep Discount economy fare classes below W (S, T, L, K, G) for upgrade to Polaris, as well as the ""Skip Waitlist"" option for 1Ks and GS both sound very enticing and promising. Time will tell how often Skip Waitlist is available in reality.

In exchange for the buff we are losing out on a lot of flexibility that came with GPUs. For GPUs, if an upgrade request contained a domestic and Polaris international portion, if the domestic upgrade cleared but Polaris failed then the GPU would be refunded. This is no longer the case: in the same scenario, now 20 PlusPoints will be deducted for the cleared portion. Also, flyers cannot game the system by waiting for the Polaris portion to clear and ""extending"" the request to include the domestic portion. Once a segment is confirmed, there is no undoing it. A domestic upgrade in that case would require 20 PlusPoints.

Along the same vein there is no more changing upgrades on flights for which upgrades have been confirmed. Once confirmed, points will be forfeited if the customer wants to change their flight. This is offset by the unlimited number of requests that can be made and points won't be deducted until clearing. 

Finally I should mention this opens the door to a big devaluation down the road. It's easy to raise the requirement to 50/60 PlusPoints for Polaris or some other diabolical combination. This is definitely a scary thought.

Overall I think the good outweighs the bad. We lose flexibility in some areas, gain it in others. Skip Waitlist function sounds very promising indeed but we'll need to wait and see on that.

unitedairlines,"The economics of airlines has always been interesting to me. Load factors are generally not all that is relevant. A better indicator is ""Who and What is flying and to where?"" and ""What are they paying?"" Red eye flights are largely leisure travelers, but the airplane that is used to fly overnight is unlikely to generate more profit anywhere else, even at 50% load. Supply of aircraft exceeds demand during overnight hours. Plus, it could be needed to reposition the crew or the aircraft itself, and/or be carrying mail/cargo that is far more valuable with an evening departure.

&#x200B;

While the day time flight from PDX-IAD has a high load factor, that is a peak time. The question United has to ask is ""This is a successful route, but could this aircraft make *more* money flying elsewhere?"" If the aircraft is flying PDX-IAD in the morning, then it can't fly a more profitable (say LAX-SFO) route during the same time. At 8am in PDX, demand for aircraft nationwide exceeds supply.

&#x200B;

If it's flying PDX-IAD overnight, then as soon as it lands it can fly a more profitable (say IAD-BOS) route and hit the ground running (instead of sitting overnight in PDX without making any money). Toss in mail/cargo and the passengers - largely leisure who just want the cheap fare - are only there to put butts in seats. And they can all connect around the world for departures all day at IAD.

unitedairlines,"There are a few reasons. The gate agents now have an app that tells them how many bags have to be checked. It's not always correct. If the plane started boarding late and they need to get the plane out, sometimes they will check the remaining bags to expedite the boarding process. It also depends on how many agents are working the flt. A lot of times when the flt is staffed properly with agents, and there isn't anything crazy going at the counter, one of the agents will walk down and check with the flight attendants to see about how many more bags they can take. If understaffed or an agent is helping passengers at the counter then they have to make a guess off of the count the computer program told them. Now the flight attendant's are instructed NOT to remove the tags and NOT to allow them on the plane. Boarding group 5 is all Basic Economy seats. That boarding group is not allowed to bring any carry-on bags on(only 1 personal bag that goes under the seat). Also the flight attendants don't know if your bag was placed in a sizer and told it was too big. When a plane is boarded with too many bags it causes delays. Bags go all the way to the back of the plane, you have to wait for everyone to board and get out of the aisle. The cargo door can't close because they are waiting for bags on the plane. Since delays cost the company more money then checking bags.... they check more bags then necessary sometimes. 
A suggestion is if you get to the plane you can ask the flight attendant at the door if there is still room for bags. If they say yes(maybe ask how many more and help other passengers out) you can bring your bag back to the agent and say the flight attendants said they have room for about X number of bags can I please remove my tag and bring it on. More then likely if they were using the computer they will remove the tag. If it's because of time or they are frazzled (it happens to all of us) then it's getting checked.
Also another reason the flight attendants can not take the tag off is there is also an issue with the cargo count. Their computer says that they should have 20 bags and there are only 19. They have to try and find a bag, possibly delaying the flt. There are also people that get their bag tagged and then take the tag off. When they get to their final destination they claim that the company lost the bag and now want compensation for it.",1568506973.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/d1hfoo/the_false_premise_of_full_overhead_bins_in_order/,2,2,0,t3_bfh933

2) If you’re a small to average build person, Basic might be OK for a long-haul flight if you are accustomed to it. If the basic section is only half-full at the time if the flight, then you may have the chance to stretch out a bit and not need a plus seat,

3) I believe that they give you the opportunity to upgrade online to Economy Plus all the way up to the day of the flight or when the E+ seats are gone, whichever comes first. If the plus seats become more scarce as time draws near, the price of the upgrade might get pretty far up there since demand is clearly in the airline’s favor.

&#x200B;

United, which has a major hub at SFO, accounted for 45% of the airport’s traffic last year, the most of any airline. In July, United reduced the number of flights scheduled for the September construction period by 10% and rebooked customers on the canceled flights, said airline spokeswoman Maddie King. 

United introduced a larger 777 aircraft between SFO and Los Angeles International Airport daily to reduce flight numbers. It is also diverting some flights to the San Jose airport and busing customers to SFO. They’re also sending text notifications and updates to affected passengers.

Alaska Airlines, the second-largest SFO operator, said it trimmed its flight schedule and added extra time between flights. The airline is not offering travel waivers but said it will closely monitor the impact of the runway work and make adjustments if needed.

American Airlines, which operated 8% of SFO flights last year, reduced its flight schedule by 15%. The airline issued a travel alert and let customers whose flights were canceled or rescheduled make additional changes or request a refund without additional fees, said spokesman Curtis Blessing.

Southwest reduced its schedule by about 10%, said spokesman Dan Landson, and proactively canceled 11 departures Monday. The airline is working to get customers to destinations as quickly as possible and offering flexible accommodations to change to other California destinations.

Delta was the first to push for this, but United [pushed aggressively to make things worse starting in 2017.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_economy ) In fact, looking this up now, United actually lost revenue after the plan was implemented precisely because of what I'm describing:

>United Airlines announced its basic economy fares in November 2016 and began selling these tickets in early 2017. These fares do not include overhead baggage space nor earn elite miles.[9][10] Grant Martin of Skift described United's roll-out of basic economy fares as ""the most widespread and aggressive"" of the three major US full-service carriers. United revealed plans to reduce its basic economy offerings in November 2017, due to revenue loss resulting from customers opting for other airlines that price-matched United without basic economy restrictions.[11] However, United announced an expansion of basic economy fares in January 2018,[12] and introduced basic economy on transatlantic flights in June that year.

I've avoided basic economy precisely because the price is higher for every united option the moment I select 'allow a carry-on bag.' Is everyone here honestly booking the premium flight options every time or what? Just doing a quick search for flights between BWI and LAX (to pick tow random airports I don't normally fly to), I see that Spirit is cheapest, Untied and Delta are tied, but Delta allows carryons and United does not. This is the fourth set of airports I've checked today where United offers inferior deals while giving the false impression that their rate and benefits are equivalent. Yes, of course you have to read the fine print or check off extra options to allow carryons, but this is a relatively recent change in the past couple of years.

I think it depends on where you are looking to fly. Different airlines may have better rates based on their routes. 

Also UA didn't spearhead basic economy. This has been a factor for budget airlines for a long time. And what Basic Economy includes is on their site when you choose it. If you don't read then no one can help you. People who complain about ""tricky"" pricing have to remember that this is literally how you get cheap airfare. Things like charging for checked bags, extra legroom, etc is the global model these days. Without it prices could be twice as high possibly and less people would travel. 

>It's basically impossible to achieve gold or elite status

I have no idea what you're talking about I just requalified for 1K this month. Most people choose an airline to be loyal to in order to get status. If you are flying different airlines all the time then it will be hard to get status.

If you look at their fair codes online you can plainly see which fare codes accumulate the most miles.  They didn't ""spearhead "" the basic economy movement. It was something all the major airlines have done to compete against the LLC airlines. If anything I would say American has taken it farther than most.

As for the obese people sitting next to you. What did you expect they could do?  They can't discriminate against larger people no matter how uncomfortable it is for you. No different an any other airline. They would be asking for a lawsuit.

It sounds like you are just whining without really doing your homework.

&#x200B;

Lastly, if you are using an airline mileage card over a specific major credit card to get points for travel, you are just doling it wrong. There are credit cards in both Canada and the US that have way better returns for points and can be used with any airline.",1567623390.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/czooku/does_anyone_else_find_that_united_consistently/,3,3,0,t3_bfh933

You can check this when you get to the trip summary after selecting your flights and then clicking the text that says ""view fare rules and restrictions"". If you build one itinerary selecting plain economy and then the same one with flexible economy and compare the  fare basis codes it gives you, they'll be the same. What that means is that all fares in HKG have lenient enough penalties to be considered ""flexible"", but that doesn't mean they're fully refundable. To see what the exact restrictions are, scroll down on the same fare rules and restrictions screen to the section that says ""penalties"". If you can get through the technical jargon it tells you what kind of flexibility you have.  There's usually a fee for cancels/changes.

AMEX is the same - but you get 5 points, so you would have gotten 125k points.  Their partners are different but some overlap.

Chase Sapphire Reserve.  You get 3 points for dining/travel and a bunch of benefits like Priority Pass.  You can then get 1.5x in rewards (which makes it like 4.5 points) or have a bunch of transfer partners.  I suggest this card.

AMEX Plat- 5 points but less benefits (subjective- if you live in a Centurion lounge airport or NYC or often incur non-ticket charges on airlines, you may benefit from this.

Then it gets more nuanced.  If you do a lot of Marriott stays (at least 35 a year), I'd get the Bonvoy card.  I'd probably get the Chase vs AMEX one, especially if you already have CSR or AMEX Plat.  The biggest thing with Marriott is you want to hit Platinum status, which needs 50 nights OR 35 nights + the credit card OR 25 nights + credit card + booking a meeting room.

No matter what airline caused the loss of bag, or seems to have had the bag last, it is the responsibility of your final carrier to get the bag to you, regardless of who you booked with.

As for the $1500 for lost baggage, United handles this on their side. If United was your last carrier, a claim needs to be made on arrival, and your bag tag number needs to be submitted with it. If the bag was located within 3 days, it is considered delayed, not lost, and is not eligible. However, if it was located within the 3 days, but was not forwarded by the 6th day it may still be eligible.

But here’s what. With all the delay, I got to Ottawa. I’ve been here at the airport for the past hour. Guess what? The cargo door is stuck and all carryons are there (they didn’t let us take any carryon on board).

If your not in the airport try calling United customer service,1565369950.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/cnyy75/6_hour_delay_due_to_mechanical_issues_out_of_dfw/,1,1,0,t3_bfh933
unitedairlines,"Document these occurrences, screenshot your app notifications that explain delay and why. 

This is not an AOG event but a direct United problem which they are at fault for, which is why this will work out favorable for you if you handle it the right way. 

When you get home, get some rest and when you're level headed the next day send United an email and they will more than likely take care of you. 

Asking for mileage credit, United Club passes, economy plus upgrades, or even voucher credit is possible. 

Stay calm, cool, collected and friendly. This method always wins the day.

My brother was supposed to fly in tomorrow morning to EWR from Tampa and they cancelled his flight due to severe weather. There is NO SEVERE WEATHER IN SIGHT! Not here and not in Tampa. They gave him an option to fly a connecting flight that will last 9 hours or so with two kids. JetBlue apparently has no problems with flying into EWR and several other airlines are flying into other airports around NYC. This caused him to cancel his entire trip costing him and me wasted precious vacation days.

But when they say “extreme weather” that doesn’t mean just at the arrival or departure airport, it can be extreme weather through any part of the route your flying. And when a storm cell is large enough you can’t just “go around it” as that could dig into the reserve fuel which is the last thing any pilot would want to do. As for customer service, I’d just stay on the line with them until you get something worked out, in my experiences United’s customer service is a lot better than some other airlines.",1565325516.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/cnnnhw/severe_weather_conditions_secret_code_for_not/,1,1,0,t3_bfh933
