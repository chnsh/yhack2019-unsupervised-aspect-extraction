12 Hour Delay,3,dj3cnd,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/dj3cnd/12_hour_delay/,2,"First time posting, On Mobile. Hope this is the right place to post, sorry for formatting, spelling, grammar, etc. 

So I'm currently sitting in the Denver Airport, settling in to spend the night here until 10 am. 

My flight was suppose to leave at 11:59 pm on Oct 16. But instead a pilot called in sick, apparently only an hour before the flight was suppose to leave and without the second pilot we are unable to leave. 

From my understanding, they attempted to find another pilot but we're unable so now they have to fly in a new crew in the morning. 

So instead of meeting my connecting flight at 6am. I now leave here at 11 am, reach the connecting airport at 430 pm and then get on my new connecting flight at 1030 pm to reach my destination 13 hours later then I originally was suppose too. 

I picked JetBlue because I've previously had no issues with them, in fact my next flight in Nov is booked with them. Something which I regret and I'm almost thinking of cancelling and rebooking with any other airline. 

And tbh, I'm not entirely angry because of the delay. It's frustrating and annoying but what really gets me, is the refusal to get people a place to stay. This isn't a 3 hour delay or even a delay during the day where people have access to transportation, food, etc. It's 2 am and most of us don't live here. We have no place to stay. 

But Hey, at least I got a meal voucher for $8 that doesn't work at McDonald. That I can't use until the restaurants open in like 6 hrs. So ill starve instead.  /s

Update: spent the night at the airport and got my flight in the morning. But now my connecting flight was canceled. And I'm stuck.",1571329358.0

Jetblue #1954 SJU to FLL WTF!!!! Delay,2,cckdvc,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/cckdvc/jetblue_1954_sju_to_fll_wtf_delay/,0,"Flight was scheduled to depart at 9:20pm and the plane arrived from a previous destination on time. No alerts of any delays. Jetblue starts boarding, as usual, but now (at the time the post started) it is 10:56pm with everyone on board and the plane’s doors are still open. “Missing paperwork” they are saying. No water for passengers now for almost two hours. 

Why would you board ppl if you are not ready to leave!!!!!!!!!  It’s starting to get uncomfortable.  And there is no communication to the passengers from the crew other than “missing paperwork”.   I (who is not on the plane) knows of the departure time change before my family member on board. 

They are even saying that you can onboard but only to grab another flight. WTF!!!!!  Ppl from jetblue. Get you shit together and communicate with those passengers. Is now 11:00 and those doors are open!!!

Update 11:15pm:  Door is still open and now they will begin with the service of drinks and snacks (no alcohol, geez). 

And they said that because they started the service, the plane cannot leave the gate until the full service is completed and put away safely. 

Or you might say, buying time.

Update 11:33pm: Still at the gate. But crew just informed the passengers “Our supplies are extremely limited”. More than two hours at a gate you would expect that there is plenty of time to restock. Doors till open.

Update 11:45pm:  Snack and drink service is complete and safely put away. Doors are still open.  Crew is acting all busy asking passengers to close the tables and bring their back of the seat to a straight position like they are ready to depart but doors are still open. ALMOST THREE HOURS ON THE PLANE IN A GATE!!!!!  No maintenance issues, no weather delays.   Just pure irresponsibility and a bad performance by Jetblue.

Jetblue vacations - corporate discounts? Any corporate employees?,2,9tk6iu,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/9tk6iu/jetblue_vacations_corporate_discounts_any/,1,"Do Jetblue corporate employees get access to crazy vacation deals? My friend Kate has been booking vacations through an acquaintance Judy who's friend Charles works for Jetblue corporate. Charles sends Judy these insane vacation deals and Judy passes them on to her friends. When I say insane, I mean like 7 day, all inclusive Caribbean trips (to major resorts) for like $600 including flights and airport transfers. Judy requires cash for the trips, apparently sends the money to Charles who books the trips using his corporate card. The trip vouchers are good for 2 years and you can cancel a booked trip up to 30 days before for a full refund. The prices drop even more if 10+ tickets are purchased.

Something just doesn't seem right. It seems too good. Kate says Judy has be ""doing this for years"", has been a member of the community for 30 years and if she was scamming people, it would be known. I don't know anyone personally that has actually taken a trip but Kate has her first one coming up in November. I know 3 others taking trips in the next few months. Judy claims she doesn't get anything out of it, I would almost believe this more if she just admitted she gets a % cut. Kate asked if this was a timeshare thing and would need to sit through a presentation, Judy said no. Again, I would believe this more if that were the case. For this price, there has to be a catch.

Kate has purchased 4 vacations but my skepticism now has her nervous. If Judy were to get hit by a bus tomorrow, how would all these people reach Charles to book there trips or get refunds? How can Charles just book vacations for all these people? If you show interest in a trip, Judy jumps right on it and then you need to give her money immediately for this great deal. Something just doesn't smell right and I'm wondering if there are any current or former JB corporate employees out there that can vouch for getting amazing vacation deals that can be shared with friends.

"Double booked, only one charge...",2,98l59v,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/98l59v/double_booked_only_one_charge/,0,"So I was just trying to book a flight with JetBlue. I got to the lady screen, hit confirm, and got an error message. Tried a couple more times to no avail. Tried on the app, same deal. Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed. 

Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.

Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts. Not from a morality stand point, thank you; I can make that decision myself and don't need the internet's thoughts on right and wrong. I'd like to hear if anybody knows how this will play out.

They haven’t located my bag so I had to fill out papers with information on my lost luggage. The second page asked for a list of items in my luggage and their receipts. They were all old clothing that I don’t have proof of purchase anymore or the memory of where I bought them. The only articles of clothing I have a receipt of were a air of pants and a sweater from Banana Republic that I had purchased before flying. The only other receipts I had were for my electronics which included a PS4 and a headset as well as three games. So I wrote those down. 

They call me today to tell me that they only compensate for essentials and not electronics so I explained that I have no other receipts and was told that I still had to write the items with the date of purchase and price. When I asked what I should do if I don’t know either of those things, the dude just repeated the thing instead of answering my question. 

They also said that they’d reimburse me for items that I needed to buy due to my lost luggage but only if I bought them within five days after the claim in made. I was way past the five day mark so I can’t even get reimbursement for the new clothing I had to buy. 

So all in all, I have nothing to show to get any reimbursement and I don’t know what to do. I’m a college student with a minimum wage job. I don’t have the money to replace all my lost items. And some were hand made. I don’t know what to do at this point.

This was a 7+ hour flight with no power outlets and no IFE.  At that point id had it with AA.

So for my fall SFO trip, I decided to give JetBlue a try.  However this meant giving up the direct flight and connecting through BOS.  Totally worth it because:

- The gate agents seem to actually care about their customers (Unlike the AA agents who seem to be more interested in their iPhones)

- The on board entertainment options are fantastic (and POWER OUTLETS!) 

- The flight attendants actually seem to care about their jobs (as evidenced by the ""service first"" attitude)

What is the most effective way to complain and/or request reimbursement for the aftermath of a cancelled flight?,2,6ergle,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/6ergle/what_is_the_most_effective_way_to_complain_andor/,0,"I encountered the worst air travel situation yet recently and that's after traveling a bit over the past several years.  I never before had issues with Jetblue, but this past trip was a vacation that almost tanked because of the travel and had me not wanting to ever use them again.  Each of the 4 flights I had going and coming was delayed if not once, several times, then the final returning leg, after being delayed multiple times, even while sitting on the airplane for an hour, was cancelled just before midnight with no other flights going out to my destination until late the next evening.  This forced me, my co-passengers and possibly passengers from what looked like another cancelled Jetblue flight to seek answers and alternatives for what to do at such a time of being stranded.  Many of us were not treated sufficiently and were not presented with acceptable options, which is ridiculous.  Many were families with small children, and by the time I got to a desk to speak to someone and ask questions of what was to happen and what available options were, we were told ""their"" hotels had sold out and the nearest would be an hour away and we would have to find one ourselves, but they would provide transportation.  There's much more to this, but long story short, I ended up staying at a nearby motel to keep costs low in the worst case of being totally rejected and not refunded or compensated for whatever reason, but I still find it reprehensible I was put in this position.  

I want to write a letter explaining this, but I don't want to send it to the wind or to some general or automated email address that will never read it.  Has anyone had success with complaints?

I just got back into town (BOS) from TPA.  When I was down there I figured for the first time ever, I would give my friends a break and rent a car.  Jetblue is running this awesome deal through hertz, where if you rented a car for 5+ days you can earn 1,500 extra trueblue points.  Bonus!  It worked out, but the person @ HERTZ didn't apply the promotion code.

Sadly, i'm in the process of trying to get these points applied but I wanted to give you guys the heads up when booking at the rental counter to make sure to mention the promotional code so it will be applied correctly.

So a few years ago, like in 2007 or something, I had purchased a round trip ticket from Jet Blue from Long Beach, CA to JFK or LGA (I forgot which it was, but it was NY).  I was scheduled to return to Long Beach on Monday, leaving at 6am in the morning.  At around 11 pm at night, as I am sleeping, I get a phone call.  I finally decide to answer it but it's already gone to voicemail.  Turns out to be a recorded message saying ""due to weather conditions, your Jet Blue flight has been cancelled.  Please check jetblue.com to reschedule your flight"".  So I immediately log on to jetblue and discover that ALL the flights to Long Beach are booked until WEDNESDAY.  So i call them and beg them to get me on a flight because I have to get to work on Monday.  Sorry, they say, we are booked until Wednesday.  What's that?  Oh, sorry we don't partner with other airlines so we can't get you on another flight with anyone else.  What's that? Oh, I'm really sorry, I know it's not raining but it might be tomorrow morning.  What's that?  Oh, don't worry, we will refund you the unused portion of your ticket. 

God I was pissed.  I had to go to Delta to get a flight out at 5pm and got back to Los Angeles at 11 pm and I paid $800, that was the CHEAPEST one way ticket they had for Monday.  Jet Blue refused to re-imburse me for it.  The worst part of it was that Delta is based out of LAX.  So after I got back, I had to hail a cab to drive me to Long Beach to pick up my car at Jet Blue.  They even refused to pay for that!  I was so mad I called them after fuming about it for a few days and they gave me a link and told me to fill out my complaint (or send an email to someone, I forgot, it was a while ago) so I did that and they sent me a $50 gift voucher for a future Jet Blue flight.  Sorry, that's the best we can do sir.  

It was the worst experience I ever had with an airline.",1344585162.0

Reddit Underground Railroad for JetBlue Travelers (Crosspost from /r/AskReddit),10,d3epe,reddittraveljetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/d3epe/reddit_underground_railroad_for_jetblue_travelers/,6,"We once had an Underground Railroad to free our brothers and sisters from the unjust society and culture imposed upon them. A rough network of collaborators helped to make this happen. The conductors of this railroad risked their livelihood and, most likely, their lives to look beyond societal norms of the day and set out to inform and rescue those who needed it most. The unnamed stations that served to hide those who desired freedom. 

We now have a chance once again to rescue those who yearns for freedom from the daily doldrum of modern living. For the lifers who wake up early in the morning before sunrise and look out to the night for some sign of inspiration that never seems to come. For those who zombies through the daily grind of life, whether it be coursework or corporate, hoping to be reanimated at the end of the day only to be pitched back to the brainless life once the alarm goes off the next day. For they who grasped at their final chance to experience a nomadic life that comes once in a lifetime...or in this case, for the past 2 years. 

I propose we make a _Reddit Crosscountry Highway_ for those who have taken the the JetBlue Challenge and is using it to live life simply on the road. To allow those who want to escape or just to enjoy a new way of living for this brief period.

**For Travelers:**

* *Meeting stations:* Suggest an airport hub or prominent city location to act as a meeting spot for those who desire to travel with another redditor for one leg of the journey and/or beyond
* *Waypoints/Points of Interests:* Suggest a point of interest or event you know coming up that other people taking the journey might enjoy
* *People of interest*: Introduce people you've met on your journey that doesn't use Reddit/don't know about this Highway to those that come to the city after you. (This might need to be done exclusively through PMs as a protection barrier)

**For those not on the journey but inclined to help the travelers:**

* *Agents* to act as guides, willing to show those who visit around their city or even just to offer suggestions on where to go
* *Rest stations* for those who are weary at the end of day: A generous redditor willing to offer up their residence to those who are traveling for the night


Suggestions needed and are quite welcomed.

There is no set date for this because I have friends I can stay with in Chicago, so if you cannot make the drive until the weekend that is fine.  

I just want to know if this is a viable option before I book my flight.  Which means I have to know in the next few days.  

As it stands now I am going back to Tampa to visit friends, sit on the beach, and wait for a hurricane after departing Seattle.  Then it is either back to Ohio via Pittsburgh or to the Creation Museum.

I'm hosting a couple redditors for the next couple days.  My understanding is they're pretty well busy tomorrow with Warner Brothers, but Thursday is still pretty open.  I started a discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/9p9nn/los_angeles_cuz_weve_got_guests/) but I figured since [this *has* been discussed](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/9lol0/long_beach_meetups_930_and_101_post_ideas_here/) in the semi-recent past, a little reiteration wouldn't hurt.

I'm between shows so I can ferry the guys around.  However, I've spent the past two years half-living in The Valley (and half living in Seattle) so I'm not as culturally literate as I like to be.  

Home base is Playa Del Rey.  Westside is good.  I hear [Dockweiler Beach](http://beaches.co.la.ca.us/bandH/Beaches/Dockweiler.htm) is a good place to set fire to things (mostly we've just use it to have our asses kicked by deceptively high amounts of surf).  My wife is hot.  That is all.

**Edit:**  I'm going to do my level best to avail our guests of obizuth's kind offer; my reasons aren't entirely selfless but c'mon - is that not totally awesome?  Meetup is assured, the only question is where; Museum of Jurassic Technology will depend on obizuth's schedule but I'll keep this space updated.

The idea is to send two bobbleheads around the world, redditor to redditor, for as long as we possibly could, and document their journeys and adventures wherever they go.

However, we seem to have hit two major speed bumps right now, and the project is in desperate need of some assistance and initiative to get back on track again!

First of all, you might have read the [unfortunate news](http://blog.reddit.com/2009/09/well-were-officially-on-day-4-of-grand.html) with one of the bobbleheads, which was supposed to travel by hand-over between redditors. This might be easily fixed with either some glue, or perhaps if someone could arrange a new bobblehead to take its place? If it was possible at all, that would be great. Anyone got any ideas?

In either case, the thing I'd really like some help with, if there's any way at all to do it, is to get the first bobblehead back on track again!

It has gone from Sweden, to Texas, to Washington DC, and is now in the hands of [CarrierDriver](http://www.reddit.com/user/CarrierDriver), where it has been for over a month, and I'm starting to become really worried that it will be the end of the road for this project if he don't ship it soon! :(

There is at least 62 people in line that would be very happy if there was something that could be done to speed up the process a bit, and after having seen the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0rBxsTZ5U4) of how effectively you managed to help P-Dub make his long overdue homework, I just thought that maybe there's a chance you could track down CarrierDriver and help him send the bobblehead to the next eagerly awaiting redditor?

(My main concern is the little notebook that goes along with it, with a bunch of stuff written in it, that can't be replaced as easily as the bobblehead itself, unfortunately.)

When this project started, I just hoped that this wouldn't happen, but I guess Murphy's Law just can't be ignored. I can't really think of something other to do than to ask for help from other fellow redditors and see if it's possible to speed things up, other than sending a ""Hey, what's the status?"" PM every other day.

I mean, I start feeling like the boss in Office Space, leaving messages on the answering machine. ""Yeah, if you could just go ahead and ship the bobblehead tomorrow, that would be greaaat. Mkay?"". Darn it, I don't want to be Lumbergh! XD

Tips and Things to Notice Flying JetBlue,12,9h0ro,reddittraveljetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/9h0ro/tips_and_things_to_notice_flying_jetblue/,10,"I just flew JetBlue to Portland and back (to DC) last weekend, so here are some tips for easy flying!

* They have a handy menu of their drinks and snacks in the seat-back pockets.  On some flights they also read out the list.  I recommend the Doritos Munchies Mix.  
* The seats are comfy!  (leather-like, not hard at all, lots of give)
* Don't expect to borrow a blanket or pillow for free.  You have to buy them for $7.  And if the plane's not full, it will be cold!
* They have cable TV and satellite radio, unlike other airlines with movie selections.  Don't forget your earphones; theirs cost $2.
* You can watch a sneak preview of a tv pilot if you want (at least you could last week).  Called something like ""Modern Family.""  Up to you guys, but I tried a few minutes and found it to be god-awful.

Some things I'd be curious to keep track of:

* How many pilots crack jokes?  (mine were 1 of 4; on my last flight the Pilot said, ""We have two of our best Flight Attendants with us today.  And we have Stephanie.""  That put a big grin on her face as she repeated for people in the next 10 minutes that yes, she was Stephanie.)   
* How much of the time do they use their little map-channel where you get to follow where the plane is?  (3 of 4 on mine)  
* How often were flights delayed?  (none of mine in any way)  
* How often did flights land early? (I think 2 of mine did.  Between 10 and 30 min early)",1252029660.0

Originally I had the idea that if you guys came through LA, I'd be happy to show you around the Warner Bros lot where I work (great photo ops, etc). After a little more thought, I realized that there are a lot of ways that I can get the studio officially (or semi-officially) involved.

Ideally these would be special requests in that they're ones we hope you'd try to see through and we'd be willing to facilitate to completion.

Naturally the community comes first and the resources available to you will be available to you regardless of whether or not you accept these missions, however, I wanted to include these people for their exceeding generosity.

I set the cut off at $50+ as that limited the number to around 10. This way, it's possible to include as many people as possible without intruding too much on the general community planning. The organizers will have to moderate these requests such that they fit in the travel schedule and don't exceedingly tax either the time or effort of you guys.

We might have to limit these requests even further as the reddit community has been coming up with great ideas on their own and there are other great missions in the works, but I felt it necessary that these people be rewarded, if in nothing else, recognition.

If you've donated the qualifying amount you should have received an e-mail message from me. If you've changed your donation amount, or donated recently, you'll have to contact me individually and confirm.

Anyway I'm opening this up to suggestions for how we should handle the voting. I'm going to draw up a quick spreadsheet and take my lunch hour to call all the applicants and hopefully their references. If you haven't received a questionnaire for me yet you probably sent me an email after I'd gone to bed last night and you'll get the questions in a moment.

Yeah, it's a pain, but we're giving you a month-long trip of awesome for it. If you're worried about me using your personal information for evil rather than good, you can ask Redditor Lycurgus to confirm that I'm real and sane.

I currently live at home with my parents (hooray...) while semi-searching for employment.  I am easy going, I love to travel, and I love to explore.

My qualifications:

* I have $50 to my name, so I will be forced to comply with any requests made by donors in order to fund necessary expenses on my trip, like food (outside of the generous donation we have received in the form of a BACON sponsorship) and alcohol.

* I love to travel and do not mind spending time on planes - multiple locations in one day or crazy missions across the US in limited time frames are no problem!

* I come equipped with my own netbook for documentation purposes

* I have a passport and would love to make this trip international

* I will sleep anywhere: floors, couches, beds, huddled in doorways, in airports, etc...  Any friendly redditor would be able to put me up for the night, or as was one previous suggestion, I could travel for the month and never leave the airports (I cannot yet support this option unless something interesting to do is introduced, but if chosen to do it, I will).

(1) experience.  when i was a teenager, i backpacked around europe for two months.  you're thinking, ""give someone else the opportunity.""  here's the thing: if the person isn't used to being isolated for a long time, there's an excellent chance they'll crack up and go home early.  i won't.

(2) if you pick me, i'd write every day.  if you host me, i'll write about you.

(3) before i studied writing, i studied photography.  also, i'm learning how to edit video.  so i'd turn the whole trip into a multimedia project.

(4) because i really want to go to grad school next year and this would be the highlight of my application.  i don't know if that's good or bad.  i think if i do it well, then it's good.

i just graduated from the new school in nyc with a concentration in nonfiction creative writing.  i'm 29, male, and unemployed.  i have a passport and i'm a very polite houseguest.

i filled out saydrah's questionnaire last night and i was hoping my responses would be published in the final voting, but now with the deadline in a few hours, i know that won't happen.  so here's just some additional notes.

a) i can deal with the strain and loneliness of traveling alone, and i won't flake out or have a meltdown and go home.  this is rewarding, not easy, and i understand that.

b) before writing, i was studying photography, and i have a sense of composition.  my pictures won't be ten feet away with harsh glare and shadowy faces.

c) i'm biased, but i think writing is the most essential form for this project.  i just finished college with a concentration in creative nonfiction.  for someone like me, this is the project you dream of when you walk out of your last class.  there are lots of jobs for nonfiction writing, but not necessarily creative nonfiction.  most universities that offer a masters degree in creative writing don't offer nonfiction, only fiction or poetry.  with a project like this, i can incorporate travel essay, personal profiles, cultural research, historical research, humor, and i can do it all lyrically and bring it to a literate audience.  i think i can make something worthwhile for the reddit community.

d) if you approve a task for me to do, i'll do it.  ""whatever you say"" is the least i can do.

Notes From the Underground

Director/Producer

Took a 9,980 mile road trip around the rim of the United States to conduct interviews for a documentary film about the history of the independent music movement. Had one partner and about $2,700 for the 31 day trip.

Film is currently 1/8th complete.

Release date September 9th 2013.

Also have lived in the Hollywood Hills, witnessed a stabbing in South Ozone Park, gotten cruised in Central Park (did not accept, ha), been hypnotized by street hustlers, nearly killed numerous times, taught Andre 3000 just how famous he really is, been raised by evangelicals, slept in fields, caves, backyards, co-founded the largest non-drinking related club at ASU, aspire to do justice to a DBZ live action film, drove 2,400 miles roundtrip to spend 4 hours in New York, organized an unlicensed boxing match, stole Jerry Bruckheimer's seat at his premiere, lived off 10 dollars a week, had a nice conversation with Paul Schrader, hung with human traffickers in Mexico, evaded police capture (multiples),  and been featured in various newspapers for both significant constructive and destructive actions.

I have also worked as a video store employee, ranch hand, mortgage broker, ice cream store manager, hosptice delivery driver, file clerk, secret shopper, and professional filmmaker. 


What I have to offer is that I can be put into harms way and not only volunteer to do so but be reasonably comfortable in the process. If you want to see what skid row is like at 3am through nightshot, I can do that. Bangkok betting parlors, done. Tokyo motorcycle gangs, African civil wars, South American holy men, a trip down to Mcmurdo, or hunting killer squid of the coast of wherever that would be possible, im down.

When I was a kid (6-8) I wanted to grow up to be either a samurai, a ninja, a spy, or a stockbroker.

Current heros: Werner Herzog, Hunter S. Thompson, Lars von Trier, Sam Houser, and Steven Soderbergh.

Never bored and usually unemployed.

I do have a job but it only brings in $350/month but I have rent and bills to pay so that leaves me with nothing.  I am going to move in with my folks shortly to save up money.  I moved out too early and with that I was not ready financially and having to give things up for a year.  I would most likely lose my job if I am chosen but I don't care.  This trip would most likely give me a great boost in motivation to start online endeavors.  In return completing two goals in one.  Traveling the World and making income from online.

I own a couple of websites and would love to make a reddit video blog and update it everyday and every time something interesting happens.  You can view my video making/editing and acting skills here http://www.youtube.com/user/jeesumcrowdotcom
I would also set up social networking things as well to keep people updated and spread the reddit word.  If any redditers take me in which would be awesome!

I believe that doing this will open my eyes to many things and would make me a better person.

I want to be your traveling redditor!,1,9bm71,reddittraveljetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/9bm71/i_want_to_be_your_traveling_redditor/,0,"Ok, so I'm 22 and male, living in the southwest US. I got laid off by Circuit City on Dec 22, 2008 and have been completely unable to find a job anywhere. My specialties are photography, cooking, computer repair, and psychology (yeah, weird combination). I could be a photo/food journalist, just for you!

I have no loved ones to keep me from doing stupid things for my beloved internet community, and I love traveling. I have a decent DSLR I got on the cheap before leaving CC and a 1.5yr old laptop with a couple good batteries, and a cell phone for data connection wherever. I have nothing keeping me here except a cellphone bill and credit card payments, and have literally no money to my name. 

I love traveling, and taking pictures, and I'd love to add something epic to reddit!

Any questions? let me know!

I just got back to the States and am currently living in Brooklyn, NY.  I haven't done many touristy things in the States and I'd like to see what my own country has to offer.  I spent a lot of time in Europe couchsurfing and I think it would be really interesting to meet some fellow redditors in a similar vain of hospitality.  Oh, and once school starts at the end of this month I will only have class on Tuesdays and Wednesdays so I could make lots of 5-day trips in between.  Please?",1250597396.0

I am the best candidate.,0,9bmef,reddittraveljetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/9bmef/i_am_the_best_candidate/,0,"I'm sure you don't believe me. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't believe me. But it's true, and I'm going to tell you why. I am 26 years old, a guy, and I live in Arizona. To continue...

1) I am a bacon chef. 

2) I am a science fiction writer currently suffering from a writer's block.

3) I am an avid drinker, and am fun to be around. I never pass out and I never cockblock.

4) I have a camera, and I'm not afraid to use it.

5) I know over 9000 memes and promise to use them only under the most dire of circumstances.

6) I'm attractive and I can do cartwheels. But I'm a man, so you'll still be able to relate to me.

7) I live in a small town in Arizona and if I don't get the fuck out of here, I'm going to die.

8) I am quite fastidious and will not clog your toilet if I stay at your house. Also, I use words like ""fastidious.""

9) I think sleeping is for suckers, so you'll get the most bang for your buck out of me.

10) I am capable of composing a blog or website of the adventure that will be engaging and fun, and will promote the greatness of JetBlue and Reddit and bacon.

11) I have the perfect backpack for this. 

12) I will do whatever is asked of me, provided it won't injure or kill me. I've eaten chicken feet and had my cock pierced and I doesn't afraid of anything.

13) I have a fantastic username. 

14) I want to visit the Creation Museum! You know you want a picture of me riding the saddled dinosaur while wearing a Reddit shirt.

15) I will bring trinkets to geocache at every location I visit. Maybe Soapier can help with this. ;)

16) I'll go to New Jersey.

17) I am not a serial killer, thief, or rogue of any sort.

18) I will bring a travelling ""thing"" with me, which will be photographed in every place I visit and with every person who wishes to be in a picture with it. I'm open to suggestions.

19) I've got nothing keeping me here! I could leave today! Let's go!

20) DIGG SUCKS

I will tell bedtime stories to the Narwhals about a fantasy place called Reddit...,0,9bod3,reddittraveljetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/9bod3/i_will_tell_bedtime_stories_to_the_narwhals_about/,0,"I am 27 and tho I've only dreamed of traveling the world, I am globally networked!!!  I have friends in or friends who have family in the following countries: 

Kosovo

Jordan

Israel

India

Congo

Nigeria

Turkey

Japan

Cambodia (tho not sure if her family there is close to her)

Kenya

Germany

France

Greece

Egypt

England

Jamaica

Afghanistan

Panama

Ecuador

as well as Hawaii & Alaska.  

I also have friends who work for international organizations who can probably hook me up to many other places (Iran is near the top of my wishlist) as far as people to meet me if not offer a place to stay too.  I also speak some French (I've been out of the US twice, once on a cruise and once for a week in Paris.  Oh yeah and Canada).

[This is me](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3579/3833310198_a6a928b052.jpg) - yep, a female redditor!  

I live near my hometown in Maryland just outside of DC, which is an exciting, yet expensive place to live, so I've spent most of my 3 years out of college working as a secretary in a law firm, although I keep saying I'm going to quit to make videos for Current TV.  I'm hardly ever home, I keep myself pretty busy with things like leadership training, buddhism, and going on adventures when I can!

A little more about me:

I majored in politics with a minor in history and have a passion for peace and justice.  

I'm a former role-playing/video-game addict, I love cartoons/anime. 

My love of bacon is making my first attempt to give up pork/beef/lamb sooooooo difficult!

I was raised atheist/agnostic/unitarian (roughly all the same thing)

I actually miss being Rick-Rolled

I still have hope for Obama.  :D
