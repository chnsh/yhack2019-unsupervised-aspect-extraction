jetblue,"I belive (dont quote me on this) that there are 4 parts to the exam. A math and general knowledge portion (eg. I think one of the ""harder"" questions is something like (y-12)*4=16), a how yould you react section (if 2 customers got in a fight, would you a,b,c,d...), a personality section (how well do you work with others, etc...). One of the tests is apperently mock simulator where you have to use the arrow keys on the keyboard to fly a plane to some rings while paying attention and keeping track of what people are telling you, how many times you hear a buzzer, how many planes you see, where you see the airport is, etc. Like I said this is just stuff I saw online but I'm sure if you just do some basic review of the fundamentals you should be fine.

Based on the laws and statutes of the European Union, one can work and live in the European Union if they are nationals of countries that have an agreement with the EU to work there with a work permit. No restrictions. There are more than 79 such countries.

 [https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/work-permits/index\_en.htm](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/work-permits/index_en.htm) 

If a person has dual citizenship of the United States and of one of those countries, they can work and live in the EU. If a person is a permanent resident of the U.S. and is a national of one of those 79 countries, they also can work and live in the European Union. They would have to file for a re-entry permit before leaving the U.S., which allows them to stay outside the U.S. for up to 2 years continuously without losing permanent residency. Or they can just fly back to the U.S stay a couple of days then fly back to Europe. 

So 'technically' Americans are eligible for the program.",1564866173.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/ci891a/jetblue_gateway_select_program_questionsdiscussion/,1,1,0,t3_bfh933

jetblue,"Our original flight out of JFK last Saturday evening was canceled 24 hours in advance. I know there was supposed to be a big storm, but I don’t understand why JetBlue cancels flights so easily. For some context, there were about 150 flight cancelations last Saturday, 138 of those flights were JetBlue. Delta didn’t cancel a single flight and AA canceled one. They offered us seats on a flight from LGA to Boston. We had a four hour layover in Boston before our flight from Boston to SLC. We boarded the flight from Boston to SLC without incident, the sat on the tarmac for nearly two hours.  I think we finally took off with about two minutes left in our de-icing window. (My understanding is you have to be de-iced again if you stay at the airport for longer than 60 minutes after being de-iced). We finally got to SLC around 1:00 AM.   12 hours for a flight that should have taken 4.5 hours.  

On the return flight SLC to JFK, we were an hour late getting out.

This isn’t the first time I’ve been burned by JetBlue. They once stranded me in NYC and refused any kind of compensation because they claimed the flight was canceled due to weather. When I pointed out that every other JetBlue flight was leaving on time, I was told our particular aircraft was smaller and couldn’t fly in bad weather. When I pointed out that the planes that were leaving were the exact same make and model as our plane, I was basically told to shut up and sit down. We finally got another JetBlue employee to admit our flight had only 20 or so booked passengers and they used the weather as an excuse to cancel a flight that would have resulted in them losing money.

If you do decide to transport the dog, consider helping it reposition mid flight.

Also, are you sure you have the max size carrier? The duffel sized carrier we had was capable of housing a dog larger than 15 pounds.

This delta bag in medium is rated for dogs up to 16 pounds. And while above the size limit, it should not be an issue if you dont make it one.

Call Jetblue on Thursday night and see what they say. They may or may not have any useful info ~24hrs before hand. Expect to get to the airport at your scheduled check-in time, and expect to spend a long time in the terminal waiting.

jetblue,"JetBlue point prices track the cash prices at a rate of (very close to) 1.4 cents per point, eg a $500 cash ticket will be priced at about ~35,700 points. If the cash price goes up or down, the points price will go up or down to keep that same ratio.

September is so far away right now, the price they're offering is probably their rock bottom, and it's unlikely to move at all for a few months - but when it does, it's virtually guaranteed to move up, not down. Prices really only drift down after they've already skyrocketed upwards in the few weeks before a flight.

This is _especially_ true if you're flying JFK<->SFO or BOS<->SFO, which are two of the most competitive routes in the country. As a result, airlines compete _very_ closely on price and the inventory is managed so carefully that there tends to be very little price fluctuation at all. JetBlue (and all the others) know that if they ratchet up the price on this route, other airlines will be perfectly happy to sell you the ticket at the current low rate instead. So buy the ticket, cross it off your list, and move on to worrying about other things.

btw, Sept 2 is also the Sunday before labor day, which means prices may be a good bit higher this weekend than others. That's not going to change unless they suddenly reschedule the holiday, though, so waiting to buy this ticket won't save you any money.

jetblue,"Yeah, JetBlue will always be a point to point and it's drastically different than how legacies run their operation. This is not saying there aren't *any* connecting flights. It just minimizes it.

 Really how it works is they setup shop with a 'focus city' and then just spin off a ton of destinations from that city and that's it. Point to point. Instead of routing you through hubs to get you to where you need to go. But to keep the network strong there are connections between the focus cities because one might have a destination you need to get to. There's pros and cons. The biggest con being that JetBlue can't afford to fly everywhere and anywhere like a large carrier. Yet, even on jetblue there's example of  connecting flights. For example if you live in NY and want to get to Dallas on Jetblue the only way to do so is to go from JFK to BOS then from BOS to DFW.

JetBlue does work like any other airline. So if you book a connecting flight (under one PNR number) and you checked bags you can always expect that it will be moved over to  the other jetblue flight. If you booked two flights for the same day and it's not under the same PNR I would expect you'd have to recheck.

Here's some people that mentioned it going far back as 2008:

The average flight (as of 2015) in the US was around $380, so running a similar itinerary to the last time would likely be somewhere north of $4,000, not excluding expenses for the traveler (I'm pretty sure I kicked in around $1,000 of my own money over the month for random food, drink, lodging and transportation expenses). 

If someone wanted to actually put in the effort to generate the interest to kick it off, I'd be a supporter, but the fact that fact that over the years since this happened the last time, it's never gotten any further than people asking if we should try again indicates to me that nobody actually wants to be bothered with coordinating the thing.
