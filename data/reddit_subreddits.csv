12 Hour Delay,3,dj3cnd,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/dj3cnd/12_hour_delay/,2,"First time posting, On Mobile. Hope this is the right place to post, sorry for formatting, spelling, grammar, etc. 

So I'm currently sitting in the Denver Airport, settling in to spend the night here until 10 am. 

My flight was suppose to leave at 11:59 pm on Oct 16. But instead a pilot called in sick, apparently only an hour before the flight was suppose to leave and without the second pilot we are unable to leave. 

From my understanding, they attempted to find another pilot but we're unable so now they have to fly in a new crew in the morning. 

So instead of meeting my connecting flight at 6am. I now leave here at 11 am, reach the connecting airport at 430 pm and then get on my new connecting flight at 1030 pm to reach my destination 13 hours later then I originally was suppose too. 

I picked JetBlue because I've previously had no issues with them, in fact my next flight in Nov is booked with them. Something which I regret and I'm almost thinking of cancelling and rebooking with any other airline. 

And tbh, I'm not entirely angry because of the delay. It's frustrating and annoying but what really gets me, is the refusal to get people a place to stay. This isn't a 3 hour delay or even a delay during the day where people have access to transportation, food, etc. It's 2 am and most of us don't live here. We have no place to stay. 

But Hey, at least I got a meal voucher for $8 that doesn't work at McDonald. That I can't use until the restaurants open in like 6 hrs. So ill starve instead.  /s

Update: spent the night at the airport and got my flight in the morning. But now my connecting flight was canceled. And I'm stuck.",1571329358.0

Jetblue #1954 SJU to FLL WTF!!!! Delay,2,cckdvc,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/cckdvc/jetblue_1954_sju_to_fll_wtf_delay/,0,"Flight was scheduled to depart at 9:20pm and the plane arrived from a previous destination on time. No alerts of any delays. Jetblue starts boarding, as usual, but now (at the time the post started) it is 10:56pm with everyone on board and the plane’s doors are still open. “Missing paperwork” they are saying. No water for passengers now for almost two hours. 

Why would you board ppl if you are not ready to leave!!!!!!!!!  It’s starting to get uncomfortable.  And there is no communication to the passengers from the crew other than “missing paperwork”.   I (who is not on the plane) knows of the departure time change before my family member on board. 

They are even saying that you can onboard but only to grab another flight. WTF!!!!!  Ppl from jetblue. Get you shit together and communicate with those passengers. Is now 11:00 and those doors are open!!!

Update 11:15pm:  Door is still open and now they will begin with the service of drinks and snacks (no alcohol, geez). 

And they said that because they started the service, the plane cannot leave the gate until the full service is completed and put away safely. 

Or you might say, buying time.

Update 11:33pm: Still at the gate. But crew just informed the passengers “Our supplies are extremely limited”. More than two hours at a gate you would expect that there is plenty of time to restock. Doors till open.

Update 11:45pm:  Snack and drink service is complete and safely put away. Doors are still open.  Crew is acting all busy asking passengers to close the tables and bring their back of the seat to a straight position like they are ready to depart but doors are still open. ALMOST THREE HOURS ON THE PLANE IN A GATE!!!!!  No maintenance issues, no weather delays.   Just pure irresponsibility and a bad performance by Jetblue.

Jetblue vacations - corporate discounts? Any corporate employees?,2,9tk6iu,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/9tk6iu/jetblue_vacations_corporate_discounts_any/,1,"Do Jetblue corporate employees get access to crazy vacation deals? My friend Kate has been booking vacations through an acquaintance Judy who's friend Charles works for Jetblue corporate. Charles sends Judy these insane vacation deals and Judy passes them on to her friends. When I say insane, I mean like 7 day, all inclusive Caribbean trips (to major resorts) for like $600 including flights and airport transfers. Judy requires cash for the trips, apparently sends the money to Charles who books the trips using his corporate card. The trip vouchers are good for 2 years and you can cancel a booked trip up to 30 days before for a full refund. The prices drop even more if 10+ tickets are purchased.

Something just doesn't seem right. It seems too good. Kate says Judy has be ""doing this for years"", has been a member of the community for 30 years and if she was scamming people, it would be known. I don't know anyone personally that has actually taken a trip but Kate has her first one coming up in November. I know 3 others taking trips in the next few months. Judy claims she doesn't get anything out of it, I would almost believe this more if she just admitted she gets a % cut. Kate asked if this was a timeshare thing and would need to sit through a presentation, Judy said no. Again, I would believe this more if that were the case. For this price, there has to be a catch.

Kate has purchased 4 vacations but my skepticism now has her nervous. If Judy were to get hit by a bus tomorrow, how would all these people reach Charles to book there trips or get refunds? How can Charles just book vacations for all these people? If you show interest in a trip, Judy jumps right on it and then you need to give her money immediately for this great deal. Something just doesn't smell right and I'm wondering if there are any current or former JB corporate employees out there that can vouch for getting amazing vacation deals that can be shared with friends.

"Double booked, only one charge...",2,98l59v,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/98l59v/double_booked_only_one_charge/,0,"So I was just trying to book a flight with JetBlue. I got to the lady screen, hit confirm, and got an error message. Tried a couple more times to no avail. Tried on the app, same deal. Finally I noticed that they are trying out a beta version of their booking app. It gave me the option to try the original site and I took it. Bingo, trip confirmed. 

Here's the interesting part: on my app, I had 4 confirmation numbers, all for the same trip. Naturally I call JetBlue right away. While I'm on hold, I check my credit card. Only one charge. Hmmm... I starry talking to the lady and give her the first confirmation number. She tells me that it seems the reservation was made, but nothing was charged, so she went ahead and cancelled it. I immediately said ""ok, thanks!"" and hung up. I check the app and it updates, removing 3 confirmation numbers, but a new one pops up! So I now have 2 flights, but charged only once.

Has this ever happened to anybody? What happens if I cancel the flight I paid for and keep the one that wasn't charged? Will it eventually get cancelled? Will I get charged at the desk? Should I just cancel the free one and be done with it? I'd like to hear your thoughts. Not from a morality stand point, thank you; I can make that decision myself and don't need the internet's thoughts on right and wrong. I'd like to hear if anybody knows how this will play out.

They haven’t located my bag so I had to fill out papers with information on my lost luggage. The second page asked for a list of items in my luggage and their receipts. They were all old clothing that I don’t have proof of purchase anymore or the memory of where I bought them. The only articles of clothing I have a receipt of were a air of pants and a sweater from Banana Republic that I had purchased before flying. The only other receipts I had were for my electronics which included a PS4 and a headset as well as three games. So I wrote those down. 

They call me today to tell me that they only compensate for essentials and not electronics so I explained that I have no other receipts and was told that I still had to write the items with the date of purchase and price. When I asked what I should do if I don’t know either of those things, the dude just repeated the thing instead of answering my question. 

They also said that they’d reimburse me for items that I needed to buy due to my lost luggage but only if I bought them within five days after the claim in made. I was way past the five day mark so I can’t even get reimbursement for the new clothing I had to buy. 

So all in all, I have nothing to show to get any reimbursement and I don’t know what to do. I’m a college student with a minimum wage job. I don’t have the money to replace all my lost items. And some were hand made. I don’t know what to do at this point.

This was a 7+ hour flight with no power outlets and no IFE.  At that point id had it with AA.

So for my fall SFO trip, I decided to give JetBlue a try.  However this meant giving up the direct flight and connecting through BOS.  Totally worth it because:

- The gate agents seem to actually care about their customers (Unlike the AA agents who seem to be more interested in their iPhones)

- The on board entertainment options are fantastic (and POWER OUTLETS!) 

- The flight attendants actually seem to care about their jobs (as evidenced by the ""service first"" attitude)

What is the most effective way to complain and/or request reimbursement for the aftermath of a cancelled flight?,2,6ergle,jetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/jetblue/comments/6ergle/what_is_the_most_effective_way_to_complain_andor/,0,"I encountered the worst air travel situation yet recently and that's after traveling a bit over the past several years.  I never before had issues with Jetblue, but this past trip was a vacation that almost tanked because of the travel and had me not wanting to ever use them again.  Each of the 4 flights I had going and coming was delayed if not once, several times, then the final returning leg, after being delayed multiple times, even while sitting on the airplane for an hour, was cancelled just before midnight with no other flights going out to my destination until late the next evening.  This forced me, my co-passengers and possibly passengers from what looked like another cancelled Jetblue flight to seek answers and alternatives for what to do at such a time of being stranded.  Many of us were not treated sufficiently and were not presented with acceptable options, which is ridiculous.  Many were families with small children, and by the time I got to a desk to speak to someone and ask questions of what was to happen and what available options were, we were told ""their"" hotels had sold out and the nearest would be an hour away and we would have to find one ourselves, but they would provide transportation.  There's much more to this, but long story short, I ended up staying at a nearby motel to keep costs low in the worst case of being totally rejected and not refunded or compensated for whatever reason, but I still find it reprehensible I was put in this position.  

I want to write a letter explaining this, but I don't want to send it to the wind or to some general or automated email address that will never read it.  Has anyone had success with complaints?

I just got back into town (BOS) from TPA.  When I was down there I figured for the first time ever, I would give my friends a break and rent a car.  Jetblue is running this awesome deal through hertz, where if you rented a car for 5+ days you can earn 1,500 extra trueblue points.  Bonus!  It worked out, but the person @ HERTZ didn't apply the promotion code.

Sadly, i'm in the process of trying to get these points applied but I wanted to give you guys the heads up when booking at the rental counter to make sure to mention the promotional code so it will be applied correctly.

So a few years ago, like in 2007 or something, I had purchased a round trip ticket from Jet Blue from Long Beach, CA to JFK or LGA (I forgot which it was, but it was NY).  I was scheduled to return to Long Beach on Monday, leaving at 6am in the morning.  At around 11 pm at night, as I am sleeping, I get a phone call.  I finally decide to answer it but it's already gone to voicemail.  Turns out to be a recorded message saying ""due to weather conditions, your Jet Blue flight has been cancelled.  Please check jetblue.com to reschedule your flight"".  So I immediately log on to jetblue and discover that ALL the flights to Long Beach are booked until WEDNESDAY.  So i call them and beg them to get me on a flight because I have to get to work on Monday.  Sorry, they say, we are booked until Wednesday.  What's that?  Oh, sorry we don't partner with other airlines so we can't get you on another flight with anyone else.  What's that? Oh, I'm really sorry, I know it's not raining but it might be tomorrow morning.  What's that?  Oh, don't worry, we will refund you the unused portion of your ticket. 

God I was pissed.  I had to go to Delta to get a flight out at 5pm and got back to Los Angeles at 11 pm and I paid $800, that was the CHEAPEST one way ticket they had for Monday.  Jet Blue refused to re-imburse me for it.  The worst part of it was that Delta is based out of LAX.  So after I got back, I had to hail a cab to drive me to Long Beach to pick up my car at Jet Blue.  They even refused to pay for that!  I was so mad I called them after fuming about it for a few days and they gave me a link and told me to fill out my complaint (or send an email to someone, I forgot, it was a while ago) so I did that and they sent me a $50 gift voucher for a future Jet Blue flight.  Sorry, that's the best we can do sir.  

It was the worst experience I ever had with an airline.",1344585162.0

Reddit Underground Railroad for JetBlue Travelers (Crosspost from /r/AskReddit),8,d3epe,reddittraveljetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/d3epe/reddit_underground_railroad_for_jetblue_travelers/,6,"We once had an Underground Railroad to free our brothers and sisters from the unjust society and culture imposed upon them. A rough network of collaborators helped to make this happen. The conductors of this railroad risked their livelihood and, most likely, their lives to look beyond societal norms of the day and set out to inform and rescue those who needed it most. The unnamed stations that served to hide those who desired freedom. 

We now have a chance once again to rescue those who yearns for freedom from the daily doldrum of modern living. For the lifers who wake up early in the morning before sunrise and look out to the night for some sign of inspiration that never seems to come. For those who zombies through the daily grind of life, whether it be coursework or corporate, hoping to be reanimated at the end of the day only to be pitched back to the brainless life once the alarm goes off the next day. For they who grasped at their final chance to experience a nomadic life that comes once in a lifetime...or in this case, for the past 2 years. 

I propose we make a _Reddit Crosscountry Highway_ for those who have taken the the JetBlue Challenge and is using it to live life simply on the road. To allow those who want to escape or just to enjoy a new way of living for this brief period.

**For Travelers:**

* *Meeting stations:* Suggest an airport hub or prominent city location to act as a meeting spot for those who desire to travel with another redditor for one leg of the journey and/or beyond
* *Waypoints/Points of Interests:* Suggest a point of interest or event you know coming up that other people taking the journey might enjoy
* *People of interest*: Introduce people you've met on your journey that doesn't use Reddit/don't know about this Highway to those that come to the city after you. (This might need to be done exclusively through PMs as a protection barrier)

**For those not on the journey but inclined to help the travelers:**

* *Agents* to act as guides, willing to show those who visit around their city or even just to offer suggestions on where to go
* *Rest stations* for those who are weary at the end of day: A generous redditor willing to offer up their residence to those who are traveling for the night


Suggestions needed and are quite welcomed.

There is no set date for this because I have friends I can stay with in Chicago, so if you cannot make the drive until the weekend that is fine.  

I just want to know if this is a viable option before I book my flight.  Which means I have to know in the next few days.  

As it stands now I am going back to Tampa to visit friends, sit on the beach, and wait for a hurricane after departing Seattle.  Then it is either back to Ohio via Pittsburgh or to the Creation Museum.

I'm hosting a couple redditors for the next couple days.  My understanding is they're pretty well busy tomorrow with Warner Brothers, but Thursday is still pretty open.  I started a discussion [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/comments/9p9nn/los_angeles_cuz_weve_got_guests/) but I figured since [this *has* been discussed](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/9lol0/long_beach_meetups_930_and_101_post_ideas_here/) in the semi-recent past, a little reiteration wouldn't hurt.

I'm between shows so I can ferry the guys around.  However, I've spent the past two years half-living in The Valley (and half living in Seattle) so I'm not as culturally literate as I like to be.  

Home base is Playa Del Rey.  Westside is good.  I hear [Dockweiler Beach](http://beaches.co.la.ca.us/bandH/Beaches/Dockweiler.htm) is a good place to set fire to things (mostly we've just use it to have our asses kicked by deceptively high amounts of surf).  My wife is hot.  That is all.

**Edit:**  I'm going to do my level best to avail our guests of obizuth's kind offer; my reasons aren't entirely selfless but c'mon - is that not totally awesome?  Meetup is assured, the only question is where; Museum of Jurassic Technology will depend on obizuth's schedule but I'll keep this space updated.

The idea is to send two bobbleheads around the world, redditor to redditor, for as long as we possibly could, and document their journeys and adventures wherever they go.

However, we seem to have hit two major speed bumps right now, and the project is in desperate need of some assistance and initiative to get back on track again!

First of all, you might have read the [unfortunate news](http://blog.reddit.com/2009/09/well-were-officially-on-day-4-of-grand.html) with one of the bobbleheads, which was supposed to travel by hand-over between redditors. This might be easily fixed with either some glue, or perhaps if someone could arrange a new bobblehead to take its place? If it was possible at all, that would be great. Anyone got any ideas?

In either case, the thing I'd really like some help with, if there's any way at all to do it, is to get the first bobblehead back on track again!

It has gone from Sweden, to Texas, to Washington DC, and is now in the hands of [CarrierDriver](http://www.reddit.com/user/CarrierDriver), where it has been for over a month, and I'm starting to become really worried that it will be the end of the road for this project if he don't ship it soon! :(

There is at least 62 people in line that would be very happy if there was something that could be done to speed up the process a bit, and after having seen the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0rBxsTZ5U4) of how effectively you managed to help P-Dub make his long overdue homework, I just thought that maybe there's a chance you could track down CarrierDriver and help him send the bobblehead to the next eagerly awaiting redditor?

(My main concern is the little notebook that goes along with it, with a bunch of stuff written in it, that can't be replaced as easily as the bobblehead itself, unfortunately.)

When this project started, I just hoped that this wouldn't happen, but I guess Murphy's Law just can't be ignored. I can't really think of something other to do than to ask for help from other fellow redditors and see if it's possible to speed things up, other than sending a ""Hey, what's the status?"" PM every other day.

I mean, I start feeling like the boss in Office Space, leaving messages on the answering machine. ""Yeah, if you could just go ahead and ship the bobblehead tomorrow, that would be greaaat. Mkay?"". Darn it, I don't want to be Lumbergh! XD

Tips and Things to Notice Flying JetBlue,11,9h0ro,reddittraveljetblue,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddittraveljetblue/comments/9h0ro/tips_and_things_to_notice_flying_jetblue/,10,"I just flew JetBlue to Portland and back (to DC) last weekend, so here are some tips for easy flying!

* They have a handy menu of their drinks and snacks in the seat-back pockets.  On some flights they also read out the list.  I recommend the Doritos Munchies Mix.  
* The seats are comfy!  (leather-like, not hard at all, lots of give)
* Don't expect to borrow a blanket or pillow for free.  You have to buy them for $7.  And if the plane's not full, it will be cold!
* They have cable TV and satellite radio, unlike other airlines with movie selections.  Don't forget your earphones; theirs cost $2.
* You can watch a sneak preview of a tv pilot if you want (at least you could last week).  Called something like ""Modern Family.""  Up to you guys, but I tried a few minutes and found it to be god-awful.

Some things I'd be curious to keep track of:

* How many pilots crack jokes?  (mine were 1 of 4; on my last flight the Pilot said, ""We have two of our best Flight Attendants with us today.  And we have Stephanie.""  That put a big grin on her face as she repeated for people in the next 10 minutes that yes, she was Stephanie.)   
* How much of the time do they use their little map-channel where you get to follow where the plane is?  (3 of 4 on mine)  
* How often were flights delayed?  (none of mine in any way)  
* How often did flights land early? (I think 2 of mine did.  Between 10 and 30 min early)",1252029660.0

Originally I had the idea that if you guys came through LA, I'd be happy to show you around the Warner Bros lot where I work (great photo ops, etc). After a little more thought, I realized that there are a lot of ways that I can get the studio officially (or semi-officially) involved.

Ideally these would be special requests in that they're ones we hope you'd try to see through and we'd be willing to facilitate to completion.

Naturally the community comes first and the resources available to you will be available to you regardless of whether or not you accept these missions, however, I wanted to include these people for their exceeding generosity.

I set the cut off at $50+ as that limited the number to around 10. This way, it's possible to include as many people as possible without intruding too much on the general community planning. The organizers will have to moderate these requests such that they fit in the travel schedule and don't exceedingly tax either the time or effort of you guys.

We might have to limit these requests even further as the reddit community has been coming up with great ideas on their own and there are other great missions in the works, but I felt it necessary that these people be rewarded, if in nothing else, recognition.

If you've donated the qualifying amount you should have received an e-mail message from me. If you've changed your donation amount, or donated recently, you'll have to contact me individually and confirm.

Yeah, it's a pain, but we're giving you a month-long trip of awesome for it. If you're worried about me using your personal information for evil rather than good, you can ask Redditor Lycurgus to confirm that I'm real and sane.

I currently live at home with my parents (hooray...) while semi-searching for employment.  I am easy going, I love to travel, and I love to explore.  Please allow me to be your surrogate traveller for the month, reddit!


My qualifications:

* I have $50 to my name, so I will be forced to comply with any requests made by donors in order to fund necessary expenses on my trip, like food (outside of the generous donation we have received in the form of a BACON sponsorship) and alcohol.

* I love to travel and do not mind spending time on planes - multiple locations in one day or crazy missions across the US in limited time frames are no problem!

* I come equipped with my own netbook for documentation purposes

* I have a passport and would love to make this trip international

* I will sleep anywhere: floors, couches, beds, huddled in doorways, in airports, etc...  Any friendly redditor would be able to put me up for the night, or as was one previous suggestion, I could travel for the month and never leave the airports (I cannot yet support this option unless something interesting to do is introduced, but if chosen to do it, I will).

(1) experience.  when i was a teenager, i backpacked around europe for two months.  you're thinking, ""give someone else the opportunity.""  here's the thing: if the person isn't used to being isolated for a long time, there's an excellent chance they'll crack up and go home early.  i won't.

(2) if you pick me, i'd write every day.  if you host me, i'll write about you.

(3) before i studied writing, i studied photography.  also, i'm learning how to edit video.  so i'd turn the whole trip into a multimedia project.

(4) because i really want to go to grad school next year and this would be the highlight of my application.  i don't know if that's good or bad.  i think if i do it well, then it's good.

i just graduated from the new school in nyc with a concentration in nonfiction creative writing.  i'm 29, male, and unemployed.  i have a passport and i'm a very polite houseguest.

i filled out saydrah's questionnaire last night and i was hoping my responses would be published in the final voting, but now with the deadline in a few hours, i know that won't happen.  so here's just some additional notes.

a) i can deal with the strain and loneliness of traveling alone, and i won't flake out or have a meltdown and go home.  this is rewarding, not easy, and i understand that.

b) before writing, i was studying photography, and i have a sense of composition.  my pictures won't be ten feet away with harsh glare and shadowy faces.

c) i'm biased, but i think writing is the most essential form for this project.  i just finished college with a concentration in creative nonfiction.  for someone like me, this is the project you dream of when you walk out of your last class.  there are lots of jobs for nonfiction writing, but not necessarily creative nonfiction.  most universities that offer a masters degree in creative writing don't offer nonfiction, only fiction or poetry.  with a project like this, i can incorporate travel essay, personal profiles, cultural research, historical research, humor, and i can do it all lyrically and bring it to a literate audience.  i think i can make something worthwhile for the reddit community.

d) if you approve a task for me to do, i'll do it.  ""whatever you say"" is the least i can do.

Notes From the Underground

Director/Producer

Took a 9,980 mile road trip around the rim of the United States to conduct interviews for a documentary film about the history of the independent music movement. Had one partner and about $2,700 for the 31 day trip.

Film is currently 1/8th complete.

Release date September 9th 2013.

Also have lived in the Hollywood Hills, witnessed a stabbing in South Ozone Park, gotten cruised in Central Park (did not accept, ha), been hypnotized by street hustlers, nearly killed numerous times, taught Andre 3000 just how famous he really is, been raised by evangelicals, slept in fields, caves, backyards, co-founded the largest non-drinking related club at ASU, aspire to do justice to a DBZ live action film, drove 2,400 miles roundtrip to spend 4 hours in New York, organized an unlicensed boxing match, stole Jerry Bruckheimer's seat at his premiere, lived off 10 dollars a week, had a nice conversation with Paul Schrader, hung with human traffickers in Mexico, evaded police capture (multiples),  and been featured in various newspapers for both significant constructive and destructive actions.

I have also worked as a video store employee, ranch hand, mortgage broker, ice cream store manager, hosptice delivery driver, file clerk, secret shopper, and professional filmmaker. 


What I have to offer is that I can be put into harms way and not only volunteer to do so but be reasonably comfortable in the process. If you want to see what skid row is like at 3am through nightshot, I can do that. Bangkok betting parlors, done. Tokyo motorcycle gangs, African civil wars, South American holy men, a trip down to Mcmurdo, or hunting killer squid of the coast of wherever that would be possible, im down.

When I was a kid (6-8) I wanted to grow up to be either a samurai, a ninja, a spy, or a stockbroker.

Current heros: Werner Herzog, Hunter S. Thompson, Lars von Trier, Sam Houser, and Steven Soderbergh.

Never bored and usually unemployed.

I do have a job but it only brings in $350/month but I have rent and bills to pay so that leaves me with nothing.  I am going to move in with my folks shortly to save up money.  I moved out too early and with that I was not ready financially and having to give things up for a year.  I would most likely lose my job if I am chosen but I don't care.  This trip would most likely give me a great boost in motivation to start online endeavors.  In return completing two goals in one.  Traveling the World and making income from online.

I own a couple of websites and would love to make a reddit video blog and update it everyday and every time something interesting happens.  You can view my video making/editing and acting skills here http://www.youtube.com/user/jeesumcrowdotcom
I would also set up social networking things as well to keep people updated and spread the reddit word.  If any redditers take me in which would be awesome!

I believe that doing this will open my eyes to many things and would make me a better person.

1) I am a bacon chef. 

2) I am a science fiction writer currently suffering from a writer's block.

3) I am an avid drinker, and am fun to be around. I never pass out and I never cockblock.

4) I have a camera, and I'm not afraid to use it.

Ideas for Renewing Companion Pass Welcome,3,dm14ea,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/dm14ea/ideas_for_renewing_companion_pass_welcome/,18,"I have enjoyed the use of Companion Pass throughout 2018 and this year.  It will sadly expire at the end of the year.

I originally qualified for CP by opening a Southwest Premier card and a Southwest Business card, meeting the spending requirements of each to earn bonus points that put me at the necessary 110,000 points mark.

To date, I have racked up 70,000 points toward the current renewal goal of that point total.

I had hoped to open a new Southwest Plus card, which would provide 40,000 bonus points for meeting its spending requirement.  However, since I already have the Premier card, Chase will not proceed with opening this new card.

As you can imagine, with just a couple weeks left in the new year, where the CP point bank resets (points are kept, but stop counting as progress toward CP), and the higher total to reach in 2020 (125,000), I'm eager to explore any other angles to close the gap on points needed.

I learned from Chase that closing out my current Southwest cards is moot for now, as they would not issue ones for newly opened accounts until 24 months following when I had opened my originals, which would therefore not be able to occur until next March and May.

We considered having my wife open a new card in her name, but we were told that she could not associate my Rapid Rewards number to her card.

Any leads here for other avenues to try out would be beyond appreciated.  Thanks in advance!

For a data exploration project, I scraped data from [https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Departures.aspx](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ONTIME/Departures.aspx) which lists flights. I chose to focus on 4 airlines (Southwest, United, American, Delta) to look at taxi times (time from gate to runway).

The airports I chose to focus on were chosen semi-randomly but they are : SFO, SEA, PHX, BNA, STL, CMH, LGA, JFK, HNL, IAH.

Something interesting I found was that Southwest has an average taxi-time around 12.5 mins while United/American/Delta have taxi times around 17 mins on average. I don't understand why so I was hoping someone here perhaps had some insight into this.

I did consider that Southwest doesn't fly to JFK, HNL, and IAH but even if I remove those Southwest performs noticeably better.

I will be looking a terminal maps today but does Southwest just have gates closer to the runway usually or do they do something different than these other airlines?

1.	There are no fucking saving seats. The more you do this shit and debate it over MIDDLE SEATS, the longer we are here.
2.	I’m not body shaming people, but you know if you don’t fit in a single airline seat. Don’t book a single seat for you and your significant other, who also doesn’t fit in single seat, and then say “child on lap” when your child will not fit on your lap AND THEN PUT THEM IN A SEAT. THE FLIGHT IS SOLD OUT. YOUR CHILD IS NOW OCCUPYING SOMEONES SEAT.
3.	if you are too big to occupy a single airline seat and you try to hide a middle when they’ve already announced its a sold out flight, you are inconsiderate AF. 

Two business men walking up and down the aisle looking for their paid seats when a bunch of inconsiderate jerks try to prioritize their comfort over a plane full of people and a flight crew who now have to figure out where the extra seat is (your kid).

I am flying from the east coast to the west coast for a wedding, during which I am the best man. Needless to say, I cannot afford to be there with delays or having issues with baggage.

I have a few options with my layover stop (all 3 options require the change of planes):

1. BNA: 40 minutes
2. MDW: 45 minutes
3. ATL: 90 minutes

Obviously, I'd like to minimize the amount of time I spend at airports and layovers.

Also, if my 1st flight (it is an early morning flight) gets delayed by even a little bit, I'd be screwed.

If not possible, then I can see whether I can get by without bringing a checked bag. **Which airport would be better, BNA or MDW**?

I booked our flights on sale on the day the schedule came out this year. 

The plan was to leave Saturday night at 11 pm to fly home. This was going to be a final park day for us and we’ve booked dining reservations as such (didn’t have to leave for MCO until 8ish). 

I’ve now received my second cancellation/change email from SW regarding my flight home. Now, instead of leaving at 11 pm, they changed us to a 2:30 pm flight. This ends up wasting our entire day. I checked the flight schedule and there are no later flights as originally booked. 

I can’t change my Disney ticket because it was booked as part of a package. If we leave early, the ticket is wasted for that day. If we fly out the following Sunday, we have to pay for a night in a hotel. Hotels in Orlando are a minimum of $300-400 per night because it is just days before Christmas. 

I contacted SW and they said “well we can change you to a different flight” (none exist outside of changing the date) or “we can refund you the points to your account” - refunding the points does not help me in my search for a new flight. Now, because we are 3 months away, other airlines are charging $400/person for the same time as our original flight. For perspective, we only paid about the equivalent of $99 with our points for the original flight. 

Do I have any leg to stand on here? I asked for a flight voucher or additional points to my account to make up for the lost $ on my side, and they wouldn’t budge. This is real shit having booked everything so early.

I probably wouldn't buy the early bird pass, because if it's $25 a person both ways, like I read somewhere, it completely negates the price difference, and I'll just go with another airline that eliminates the chance of not sitting together. Both kids are older than 6, but get anxious on flights, and sitting together is a necessity. If there's a high likelihood we'll sit together I'll set alarms or whatever to make sure I check in right on time, if there's not I'll fly with someone else.

Funny Boarding Class Games,3,d290uk,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/d290uk/funny_boarding_class_games/,5,"I just joined the sub today and I love Southwest.

I have 2 that I would like to share that will get some good eye rolls I think:

&#x200B;

1. I don't mind the emergency exit aisle.  But it's not my first choice.  But one time two knuckleheads came on board last and it was the only row available.  They SLOWLY walked to it and SLOWLY sat down in the seats and the flight attendant following protocol asked ""Are you comfortable..."" rhetorically.  Naturally they both shouted ""NO!"" and as a single passenger I gave up my on an aisle to accommodate.  Again, no issues - I was just tired at the time and didn't feel like it.
2. Again, I try to shoot for an aisle since I am taller person.  Over six foot.  It was a full flight and I had two empties beside me.  This family in late boarding class B (or C) was getting on with an infant.  With Southwest policy they don't like to break them up so I am removed from my aisle seat and placed between two rather large people sandwiched in the middle seat.  Again, kind of sucks - but it also got me away from an infant that was going to miserable flying.  So for 2 hours I don't really mind.

"FAQ Friday - What are the rules regarding fragile, large, or high value carryon items that don't meet the standard size?",1,cr6rpe,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/cr6rpe/faq_friday_what_are_the_rules_regarding_fragile/,8,"This weeks topic covers some exceptions that Southwest may make regarding carryon items that would not normally meet the size restrictions, or do to their sensitive nature can't be smushed into a typical roller bag. These items are typically musical instruments such as guitars or violins, highly sensitive photography or video equipment, or perhaps a bride's wedding dress!

# FAQ Friday - What are the rules regarding fragile, large, or high value carryon items that don't meet the standard size?

There are genuinely good reasons to wanting to avoid checking items. Checked baggage goes for a rough ride. It is grabbed, moved, plopped, put on conveyer belts, sent through scanners, sometimes opened and rather unceremoniously searched by TSA (often not repacked in your careful way), stacked with other heavy baggage on top, sent for ride outside in the elements between the terminal and the airplane, and sometimes left exposed when baggage handlers have to drop everything and seek cover due to severe weather safety protocols. As much as we would like the handlers to treat each bag with loving care we would also like to actually take off on time and have our luggage arrive when we do. This is why manufacturers are always trying to design the perfect bag for travel.

&#x200B;

[While you are carrying that instrument on board, why not share your talent?](https://i.redd.it/pluycm9ohtg31.jpg)

Generally, Southwest is pretty generous and understanding when it comes to asking for special consideration for items that don't fit neatly into the term ""baggage."" They discuss each category on their website and offer more details on what to expect. [Click here and scroll down to the ""Can I bring these items?"" section.](https://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/baggage/index.html)

Some highlights from that link:

* We recommend that **Customers carry on all medications and assistive  devices** that can be transported in the cabin in accordance with Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) safety guidelines (*e.g.*, walkers,  canes, crutches, CPAP machines, breast pumps, etc.). When packed  separately from other personal items, **medication used to accommodate a  disability and assistive devices do not count toward a Customer’s  carryon or checked bag limit**.
* If you're traveling with an infant or small child, you should know that  **proper use of a Child Restraint System (CRS) enhances child safety on  aircraft**.  Although not recommended, **if your child is under the age of two and you  would prefer to hold him or her on your lap when traveling, you may do  so on Southwest Airlines without charge and we'll be glad to check your  CRS for use at your destination.** (So, keep in mind, even if the flight is not sold out and there is a possibility there could be an extra seat for your infant to use, you cannot bring your CRS on board without a paid ticket for the child.)
* **Media cameras are exempt from the sizing** box  restriction imposed on other carryon luggage, and, if carried onboard,  must be stowed in accordance with FAA safety regulations. If the camera  is to be secured in a seat, however, a ticket must be purchased for that  seat.
* If  your **musical instrument (including case or covering) exceeds the sizing  requirements for carryon** items (10""x16""x24""), **it can be carried onboard  if it will fit in an overhead bin** or under a seat onboard the aircraft  **and there is space available** when you board the aircraft for the  instrument.
* In the event you are traveling with a musical instrument that will not fit in an overhead bin or under a seat onboard, **you may purchase a seat for the instrument** and carry it in the cabin.

In addition, **Southwest has allowed the purchase of a seat for a wedding dress or other large costume/attire that could potentially be damaged even in an overhead bin** due to items shifting during travel and the mere fact Southwest cannot guarantee that other passenger's baggage will not be carrying items that could spill or damage your item. (Seriously, one time there were ANTS crawling everywhere over everything because some passenger managed to sneak a container of them through TSA and the ants escaped. Fun times.)

***Please note***, other than purchasing an extra seat to guarantee your oversized but fragile item will be safe on board, you are at the mercy of the first-come, first-served system of overhead storage space. Your best bet if you are not able to purchase a second seat (due to policy or budget) is to be one of the first in line at boarding. **That means purchasing EarlyBird Check-In or ideally, a Business Select fare (which guarantees an A 1-15 boarding position) is your best bet.**

# To summarize:

1. Call ahead and make sure there is a note in your reservation about your special carryon item request.
2. Arrive early at the airport to discuss your needs with the gate agents and/or flight attendants.
3. Make sure you are one of the first to board, to increase your chance at that precious overhead bin space.
4. Purchase an extra seat if your item warrants it and your budget can handle it.

In the end, if the item is truly valuable or irreplaceable and possibly fragile, I would re-think the baggage system altogether and look into shipping with a proper protective container and insurance.

Question on charging fare difference to change to an earlier flight,5,cm2bik,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/cm2bik/question_on_charging_fare_difference_to_change_to/,11,"Here's the scenario: At the airport, 3-4 hours before my scheduled Southwest flight. There's an earlier flight that leaves in about 60-70 minutes -- same day, same departure/destination, has open seats. I want to change to the earlier flight, but Southwest requires that I pay the difference in fares, which about an hour before takeoff is a roughly $300 difference. 

If I'm already booked on a later Southwest flight to the same destination, I argue it's in the airline's interest to waive the difference in fares and put me on the earlier flight. My reasons:  
\-- It's one less passenger potentially affected by any delays that happen later in the day, always a risk.  
\-- It frees up the seat on my original flight, which they now have more time to resell to an unbooked passenger.   
\-- It's just good customer service and really doesn't cost them anything. (Yes, you can argue there's a nominal man-hours cost for making the change; if so, a change fee would be reasonable.)

Thoughts? I'd really like to know what I'm missing. Maybe because of time of day the earlier flight is a more expensive seat (not sure that's the case in my scenario), but if so, why not have a system to put me on standby for the change if the seat doesn't sell?

FAQ Friday - What are Travel Funds and how do I use them?,10,cl3oxs,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/cl3oxs/faq_friday_what_are_travel_funds_and_how_do_i_use/,4,"This week's topic is about Travel Funds, which are a source of much confusion and misinformation. Hopefully after reading this post you will have a better understanding.

# FAQ Friday - What are Travel Funds and how do I use them?

Simply put - Travel Funds are a flight credit you get when dealing with non-refundable fares and forms of payment. This is non-exhaustive list of the ways you get get Travel Funds:

* When you cancel a reservation with a Wanna Get Away fare.
* When you exchange a reservation with a Wanna Get Away fare for another flight that is cheaper the the original, the difference in fare will be saved as a travel funds that can be applied to a future flight.
* When you cancel a reservation of any fare type that was paid for with a non-refundable payment type such as previous Travel Funds, Southwest LUV Vouchers, and Gift Cards.
* When you exchange a reservation of any fare type that was paid for with a non-refundable payment type such as previous Travel Funds, Southwest LUV Vouchers, and Gift Cards, for another flight that is cheaper the the original, the difference in fare will be saved as a travel funds that can be applied to a future flight.

&#x200B;

Your Travel Funds will be held for you under the flight confirmation number for the reservation that was modified in the ways above. You simply spend them by saving the confirmation number and applying it on the payment page with your name.

&#x200B;

[The clear disclaimer on the website when using Travel Funds to purchase a new ticket.](https://i.redd.it/46m6ht7x41e31.jpg)

# [Wanna Get Away Fare Rules](https://www.southwest.com/html/air/fare-information.html)

* Fares are **nonrefundable** but **may be applied toward future travel** on Southwest Airlines **for the originally ticketed passenger only**.
* **S**hould a passenger **fail to apply** the nonrefundable ticket toward the purchase of future **travel within the eligibility period**, the entire amount of the fare, which includes without limitation, all fees, taxes, and charges, **will be forfeited**.

# Southwest vs Other Airlines

I'd like to mention again that **Travel Funds** are particularly awesome at Southwest Airlines. Let's say you booked the following itinerary for Atlanta (ATL) to Los Angeles (LAX), on Sep 17:

* **Southwest Airlines** Wanna Get Away is **$168** non-stop (no extra fees, bags included)
* **American Airlines** Basic Economy is **$185** non-stop (extra fees for seat selection and checking bags)
* **JetBlue** ""Blue"" is **$181**, non-stop not available - so one stop (extra fees for checked bags)
* **Spirit** Standard Fare is **$110** for non-stop  (extra fees for seat selection, carry-on and checked baggage)
* **United** Basic Economy is **$176**, non-stop not available - so one stop (extra fees for seat selection, carry-on and checked bags)

What would happen if your plans had to be changed? You couldn't get off work, or you forgot there was a family wedding to attend that day? Just for whatever reason you are not going to be able to take this trip. *What happens to the money you just spent on that flight?*

* **Southwest** \- You have no cancel fees. You are given **full credit of the $168** fare to use 12 months from the day of the original booking.
* **American Airlines** \- You would pay a $200 cancel fee. You would receive nothing. Zip. Good day sir!
* **JetBlue** \- You would pay a $200 cancel fee. You would receive nothing. Zip. Good day sir!
* **Spirit** \- You would pay a $90 cancel fee. You would have only 60 days to re-use the $20 credit left over.
* **United** \- You would receive nothing, because even if the Basic Economy ticket was more than the $200 cancel fee, Basic Economy tickets are forever and ever gone when canceled. Good day sir!

# Things to know before you book with Travel Funds

* When booking a reservation online, unused tickets (travel funds) will always be applied first, regardless of the expiration date or the order in which a Customer enters them in the reservation. If travel funds are applied, **the new ticket will inherit the earliest expiration date** of any form of payment used for that Passenger.
* All travel booked with unused funds or a Southwest LUV Voucher **must be completed** by the **expiration date**.
* Travel funds from unused or canceled flight reservations have to be used by **the originally ticketed passenger** on those reservations.
* Not sure if you still have travel funds associated with a reservation? [There is a tool for that on Southwest.com!](https://www.southwest.com/flight/travel-funds-search.html)

# What is the expiration date based on? The date of the booking, not the date of the flight!

If you BOOKED your trip today, on Aug 2, to FLY your trip on Sept 17, and canceled, the expiration date is one year from **AUG 2**.

# This is the verbiage included with every email when you receive Travel Funds

>Your reservation has been canceled.  
>  
>We're sorry things didn't work out this time. We look forward to our next chance to welcome you onboard. If there are travel funds associated with this reservation, **please keep your confirmation number to apply funds towards a future reservation by the expiration date**.  
>  
>PASSENGER  My Name  
>  
>RAPID REWARDS # XXXXXXXXX  
>  
>TICKET # 526XXXXXXXXXX  
>  
>**EXPIRATION****^(1)**     **Month XX, 20XX**  
>  
>(^(1)**All travel involving funds from this Confirmation Number must be completed by the expiration date.**)  
>  
>Fare Rules: If you decide to make a change to your current itinerary it may result in a fare increase. In the case you're left with travel funds from this confirmation number, you're in luck! We're happy to let you use them towards a future flight for the individual named on the ticket, **as long as the new travel is completed by the expiration date**.

*Did you notice the disclaimer about the EXPIRATION DATE? Like, mentioned no less than FOUR TIMES?*

# Do you think you are being clever and can outwit Southwest?

The number one trick people try to do to extend the date of their travel funds is they book a new flight they have no intention of traveling, then cancel it again, thinking the 12 months is now from the date of that flight! Muahahahaha, I beat the system! Right? Right? Wait, where did my funds go...?

Please re-read the section on what the expiration date is based on. If you book new travel using old funds, the new travel now takes on the expiration date from the funds used to pay for it. You haven't done anything but wasted the time you should have been using to actually fly somewhere.

# But I really really couldn't fly by the expiration date - pretty please is there anything that can be done?? I don't want to lose my money!

Well, one - you DID agree to by a non-refundable ticket, right? There are Anytime and Business Select fares that are more flexible and fully refundable, but you took the risk on a cheaper fare. No one was holding a gun to your head to make you buy a non-refundable fare. But whatever, sometimes Southwest will work with you. Just call or write them. There are no guarantees, and there will most likely be a fee to extend them **if** they find they can help you.

FAQ Friday - How do I score a free drink on Southwest Airlines?,10,ci0nze,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/ci0nze/faq_friday_how_do_i_score_a_free_drink_on/,13,"This week's topic is for those who love a nice cocktail, beer or wine in the sky. And not have to shell out $6-7 to do it.

&#x200B;

**FAQ Friday - How do I score a free drink on Southwest Airlines?**

&#x200B;

[A free drink is the tastiest drink!](https://i.redd.it/yyxtfadgr2c31.jpg)

&#x200B;

Before we begin, [click here to see the current in-flight menu!](https://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/inflight-experience/menu.html)

&#x200B;

One reason you will NOT score a free drink: Because your flight was late, canceled, baggage complaints, you stubbed your toe on the podium, etc. Southwest's policy is not offer Drink Coupons as compensation. See [last week's FAQ Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/cf5naq/faq_friday_southwest_reaccommodation_procedures/) on what they will do for you in these circumstances.

&#x200B;

Here are four ways to score yourself a free drink!

&#x200B;

**Drink Coupons** \- Drink Coupon Books are automatically sent to every Rapid Rewards (RR) member after they have flown 10 one-way revenue flights (so a round trip counts as two). And by revenue, I mean you paid with Credit/Debit Card, Paypal, Gift Cards, LUV Vouchers, and Travel Funds. Points bookings are not considered revenue - you are essentially getting an award flight. If you think ""HEY wait a minute right there, buster, I've easily flown 10 one-way revenue flights whars my coupons WHAR?"" double check your preferences in your RR account online. It is possible you may have accidentally checked the box to opt out of receiving the coupons (put there for the teetotalers, those who don't want to be tempted, religious reasons, etc). Also, make sure your RR account has your current mailing address! If you feel you should have gotten your coupons and didn't for whatever reason, politely [email](https://www.southwest.com/contact-us/contact-us.html?clk=GFOOTER-CUSTOMER-CONTACT-US) Southwest through their website and there is a good chance they'll resend them.

&#x200B;

**Business Select Fares** \- Each Business Select fare includes one free drink coupon only good for the day of the flight. You simply show your boarding pass to the Flight Attendant to redeem the coupon. You can do this with the mobile boarding pass, too, but you might want to screenshot the coupon just in case your mobile device gives you trouble in the sky. Unfortunately, if they don't offer beverage service (such as due to turbulence) there is no rain check to use the coupon.

&#x200B;

**Free Drink Celebration Days** \- Several times a year, Southwest will offer a free drink day to anyone flying on that date! Saint Patrick's Day is a big one, but often there are others. It changes each year, so keep your eye out. The last one as of this writing was June 18, to celebrate Southwest's Birthday! The [menu on board](https://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/inflight-experience/menu.html) will let you know if there is a free drink day coming up soon, so be sure to take a look.

&#x200B;

**Just Because** \- Southwest does watch it's inventory, and does expect Flight Attendants to charge for drinks. But they also give their employees in any department full agency to WOW their customers at anytime. Sometimes, they like the shirt you are wearing. Sometimes, they know the whole flight was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and could use a drink! Sometimes, due to whatever reason they had to rush service and honestly decided they simply didn't have time to take payment for the drinks. *It's really awesome when it happens*, so don't ruin it by being an entitled jerk demanding free stuff because you feel you've been inconvenienced by a last minute gate change and by golly Southwest owes you! Then the whole free drink good feeling buzz goes down the toilet and you've ruined what makes Southwest people so amazing.

I waited probably 2 minutes as we were one of the last ones on board before having to go ask where we sit then, because there weren’t any obvious seats. My wife and I ended up rows apart.

FAQ Friday - Southwest Reaccommodation Procedures - What happens if my flight is canceled or delayed?,6,cf5naq,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/cf5naq/faq_friday_southwest_reaccommodation_procedures/,2,"Welcome to this week's FAQ Friday!

&#x200B;

**Southwest Reaccommodation Procedures - What happens if my flight is canceled or delayed?**

&#x200B;

It is a very distressing experience. Often, when we travel, our flight date and time isn't just a whim - it's a carefully chosen part of a larger schedule for travel. A business meeting, family gathering, ground travel, hotel reservations, and purchases of excursions or tickets for events are all interconnected. When your flight travel is interrupted, it can often cause a domino effect of issues. A wrench in your carefully laid plans that was supposed to work like a well-oiled machine. It's no wonder that we get very anxious about how far Southwest will go to help passengers in these situations.

&#x200B;

First it is important to note, direct from **Transportation.gov**: [Contrary to popular  belief, for domestic itineraries airlines are **not required** to compensate  passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled.](https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights)

&#x200B;

In addition, **no airline guarantees their schedules**. You should always have in the back of your mind what you would do if your flight has a disruption. [Travel insurance](https://thepointsguy.com/guide/independent-travel-insurance/) is especially important if the disruption would cause you more financial burden then you are prepared to shoulder yourself.

&#x200B;

Having said that, every airline has their own policies regarding delays, cancellations, etc, and this post is to break down the policy for Southwest Airlines. And one option is off the table from the get go - Southwest does not have an ""interline"" agreement with any other airline so they will not book you on an alternate airline.

&#x200B;

**Standard Policy for Delayed and Canceled Flights:**

If a flight is canceled or delayed for any reason Southwest will attempt to accommodate you on the next available flight to your destination at no additional charge. If they cannot reaccommodate you, or you choose not to travel with Southwest, you can get a full refund of your one-way fare back to the original form of payment regardless of the fare type on the original ticket.

&#x200B;

Southwest may offer additional options depending on the reason for the flight disruption.

&#x200B;

**Schedule change:**

This is often done weeks or months in advance. Based on many business and operational factors (one such recent factor that has been a significant driver of these changes is the FAA grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft), Southwest will rearrange or discontinue some scheduled routes and departure times. In this case, they will email you a new itinerary. But what if that new flight itinerary won't work for you? Southwest will let you rebook your travel at no additional fare difference (remember, they already don't charge change fees) within 14 days  (before or after) of the original dates as long as the originating and destination cities (or their designated ""co-terminals"") remain the same. If this still not acceptable, Southwest will give you a full refund back to the original form of payment regardless of the original fare type. No additional compensation or gestures of goodwill are to be expected, especially due to the advance notice given. Also, read your emails and check your flight status once in a while. I've known of people who've shown up at the airport for flights that were changed months before ""but you didn't tell me"" um...yes, they did.

&#x200B;

**Air Traffic Control Directives/Weather/Airport Issues/TSA or Security/System-wide Outages:**

These are the type of issues that are fully out of Southwest's control. The standard policy of accommodating you on the next available flight or refund is what you can expect. While they understand you are sometimes very significantly put out by these issues, they really are only responsible for your flight. They either fly you (when they can) or refund you. This is what travel insurance is for, people. To protect you when things go wrong on your trip.

&#x200B;

**Mechanical/Crew/Ramp/Operational Issues:**

These are the type of issues that one would expect should be within Southwest's power to control. In addition to the standard policy of reaccommodate or refund, there may be other options offered that Southwest understands is good customer service policy. For instance, if you are going to be stuck in a city overnight that *is not your originating city*, they may offer you a hotel voucher. If you are going to be delayed in the airport for an extended amount of time, they may offer a meal voucher. Often, they will also offer a Southwest LUV Voucher toward future travel for delays more than 2 hours. Sometimes they have the time to be ""pro-active"" and offer these vouchers at the airport. Sometimes you will get an email after the fact with a voucher and an apology. If you feel that your situation may warrant some consideration for a gesture of goodwill and you were not offered one automatically, it doesn't hurt to ask - politely would be nice. The easiest way is to simply contact them through the website rather than by the phone. What not to expect: they aren't going to reimburse you for your missed cruise, or Celine Dion concert tickets, or the non-refundable hotel stay, etc. Again, TRAVEL INSURANCE. It's a thing.

FAQ Friday - Boarding Position,3,ccam4d,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/ccam4d/faq_friday_boarding_position/,3,"Welcome to our first official FAQ Friday her at r/SouthwestAirlines.

&#x200B;

**This week's subject - Boarding Position**

&#x200B;

This is unique to Southwest, which has an open seating policy. To make boarding fast and efficient, they line up all the passengers by groups A, B, and C, and then by number within the groups. This is a video that explains the process:

[The Southwest Boarding Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2B7EilM0pk)

&#x200B;

Open seating is first come, first served, so it is to your advantage to be in the A or B groups, and in the low numbers within those groups, to increase your odds of grabbing your favorite seat.

&#x200B;

So how do you get your boarding position assignment? Well, these, too, are a first come, first served type situation. And, again, there are groups of customers at Southwest that will have priority when those positions are assigned. In order of priority they are:

&#x200B;

1. Business Select Fare Customers
2. A-List Preferred Members
3. A-List Members
4. EarlyBird Check-in Customers
5. Standard Customers (Anytime and Wanna Get Away Fares)

&#x200B;

Within groups, in the case of Business Select, A-List Preferred, and A-List, the priority is determined by the date and time stamp of the ticket purchased. In the case of EarlyBird the date and time stamp of the purchase of product (not the ticket) determines the priority.

&#x200B;

At **36 hours** prior to the time of departure for the flight, the system will automatically assign boarding positions to Business Select, A-List Preferred, A-List, and EarlyBird customers.

At **24 hours** prior to the time of departure for the flight, Standard Customers will be awarded their boarding position at the time of their manual check-in. The earlier you check-in, the earlier your boarding position will be.

&#x200B;

If you didn't get the boarding position you preferred, there is sometimes an opportunity to purchase **Upgraded Boarding** at the gate about 45 minutes prior to departure. Since boarding positions A 1-15 are reserved only for Business Select fares, and Southwest doesn't always sell out this fare class, any unclaimed positions A 1-15 can be purchased for $30-50 depending on the route.

A couple of check-in questions:

1) I plan to check-in on the app as close to the 24-hour mark as possible.  Right now, if I try to check-in on the app, it says ""We can't find this reservation"".  Is this normal until I get within the 24-hour window?

2) I saw in a previous thread from about a year ago that (at least at that time) only the first person listed on the reservation will get their boarding pass on the app, if there is another person they will have to print their boarding pass or get it at the counter.  Is this still the case?  We will be checking luggage, so we can easily get the other pass printed anyway, but I didn't know if anything had changed with regard to the app since that thread.

3) We have non-stop round trip flights.  Will checking in for the outbound also check us in for the return?  Or will we need to check in 24 hours in advance for the return flight?  I know if we had connecting flights, checking in for the first leg of the outbound would check us in for all other legs of the outbound also, but wasn't 100% sure about the return flight(s).

-

I'm chalking-up a miserable Memorial Day to Southwest. I've been flying Southwest for work and personal excursions for years and have had nothing but good experiences... until now. I'd like to vent...

I took a bus from Baltimore to NY to help my mother Memorial Day weekend. My father died unexpectedly in 2017 and she wanted to have a yard sale to start to get rid of some of his junk. This is a big step forward for her, I'm proud of her, and I needed to be there. It was an emotional weekend, and physically demanding one as well. I knew it would be, so I treated myself to a one-way flight back to Baltimore on Monday so I could:

1.Recover from a stressful weekend

2.See my fiance before she left for a work trip Monday afternoon

3.Take a client out Monday evening who is in the US for the first time and lock-down new business for my employer (I work in business relations and development).

I wake up a 5am Monday morning to a text that says my flight was cancelled. No reason why. So I went to the airport. Flight is cancelled and the person at the desk is 100% ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I am given the option to take a flight to Orlando, for a half day layover and then fly to Baltimore. The only other option is to wait for the next available flight which is Tuesday. I could not miss work on Tuesday, that was not an option.

So even though the absolute last thing I wanted to do was sit on I95 in holiday traffic from NY to Baltimore, that is what I did. I rented a car which cost me just over $300 after gas. It took me 8 hours to drive 260 miles. I missed saying goodbye to my fiance, and I missed the potential client. I wanted to pull my hair out.

After a miserable day at work on Tuesday, I got in touch with a Southwest customer service rep. Well first I waited on hold for a little less than an hour. They refunded my flight, yay! I explained everything I just wrote, and after saying they couldn't do anything else, they finally agreed to give me $100. That covers less than a third of the car rental! Thanks a lot Southwest for a Memorial Day I'll always remember.",1559184775.0

Also even though you have TSA precheck they make you take out all the electronics out of of your bag.  And you can forget any drinks you bought at the airport because TSA makes you throw those out due to the re-check.

* Front and back of the planes had the ""party seats"" that faced backwards.  Lots of fun traveling with friends in those rows.

* Lining up one hour before departure to get the plastic boarding cards.  I don't miss that -- nobody wanted to be the first in line, but once one person got in line, thirty or forty people would stand there, often 20 minutes before an agent even arrived at the desk. 

* When the Southwest website went live, they gave double Rapid Rewards credits for online bookings.  That meant four roundtrips earned a free roundtrip.  And there were no seat restrictions.

* Every now and then they'd run ""buy-one-get-one-free"" promotions... almost like a Companion Pass sale.

Also, I wish the website would have told me that my new flight is ALSO delayed by 2+ hours  before booking it.

15000 points is about a $255 ticket.

Option A: Buy 15,000 points for $412. Earn the extra 7,500 pts plus 824 on my CSP. So I’ve earned 8024 pts for spending $412.

There were only 2 people working and the line was 15 people long. They had no sense of urgency to clear the line. It took 30 minutes just to get the gate check tag. We missed preboarding (we have a service dog) because it took so long. I tweeted @SouthwestAir to ask for more staff to be sent down and instead got a template response that ""We assure you our Employees are doing everything they can.""
* When we got to BWI, the stroller came off at the jetway but the car seat did not. It's a combined system so my son has to be in the car seat which attaches to the stroller. So we had to carry him through congested BWI down to baggage claim where it did not come off the carousel after 25 minutes. Went to the baggage office and had to wait in another understaffed line, still carrying a crying infant, for 20 minutes, for them to find it in the back office and not have any explanation why it wasn't delivered on the jetway despite the green gate check tag.

Flew family out on Southwest to watch our kid. We are flying to Oahu, a few days later to Maui, and then a few days later back to CONUS (all on SW). I woke up this morning to check in at 5:45 am for our flights (thru Oakland). 6 hours later got a text stating my flight was canceled and to rebook. WTH?

I was able to rebook for the following day initially and after spending an hour on the phone a flight later the same day became available. However, instead of arriving at 10:45 am, we are now arriving close to 9 pm. So we get there the same day but our $120 (2) tickets for an event that day are useless. We are now paying for what is now essentially an extra day of hotel and car rental and our trip is really one day shorter, 6.9'ish down to 6.1 days. It was already a short trip but now it is barely worth the cost to fly over there but too late to cancel all of our other reservations and plans without losing more $.

Spent a total of 2 hours on the phone with Southwest, finally found out trip was cancelled for ""maintenance"". I was originally told weather, hrrpph...weather is clear. Southwest offered $200 (2) in good faith vouchers. Frustrated.  People often get more than that for being bumped on an ""overbooked flight"". We only ever fly SW. Their on hold messages promoting their amazing customer service are an attempt at brainwashing, because their customer service is terrible.  I would know, spent 1.5 hours of 2 on hold listening to cheery people promising me how amazing they are at not-sucking. And then 30 minutes of them doing the opposite. We feel like we are still getting screwed. Maybe, the Internets would disagree. Southwest certainly does.

I get that ""maintenance"" happens and/or crap hits the fan sometimes. Maybe there just weren't enough passengers to make the 5:45 am flight to Oakland worth it for SW? But if you are going to screw over your customers, please take care of them.  We lost way more money/time today than their ""good-faith"" vouchers could come close to compensating.

Want to cancel instead? SWA is admitting they're going to have major operational issues this summer, so they should let you cancel and get a full refund to payment (i.e. not a voucher), right? Well, SWA says no way!

Really, it's not the fault of passengers that SWA decided to ""bet the farm"" on an entirely Boeing 737 fleet -- a single airplane built by a manufacturer that has had documented quality troubles since the Dreamliner grounding.

SWA needs to own their operational issues with the Max, not punish passengers with uncertainty. **This isn't a weather issue or a war -- it's SWA not having enough safe planes to fly.** 

The way SWA is handling their summer scheduling is appalling. People book specific dates because they want to travel on those specific dates. Now SWA is nudging people to change them, all while literally admitting they will just use this new information to ""make any adjustments"" necessary.

Shame on you, SWA.",1556066722.0

If it doesn't, I hear SW will put gate check like other airlines, but instead of getting it on the jetway you go to baggage claim? What if that flight is a connection, and I take another flight out? Will it do what checked baggage does and go to the next plane to the next destination?

Is it not a reasonable expectation that your airline of choice gets you home the same DAY as your flight?,7,bb1jpx,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/bb1jpx/is_it_not_a_reasonable_expectation_that_your/,13,"I had a bad experience with Southwest, with whom I am a loyal customer, over the weekend.

I was flying home from LAX to HOU at 11:30 AM. Unfortunately the weather in Houston was projected to be poor from 2-3 PM CST. Due to this weather, my flight was cancelled at 6 AM. Not delayed, but completely cancelled.

I would have gladly accepted a delay or a changed flight to later in the afternoon/evening, but I got neither of those things, as the remaining flights for the day were full.
Sorry luck, at least I can trust that Southwest will book a flight for me on another airline though, right? Surely they will get me home before the work week begins. No such luck.

I spoke with 3 separate employees (who were frankly pretty rude when I expressed that I needed to get home today, period, for work reasons) and none of the three so much as apologized: ""There is nothing we can do about weather sir."" 

Great, I completely understand that there is no way to control the weather, but I feel it's a reasonable expectation that my airline makes arrangements to get me home some time in the hours between my cancelled flight and the work week.

Here's the kicker: I bought 2 tickets onto a United flight which left **1 hour** after my scheduled Southwest flight. I know there are many factors which go into the decision to cancel a flight but the weather clearly isn't the main reason, as I was able to take a flight 1 hour later **into the same airport**.

$1200 later (which I'm extremely grateful we could even afford) I made it home with my girlfriend with nothing to show for my troubles from Southwest other than a refund for my original ticket points.

So I ask, is it not reasonable to expect your airline to make arrangements to get you home 12-14 hours after your scheduled flight? Southwest did not do me that courtesy, and now I am out over $1000 for same-day tickets.",1554799590.0

Likelihood more flights will be added closer to date?,1,b7uhhr,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/b7uhhr/likelihood_more_flights_will_be_added_closer_to/,4,"Hey guys, so possibly stupid question.  I am trying to book a flight through Southwest for this summer (the week that July turns into August, 2019). It is important to me that it is a nonstop flight. Searching on Southwests website I found 1 nonstop there and 1 nonstop back home. The times are not ideal, but if that's my only option I will definitely be doing it.

 

My question is, is there any chance more flights will be added for different times, closer to the date? I am assuming no, but I thought I would ask here before I went through and bought the flight. This is my first time flying southwest where I am booking by myself so I have no idea.

Lost Snowboard Bag,1,b7ik9j,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/b7ik9j/lost_snowboard_bag/,3,"So I was traveling to Denver and waited for my snowboard luggage to come out and it never did. So I went to talk to the clerk and was told that the bag was never sent even though the same checked bags we checked with arrived. He then told me that once the snowboard bag arrives they will send it to the place we were staying at. This all happened at 8 AM in the morning and was told that the snowboard bag would be at our place by 12. Then they offered us a voucher for rentals for the day (Good but not really). 

&#x200B;

So the day goes on and we were told they would call us to update us on the bag when it arrives at 12. When 12 comes around, no call. We called them back, was then told it was on the second flight that would arrive at 4:30. We waited till 430/5 and still no update. We called back and was then told that the luggage ended up in a different state.... Which blows my mind because we were told it was in transit to our location. And the last call recently, a man was very rude to us on the phone when we asked about another voucher for the second day  and how would it work bc the voucher is only good for 1 day and the rental place only accepts the voucher once from southwest. He then said with incredible attitude that we dont need the voucher and that our luggage would be coming in tonight. (Which I find so hard to believe after today)

Just wanted to share a closing update.

I am happy to report after months of calls and persistance, SWA finally agreed to reimburse what they had initially promised - the full amount (after first offering me a fifth of the amount...then a third... then half in cash).

I had recieved half in the form of 2 checks. I respecfully said I would not cash them. I was on the phone with another senior representative from claims giving me reasons as to why I would not get fully reimbursed and that it was ""surprising"" they reimbursed me even half. After the not so calm exchange of being told to get things in writing, that theyd speak with the individual who made the initial promise etc, I finally said this:

""Before giving me your final ""no"", I think it's important to have one final conversation with whomever over the approval of my reimbursement. Ask yourselves if it's worth it to send legal counsel to fight this in civil court vs paying me the rest of what I am owed. Ask yourself if it really is so ""surprising"" that I even got half - maybe you know you've done wrong, maybe you've already spoken to the employee. I'd imagine civil court would be more costly to you than to me, for it's only $25 for me to file and I don't need a lawyer. Ask yourselves what I am capable of after all the work I've put in and all the rejections I've been given from you for something I was promised. You'll be hearing from me soon should I not hear from you. As I've said, a win or a loss for me is undoubtedly a loss for you.""

2 days later I recieved an email noting the rest of the reimbursement would be on it's way in the form of a 3rd check.


Lessons learned: 

Never give up on something you did not do wrong. 

Get in-person promises in writing, maybe even recorded on audio if they seem too good to be true. 

Never cash a partial reimbursement check, that could be interpretted as you consenting to partial reimbursement.

Always be nice, even when it's hard to be. I'll admit I didn't do a very good job of being nice. These folks are just doing their job in the end. They are victims of the system.

Know the power of social media done correctly. Luckily I didn't have to resort to social media, only Reddit for information gathering.

Know the power of small claims & civil court when you know you're right. Have that proof in writing or audio? You may need it.

Southwest's decision to not ground the Boeing 737 MAX 8's have me wondering where else Southwest is cutting corners.,0,b0guco,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/b0guco/southwests_decision_to_not_ground_the_boeing_737/,41,"**Edit** 

Yeah, keep attacking me. 

**Don't you wonder how I knew the planes would be grounded the night before it happened?.** 

I predict a troubled couple years for Southwest Air. Don't worry, they'll probably survive. Probably. I don't think they deserve to, but no one cares what I think. 

**Edit**

Thank God the US government has banned these planes. That action likely saved hundreds of lives and the company itself. Not that Southwest deserves it. The entire world knew the planes should be grounded, and the entire world grounded them. Yet Southwest was willing to risk killing hundreds of people, because grounding the planes would have cost them money.

# Southwest hires people to downvote, argue with, and bury disfavorable social media comments. 

It's called reputation management, it's real, and it's very dishonest. This sub has 10x the activity that it should. Within an hour of saying something negative, you'll have a ton of downvotes & responses defending the company. On this sub, no more than a dozen or two people should even seen any post within an hour, and here on reddit, fewer than 5% of readers comment.

Yet this sub has a 100% or higher engagment rate.  AMAZING.

They pretend to be regular customers, and they repeat PR talking points nearly verbatim.  Look at the virtually non-existent account histories.  

This isn't a conspiracy theory. There was a big reddit scandal about 5 years ago where reputation management firms were caught running scripts against reddit that tried the username as the password, or tried the word ""password."" Hundreds of thousands of accounts were claimed. They're called ""aged accounts,"" and they're used for this sort of bullshit deception. 

This subreddit is not reality. It's marketing, and it's offensive. 

They think you are this stupid.

If you ever fly this airline again, you are an absolute fool. They hate you. 

This company is garbage.

Edit: Word is Trump will ban the planes from flying tomorrow. Thank God.

I am about to spend a shitload of money to re-book my mother (who flies Southwest about a dozen times each year) on another carrier. 

2 / 350 of this new model crashed. That is a 0.57%  failure rate. 

Put that in perspective: There are about 100,000 flights each day. If 0.57% of them crashed, there'd be 570 crashes every single day.

The decision to not ground the planes (like the rest of the world has done) is about one thing: Money.

**It is not possible for Southwest to have ""full confidence"" in this plane when no one has any idea how or why the last one crashed.** 

Two days ago I'd have told the world what an awesome airline Southwest is. Like I've been doing for 20 years. Today, I can safely say that I will never step foot on a Southwest plane ever again. Trust--gone. Affection--gone. All of it, in 30 seconds. 

This decision isn't just reckless, it's unconscionable. 

There is something majorly wrong with any company that makes this decision. I can only imagine where else they're gambling.

It didn’t roll me over automatically or anything.  The next flight with availability is at 8pm.  Bonus, I now have a really bad boarding position.

That’s it. What?  Literally no apology and no compensation at all?  It’s 100% their fault- they can’t get their mechanics in to work.  No weather issue involved at all.  Every other time (on other airlines) this has happened to me, rare but still, they refund the ticket and also put you on the next flight, or offer a voucher. Something. In the system. Automatically. 

Is that really it?  Just “Sucks to be you.  Good luck getting on another flight today!”  What can I do and how/who/what should I ask for?

Wondering what my options are as my trip is pretty much ruined by southwest? 

I will add that the delay was not due to weather at all, it was ""mechanical"", they wouldn't mention specifics. 

Edit: I dont even have my ikon ski pass, i wasnt smart enough to put it in my backpack so it's going to cost me another $150 roughly a day to ski....",1550854756.0

Original Post:

My goal for posting my recent (and ongoing) incident with Southwest is to spur a discussion. 

* Do you have a similar experience with Southwest? 
* How about another airline and what actions did they take to resolve the case? 
* Do you think I'm in the wrong, the right, neutral? 
* Don't care and just browsing some posts? - all good! 

&#x200B;

**Spark-note version:**

* Snowboard bag (holding all gear, outerwear, layers, etc) didn't arrive at destination and was delivered next day to resort 4 hours away from airport.
* Was told to go to a specific resort shop with whom Southwest has a relationship. Southwest would cover the board/boots/helmet rental and I was told I'd be reimbursed (""we'll cut you a check"") for anything that was not covered under rental - jacket, snow pants, gloves, goggles, etc.
* Receipt in hand from said resort shop, I was denied full reimbursement given a choice of accepting a third of it in the form of voucher or was told to submit formal claim 
* 30 days following the claim submission I was told they would reimburse a third of the purchase in the form of $USD - an amount they considered reasonable. I made it clear I would not accept the check. They let me know a senior employee would reach out. It's been another two weeks and still no word, only an uncashed check. 

What do you think? 

&#x200B;

**Full story**

I flew Southwest for the very first time mid-December 2018 to snowboard some Denver resorts - Copper, Aspen, etc. Aside from this case I'm fighting, I'd say all-in-all good airline - timely app updates, nice first-come-first-serve seating model and friendly staff. 

I arrive at Denver airport, but my snowboard bag didn't - this has my gear and all my layers and outerwear needed to snowboard. After consulting with the (admittedly awesome) staff in the claim area, they believed - but couldn't guarantee - that the board bag would arrive on the next flight, touching down in an hour and a half. We  dropped some stuff off at a friend's place we were crashing at and we drove back to find out the bag hadn't made the second flight and was definitely still in NY. I was told the bag would arrive the following day at Noon.

It's now about 11pm and I need to be on the road Aspen-bound at 4am with 3 others whose bags all arrived. Knowing the 3 of them shouldn't have to depart later than planned and give up a vacation day on the slopes , I headed to the Southwest claims office to inquire about bag delivery service. 

The employee handled the situation impressively even more so because he looked as exhausted as I was! He immediately setup bag delivery for the following night, no charge. He gave me a voucher and told me to go to a **specific resort shop with whom the airline had a relationship** in the village to pick up the board rental (boots & helmet included) and anything I needed to purchase additionally would be reimbursed to me. In his words, ""Hold on to the receipt, bring it back to us, we'll cut you a check."" 

Ever been to a resort / village shop? Yeah, a *cheap* jacket alone is $500 easy (which turned out to be true), not to mention gloves, goggles or snow pants. I reiterated this to him and he responded, ""...cut you a check"" and that they do this for families of five all the time. 

Fast forward 3 days, receipt in hand at the same office I was gravely told they would not cover my expenses. They would give me $300 or a $500 travel voucher, a third of the purchase. I was even handed a paper advertising where I *could have* rented jackets and other outerwear. I tried to explain I was told to go to a specific shop and the whole ""cut you a check"" conversation. I was told they couldn't take my side or the employee's. They told me I could file a formal case for full reimbursement, gave me that number to call and sent me off. 

I called the number, filed a reimbursement claim with a friendly agent on the phone and was told to visit a site, describe the incident and upload receipts and other documents then wait about 30 days before hearing back. Knowing I needed to pay off the credit statement before that (among the payments I just paid for moving apartments) I was pretty frustrated. Financially it definitely took its toll and before you start jumping to conclusions, because of the whole Aspen thing (ever heard of it??) no I'm not rich, I support myself down to health insurance early in my career and save for these trips because I love the hobby.

Fast forward 30 days, I get a reply saying they'd mail me a check for $500, what they deem is reasonable. I reply I will not accept the check. They reply someone senior will respond to me in 7 - 10 business days. On the 11th business day I check in and notify them of an address change. I am told to hang tight, I will be contacted at the earliest opportunity. I get the check, but I refuse to cash it. I'm still waiting for a reply. 14th business day...",1550135489.0

Is this common practice?,2,akuro3,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/akuro3/is_this_common_practice/,3,"Last Saturday, I was traveling from Austin to Indianapolis with a stopover in Atlanta. Shortly after take off from Austin, the pilot announced that we were returning to Austin because the windshield on the plane cracked.

We got back safely and customer service worked as fast as possible to re-book everyone. There were 7 in our party and the plan was for us to fly to Atlanta for the night, Southwest would provide hotel rooms, and then we would fly home to Indianapolis on Sunday. They also gave us $200 vouchers. All good, shit happens, not a huge deal (for me personally, others in the group were upset about not getting home Saturday). 

I asked the customer service agent if we would get our bags in Atlanta before agreeing to this option (although I don't know what other options we had). She confirmed that we would claim our luggage in Atlanta, then check it again the next morning before our flight. None of us wanted to spend the night without our luggage.

However, we get to Atlanta and our bags are not on the carousel (and neither are the bags for anyone else who was our on original flight). In the baggage claim office, we were told that our bags were put into a ""holding facility"" somewhere  in the airport THAT WE WERE IN but that it wasn't their policy to give us the bags in a situation like this. If we had an emergency need, we could wait up to 3 hours for them to attempt a bag but they couldn't just get all of our bags because we wanted them. We would get them at our final destination.

Is this standard procedure? Why in the hell would they send us to a hotel for the night without our bags, when those bags were on the plane with us? This just makes no sense to me. 

To make matters worse, the hotel they provided was the most disgusting, dirty hotel I've ever been in. If I'd had any clue, I would have found and paid for a hotel on my own. But it was late and I was with co-workers so I stayed. If I'd been alone, I'm not sure what I would have done. I would not have felt safe staying there alone. Honestly, sitting in the airport all night would have been better. One of my colleagues did say that the hotel was well below others he has stayed in on a Southwest voucher.

I guess my question is just about the baggage thing ... is that common practice? I feel inclined to complain about it to customer service but I wanted to do some research first. I'm not expecting anything else from them but I want to draw attention to it. And the quality of the hotel, so they are aware.

And I've learned my lesson: never travel without a change of clothes and necessities in my carry on.

I have two buddies also on the flight who I don't think checked in any earlier.

Obviously, I doubt we will be sitting together or possibly all be in middle seats due to the ""luxury"" of terrible Southwest airlines and their craptacular check-in system. I do not believe their seating system saves time whatsoever and it punishes people flying together obviously.

I’m flying to visit my friend in atlanta on the 18th, i booked my flight with southwest about a month ago. At the time it was cheaper to fly out of Richmond, VA - Atlanta, then into my home airport of Norfolk. But, the person who was driving me to richmond canceled and I had no way of getting to the airport. So I had two options either cancel half my flight on southwest and book a one way out of norfolk. Or pay the $259 change fee to fly out of Norfolk and get in to atlanta at 12 am. At the time I wanted to get information as to if it was possible to cancel half the reservation (as i was unsure at the time). So I gave SWA a phone call and provided my confirmation number, then simply asked “is it possible to cancel half of my flight?” This was a question not a request, but she proceed to say “it is, I have canceled the first half of your trip. $167 in travel funds have been attached to this confirmation number and they expire on Feb 12th, 2019.” After hearing this I said “I didn’t want the flight to be canceled I just needed an answer to my question.” She then said it will cost an extra $40 to put me back onto my flight from richmond!!! This is insane as for one I didn’t ask for her to cancel the reservation. Secondly the funds expire in a month, when would i be able to use them!? I have already booked another 1 way flight from Norfolk to atlanta, I just feel I should either have my travel funds extended or a refund to my card. ",1547092719.0

But she doesn't know what the fee will be. So that sounded a lil wonky. I sent email to see if I  could get that in writing, and my response was pretty much use the credits by expiration or loose em.  So I emailed back but haven't heard anything. Came here to see if anyone had some advice.

Update: called the new # I was given. So essentially call back after travel funds expire. Get 6 month extension but will cost 100$ a ticket. The lady gave me a email address to see about maybe a full refund if I supply proper documentation. I looked at current prices, if we just buckle down and take the old man in his wheelchair we're only out additional 33$. Vs the 300$ for a 6 month extension.

Good flight so far. Took off a few minutes late thanks to people in the last boarding group walking past middle seats on a full flight.

Wife has flight anxiety so I'll be buying her a cocktail once drink service starts.

Lots of dogs on board. They're all being very good.


Edit: one hour into flight, approaching Tucson.

Wild Turkey 101 & Ginger ales have been ordered and paid for, waiting for the little cart to reach row 9. All the spirits were $7 so might as well go for the one 101 proof.

Wife likes to watch the little plane on the flight tracker, helps her anxiety.


Edit 2: 1:20 into flight, still over AZ?

Drinks came. No cart actually, flight attendant came with like 20 drinks balanced on a waiter's tray. Bravo, I'd be nervous to do that on solid ground, much less with the possibility of turbulence.

Dude made a good strong drink!

Edit 3: 2hours 43 minutes remaining in flight. 38% remaining in phone battery.

Just crossed into Texas and the seatbelt light came on. Wife doesn't like this. She's an expert on what parts of North America have bad turbulence and says Texas is bad.

She's ordered herself another 101 and Ginger ale I'm stealing sips from.

Edit 4: lots of shaking and wife doesn't like it. Flight crew asked to take their seats. Captain is going to climb a bit to try to smooth out flight.

Final: Landed at TPA. Good flight other than the turbulence. Feel bad for the folks on this plan who are going with it to Ohio next. Can't believe LAX to Tampa to Columbus is a real flight you can book.",1545372379.0

Advice on applying for Rewards Card once new year starts but want tickets for flight early Jan?,2,a7x7i5,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/a7x7i5/advice_on_applying_for_rewards_card_once_new_year/,4,"So I'll be flying a lot next year and wanted to get the Rewards Card to guarantee getting my hands on the Companion Pass ASAP for the year after. 

I've never done any of their rewards programs before but from what I've read, the common thing to do is to wait until the new year actually starts to apply; I'm assuming because you want the annual billing cycle to begin on January in case you ever want to cancel. 

My issue is that I want to book tickets for a flight early January (first two weeks) for myself and another person and don't know how I would get those purchases to qualify on the new card? I'm guessing it takes a few days to process as well as mail the card, so I'd have it in my hands like the day right before the flight when it's too late to book. Ideally I want to buy the tickets now or ASAP because of availability, is there a way to apply for the card and have it mailed before the new year but tell Southwest not to activate it/begin the billing cycle until Jan 1 or something? 

I called Southwest's customer service to ask but they redirected me to Chase because it had to with the card and then they redirected me back to Southwest the moment I mentioned the Rewards program because it had to do with Southwest. ",1545335898.0

No Pilot - No Graduation,0,9uhnan,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/9uhnan/no_pilot_no_graduation/,16,5 whole minutes before boarding we were told there was no pilot for our plane. I asked why and was told that “he timed out or something “ by the counter supervisor. She said they were scrambling to fly someone in from Oakland but were having problems... my son missed his college graduation commencement and his dad and I missed our dream of seeing him walk in cap and gown!  They let us know that “they would refund us in two billing cycles “ and gave us $200 worthless vouchers.  We tried every other airline and we couldn’t get from SLC to Indianapolis by 8AM . They now refuse to pay for non refundable hotel. Bethany at Corporate can do ZERO for us- but she understands- she graduated in May- she got to walk and her mom got to watch.... but she understands!  Does this sound even a tiny bit ethical to anyone else? ,1541480957.0

I Got Excellent Ticket Counter Service: Advice?,20,9tkvdi,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/9tkvdi/i_got_excellent_ticket_counter_service_advice/,13,"Yesterday, I show up at my local airport for a quick, one-day round trip on SW to do a very tightly scheduled, final round series of interviews for a job I really, really need. The stakes were even higher, in fact, because the execs I needed to meet in person were only going to be at HQ that day and I believe I'm right in assuming they don't give a shit about people with a portfolio full of excuses (does anybody really?).

Anyway, the company's travel coordinator had sent me an itinerary and confirmation number the day before. However, southwest.com hadn't allowed me to check in at the 24 hour mark even though the error it threw said it recognized my information, because of some restriction on checking in due to how the ticket had been booked (through an agency at the last minute, I think).

Anyway, I had a lot to do to get ready for the interview on less than 24 hours notice, so I did those things and then went to the airport that morning assuming I could check in at the kiosk when I got there and ... no dice.

\*swallow the panic\*

So I went to the ticket counter. It was about 6:15 for a 7:25 departure. They couldn't find the ticket either. There wasn't anything in the system.

\*take two gulps of panic ... push it down\*

Be fair to the other passengers--get out of line look through emails. Did I miss something? No. Am I forgetting a magic number to try? No. Can I get through to the company's travel coordinator? Flying east early in the morning, so again, no. Do I have time to wait for her to get online? Nope!

\*gulp, gulp, gulp\*

So finally I noticed a number for the travel ""agency"" at the bottom my itinerary in the fine print and gave them a call. Lo and behold a human on the other end is able to confirm to me that there is no ticket! The reservation had been canceled ""for non-payment"" due to a technical error with the reservation software. It's 06:35.

\*push that shit down, motherfucker!\*

I get back to the ticket counter a few minutes later (thank little baby Jesus for short lines) and talk to a different agent. I explain to her what happened. I'm calm, but damn. I want this job. I'm sure she could tell how I was feeling.

In the next 10 minutes she handles it. Period. She books me a new flight on the exact same itinerary and even though I should have had to fly standby on my first leg because of how late I booked she got me a boarding pass printed and even managed to remember to tell me which gate to sprint to.

\*run!\*

The flight was on time. The interviews went well. No final word yet, but I'm expecting an offer early next week.

\*success!\*

Here's the advice part: I already tweeted out to SW and DM'd them details so they can give the ticket counter agent ""kudos."" However, I feel this is not enough. She most likely made me a lot of money because when I got to my interview several of the people I talked to remarked on how the initiative I showed make it there under the circumstances was exactly what they were looking for in a candidate. And given that my profession is taking care of clients as well, I would have to say her initiative in understanding the situation and bending the rules for me and doing everything with competence and a smile is \*exactly\* what any company should strive to reward beyond the normal bullshit, cheapo, celebration.

So what else can I do to see that she gets a bonus/raise/promotion or something beyond a plastic lay and a round of applause?! Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR: I got excellent service from a ticket counter agent at SW. She saved my ass, in fact, and has likely helped me to make a lot of money. Now I want to make sure she gets more than a pat on the back. What can I do beyond calling her out on social media?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I don't have a-list status with SW, but, based on your advice, I was at least able to get her a ""Kick Tail"" coupon via their social media team. And that does have some tangible value. So, thanks! 

Still doesn't seem like enough to me because I'm a client guy and I think companies should get with the times and put their money where their mouth is when it comes to advocating for their customers' success. You can't just reward bean counters and sales and expect to generate advocates for your brand. There's too much competition in a global market that has an Internet! But, hey, at least it's not just a little rah rah applause at the next weekly meeting. ",1541199785.0

As a ticketed passenger, my flight from MCO was scheduled to depart at 6:45am through Dallas to Tulsa. One problem, they boarded early and put me on standby through St. Louis (later time and longer route) even though I made the cut off time; apparently numerous other ticketed passengers faced the same dilemma.

So I wait around MCO so I can get on the flight to St. Louis, once landed there was no gate agent so I had to wander though STL to find a SWA customer service desk. Once there, I got my connecting boarding pass-- except they sent me to the Omaha gate down the way... Finally, I ran to the Tulsa gate right as they were closing it.

I arrive in Tulsa, and Budget had given away my car reservation and only had 15 passenger vans available... so I waited another hour for a 41mpg car.

I was 3 hours behind schedule for work. Thankfully the remainder of my time went well during my workation. :)

While there are some alternative flights I can take with different airlines, the flight times are not ideal. 

My question is, can I (companion) take a SW flight without my girlfriend (member) present?  After reading SW's website on the matter, I see that this is not technically allowed under their rules but I'm wondering how strict they are about it.

Yes, people come in all shapes and sizes in this world, but plane seats come in one size on Southwest — this is not an attempt to fat shame but an attempt to point out how I was unable to use ⅓ of my seat and had to sit in an uncomfortable position the entirety of the flight - all the while paying a full fare for ⅔ of a seat

I fly a few times a year, to specific destinations and at specific times of the year. I have no loyalty to any carrier. I don't care about miles, loyalty programs, lounge access, preferred boarding, or whether or not you serve nuts. My sole motivation in selecting a carrier is ""which airline can get me to my destination at a convenient hour, in a reasonable time and for a reasonable price"". All else being equal, then if I've had a good prior experience with an airline, that'll bias my choice in their favour, but I also hold a grudge when I've not.

Up until recently I've flown mostly with Air Alaska, Frontier and Delta beause they were the most convenient, and you've never appeared on the flight aggregators I use. But for the last couple of flights, on the advice of a friend, I've flown with you.

The flights themselves were fine, but here's why I won't fly with you again. 

Whenever I have to give my personal information to a merchant - whether it's for an online purchase, to rent a car, to book a hotel room, or to book a flight - I do my best to request that my information not be used for marketing purposes. I don't want junk mail and I hate spam emails. I'm usually on call for my job, and emails come through to my phone at all hours of the day and night and can wake me up when something needs fixing. And nothing pisses me off more than being woken from sleep by a email trying to sell me something I don't want. I find that the majority of companies respect the wishes of people like me and make a total opt out a simple matter of clicking a checkbox. Most companies seem to realize that anyone's who's vociferous about this is likely to be hostile to marketing, and no sensible company wants hostile customers.

You don't seem to have caught on to this simple courtesy. 

The first red flag should have been that you're one of the few retailers who wouldn't let me use a disposable email address to buy my ticket. And so I reluctantly gave you my real email. A couple of weeks after my flights the spam started. That was a simple fix, just adding the entire southwest.com domain to my blocklist prevented you from sending me any further email and that was the end of that. But yesterday I got my first credit card application bearing your logo, and that's the nail in the coffin.

I'm not going to throw a tantrum and demand that you stop doing this, I'm just going to point out a few things. First my personal information was given to you because I'm legally mandated to do so as a requirement of flying. It wasn't given to you as part of the currency of our transaction. Second, if I try to ask you to do something that I believe to be reasonable (opt out from marketing) and you obfuscate the process to make it complex and difficult to do (which you have) and then insist on your right to do it anyway despite my wishes then I'm just going to think you're an asshole company and I won't use you again. 

The calculus is that simple, and there's not a single thing that you can now do to remedy it.

I hope the profit you made from selling my personal information exceeds what you would have made from me as a paying customer over the next few years, because you won't be getting another cent from me. And every time I get another letter from a third party, with your logo on the front, all it'll do is remind me of what an asshole company you are.

sincerely

When we started chatting on the plane, we quickly realized that we both worked for same company and lived only a few miles away from each other. Despite our close proximity, it took a Southwest flight (and maybe some fate) to bring us together.

She was supposed to fly yesterday but her plane originated from Chicago and was delayed 3 hours resulting in her whole flight being canceled and rebooked for today.  After a 1+ hour delay, the airport losing power once and just general crappiness she was able to make it from Fort Myers today to Atlanta for the end of her first leg.  However, the flight was so delayed she was actually told to sprint (while holding our 1 year old son) to the gate for her second leg.  She was in the terminal for maybe 15 minutes.  SHe then made it to Philly where we connected.  We waited at baggage claim for probably an hour before giving up.  A good car seat with luggage bag cover, a near brand new stroller, 1 suitcase, and 1 duffle is missing in action.  We know it's definitely no ones fault in philly and probably no ones fault in general so we're not really mad.

Southwest changing price of flights 5 seconds after you search and select...try to search again the same flight and price is back to the original price until you try to buy...click bait?,1,93mdp5,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/93mdp5/southwest_changing_price_of_flights_5_seconds/,12,"So...**click bait** or not?

After going with Southwest for over a decade, using them for every trip as I have been a huge SWA fan because of how darn transparent they are along with great prices/baggage policies, I have my first major gripe and I am now incredibly disappointed. Their new website seems to be ""click bait"" for some of the cheaper flights like a SLC to PHX  45 minute direct. Here are the order of events and why I feel this is click bait and pushing me to go Delta this time around as I am good with higher prices....I am NOT GOOD with tricks...SWA is dependable and transparent...or at least it has been. I want to believe this is just a big mistake but it seems quite deliberate.

* Went to [southwest.com](https://southwest.com)
* Searched for a flight from SLC to PHX on 21st of August for 2 adults
* Found a 2:40PM direct for $103
* Selected it, click continue
* A pop up (attached image) comes up telling me the flight price has changed because ... ""things move pretty fast in this biz""...apparently or not...
* I am disappointed in the price change but I get this may happen but curious how in 5 seconds the price changes.

[magically the price changes](https://i.redd.it/92lh0gkg9fd11.png)

So now I am going to jump on a different browser...cookies get you so lets rule them out by using a browser I never use...sorry Edge.

SAME EXACT thing happened....found it at $103 and then it tells me it is more once I hit continue and try to buy it, specifically $152.98.....so now my suspicions are at full tilt. I redo the search on both browsers and it is still $103 until I click it within 5 seconds of the search to purchase and then it is $152.98....what the heck...

I tried this same process with every 111 and 103 priced ticket for that day and days around it...same result.

So then I jump on to my work laptop which has everything VPN'd to California's corp HQ of my company and do this all again through a browser that I do not use...sorry again Edge...so I do not have any cookie/login items that follow me and tell SWA website I am the same person. Guess what....$103....until I click it and then it is instantly 152.98.

Finally I tried this same process with a non-stop going from SLC to Denver....same issue...low price at first and then when I try to buy it says something has changed with a higher price.

Sure looks like **click bait** to me...",1533132141.0

Never Flying Southwest Again!!!,0,92bw0u,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/92bw0u/never_flying_southwest_again/,43,"What a horrible experience! Please allow me to share the terrible circumstances my daughter and I found ourselves in on 7/22, 7/23 and 7/24- each and every one due to the disorganization of your airline- one that I once used primarily and trusted beyond a shadow of a doubt.

My 15-year-old daughter and I arrived at the Denver International Airport on Sunday, July 22 to catch our flight to Orlando only to find out the flight had been cancelled earlier in the day because of weather in FL. I understand weather is a point of concern but why wasn’t I notified?! When I booked the flight, I left both my email address and my cell phone number on the website in case of these eventualities. Apparently, the reason I wasn’t notified is that my travel was booked through “Southwest Vacations”, a “third party travel agency” (according to SWA customer service. This is puzzling as “Southwest Vacations) is available directly on the Southwest Airlines website. If I had known the flight had been cancelled ahead of time, I would have stayed in Denver and rebooked for the next day but instead, we were stuck. I was offered neither a hotel room for the evening nor a meal voucher to account for extra time we would have to spend in the squalid Denver airport because this was a “weather delay” which is a lie because other flights from SWA and other airlines seemed to have no problem getting into Orlando at times similar to our promised arrival time. Additionally, SWA should know that the weather in Orlando is often rainy in summer afternoons. Are you not prepared for this? Have you not factored this into your flight plans??

This was just the beginning of our Southwest catastrophe. I agreed to be placed on another flight to Orlando that day with a connection in Nashville. My daughter and I waited four more hours only to find out that the connecting flight from Nashville to Orlando had also been cancelled! I was forced to fly to Nashville, spend the night and was booked on a flight to Orlando the next day with a connection in Kansas City. We did leave for Nashville (delayed, of course) and were forced to be seated apart from each other due to our manipulated boarding position. She is 15 years old and was forced to sit between two very unsavory characters with me seated many rows behind, helpless.

The nightmare continues. When we arrived at the Nashville airport the morning of 7/23, we found out that our connecting flight to Orlando from Kansas City to Orlando had been cancelled. I was absolutely numb at this point but agreed to be booked on a flight the next day, 7/24 to Orlando while also attempting to fly standby on a flight from Nashville to Orlando at 2:40 pm on 7/23. Also, while at the Nashville airport waiting, I contacted SWA customer service (after being on hold for 40 minutes) and was treated rudely by an agent who complained he was tired- I wish I could empathize.

So here we sit in Nashville, disgusted and betrayed by SWA with, I’m afraid, our nightmare is not nearly over. We are booked on a 5:50am flight from Nashville to Orlando on 7/24- not super optimistic.

My friends, I feel that you got behind on your schedule and chose to cancel my original flight based on discretion, not weather. I feel victimized and I don’t like being lied to nor do I appreciate being placated by your Denver staff under the moniker of “we are so sorry, what can we do to help you?” You cancelled my original flight and the Nashville to Orlando flight because you were overwhelmed.",1532721605.0
Early Bird - Worth It?,1,923b33,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/923b33/early_bird_worth_it/,3,"Flying for business early next week, non-stop BWI --> LAX and back. Is getting early bird check-in worth it? Neither flights are red-eye or crazy early/late, but getting a decent seat (read: window and not right next to the bathroom) would be solid since I'll be stuck in that spot for 5 ½ hours and then again a few days later. I fly Southwest a decent amount, and tend to get somewhere in the B boarding group, which typically gets me an okay seat, since I'm typically flying alone. That being said, I'm also usually on short 1-2 hour east coast legs, and I'm feeling a bit more anxious than usual about finding somewhere comfortable to sit given the distance.

I'd like to do the early bird, but unsure how much it will really help me because I'm pretty sure I got the cheapest fares, and I'd only be purchasing the actual early bird addition less than 3 days in advance of my Sun. AM flight. Would this impact my ability to be able to land an A boarding pass, even with early bird? Is it worth the $15? (Note that yes, I'm traveling for business, so **technically** I could expense it, but I work for a small non-profit and the last-minute tickets were a cool $800 and I'm not looking to add to that total, so I'd be paying the $30 outta pocket myself and again... nonprofit.)",1532648232.0
Does the customer service line still not work out of the country? A long story about being stranded in another country,1,922fz9,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/922fz9/does_the_customer_service_line_still_not_work_out/,3,"A few months ago I took Southwest to the Dominican Republic. Getting there was good. Smooth flight with some cool scenery on the way looking at all of the islands you pass. Getting into the country is a bit sketchy, but that isn't Southwest's fault. Lets cut to the flight home. Tl;dr at the bottom.

About 10 min after takeoff I notice that was haven't gone very high. Soon after the pilot informs us something is broken and they have to turn back. We land and they park off to the side and get to work. It's a Southwest ""Classic"" plane. After about an hour we are still sitting around. I think about 20 min after that they finally offer to let people off the plane with the condition that they are off for good and staying with the night. A few people take it, but we were fine potentially waiting longer and actually getting out of there. After about 2 hours they tell us all to get off and we can go into the terminal for food and we get a $10 food voucher for in the terminal. I know this is a Spanish speaking country, and it's probably on me for not knowing a lick of Spanish. Nonetheless, the gate employees can barely understand or speak a word of English. Considering this Southwest destination only exists because of American tourist I don't think it's unreasonable that they hire bi-lingual employees. Or at the very least have a supervisor on duty who is fluent in English.

They try to hand out vouchers, but insist on checking everyone's ID. This is on top of someone who doesn't speak English trying to call out names over the terrible PA system. Finally a passenger takes over and just starts shouting. My wife and I say F this and just go buy food. Turns out the voucher was only good at a Wendy's anyways.

Eventually they tell us that we're screwed, and the flight is cancelled for good. I think it was one of the tarmac crew who eventually tells us that a plane is being flown down for us and will depart at noon. They get us onto charter busses and take us to the stranded Southwest Passenger Hotel. Obviously we get a little nervous that we are just being bussed to a random hotel. It actually is the only positive. They take us to the same resort we just stayed at. So when we get there we at least know what bars to hit. This is now late at night though for what was like a 4pm flight.

**Well we try to call Southwest customer service, and the phone number works, but you get a message, IN SPANISH, and then it hangs up on you.** At this point we are luckily my mom is awake and was able to call Southwest and try to figure what is happening. The rep says there is a noon flight, but they can't really do anything else to help. Our tickets were autobooked on the next day's 4:00 flight, fyi, so we have that as a backup. Next day we depart in super sketchy vans at 8am to the airport. We get there (again I know it's a Spanish speaking country), and not a single employee knows a word of English. They weren't informed of the situation, or that the noon flight exist. We ask, try to get someone else to help, but we end up on the 4:00 flight and our bag is checked with that flight. They are adamant it doesn't exist. So F it, we go into the terminal and maybe hope we can get on the noon flight that doesn't exist. As soon as we get to the gate we do find out the noon flight exist -\_- The person lies to us and says it's full. Which is literally impossible (I know of 10-15 people who caught flights on other airlines). We finally find another employee off to the side at another desk who speaks English. He is able to look and says there are \*\*50\*\* people on a flight that should be nearly full. Well at that point we are mad, and also screwed because we have a bag checked for the 4:00 flight. And even though it's 11:00 they say it wouldn't be possible to have our bag moved. So our honeymoon ends spending 6+ hours in the world most annoying terminal (the PA is constantly going with announcements and it is horrible sound quality)

In the end we each ended up with a $200 voucher that we got at the check-in desk which was honestly a miracle because they were so unprepared, and a $200 email credit. Sure $400 is a lot, but not nearly enough (I think the flight should have been refunded, plus $400 in credit).

**tl;dr - Southwest stranded us in a foreign country, and had barely any processes in place to deal with it, and no English speaking employees to help a flight full of American tourist. At the time you couldn't contact SW CS from out of the country. Plane they sent to retrieve us left 1/4 full. Only offered a meh amount of compensation.**",1532641989.0

I noticed with the new reservation, you are able to change a WGA fare.  I paid with Southwest Gift cards.

Before, I believe, you could change it 1 time online, then you would lose the ability to change and would have to call in.  I believe they almost wanted you to cancel and rebook to keep flexibility.  

However, it seems like they changed this.  Are you able to update your flights as many time as you want now without losing the ability online?

So I've assumed that hotel bonus points you see also don't count.

About to go on a vacation with my wife for a week and we decided we were going to check both of our suitcases which we would easily get for free since between the 2 of us we could have 4 checked bags.

We have 1 big suitcase and 1 small suitcase total. Since we were going to be on vacation for a week we had a lot of stuff to bring. We found out once we weighed the big suitcase at the airport that it was 59lbs...9lbs overweight. The little suitcase was 31lbs...19 lbs underweight. The desk attendant wanted to charge us $75 for the big suitcase being overweight (which I understand is the charge and policy for a single bag). What I don’t get is if I get 2 bags, why I cannot use the combined weight of 100lbs instead of treating each bag as an individual? Even more weird is the fact that if I wanted to I could bring 4 total bags (since it’s 2 passengers) so my weight limit should really be 200lbs.

Losing travel credit when switching flight,1,8scr82,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/8scr82/losing_travel_credit_when_switching_flight/,3,"Hi SW folks,

I booked a SW ticket for $60 and used my travel credit of $10 (i.e. my refund from previous flight) to reduce the price down to $50. But then I had to reschedule the flight recently, and the new price is $110. I had to pay the difference, which is $60 (i.e. $110 - $50).

But that basically means my travel credit is lost. Essentially I am paying $120 of my own money for a $110 ticket, with the breakdown as follow:

$50 = Initial Fee

$10 = My travel credit (refunded from previous flight)

$60 = Fee difference

$120 = Total paid out of my pocket

As you can see, my refund is not carried over to calculate new fee, in effect sending my $10 refund into the void.

I'd previously booked legs of my trip with my wife from OKC to Detroit, then four days later on to BWI at a later date, finally home again another week later.  However a potential complication developed which could (and did) require me to travel home from directly Detroit, no second leg for me. So a week before leaving I booked a new reservation from Detroit to OKC, same as my original travel day (why new: it was ~$570 to add BWI-OKC, but ~$350 for a new booking of DTW-OKC (which had a scheduled layover at BWI, so the same flight leaving of Detroit). 24 hrs before flight time I check in, get my boarding group and save the mobile boarding passes - good to go. About 3 hrs before takeoff I just happened to check my email and noticed that they had canceled that reservation overnight.

I called SW customer service where it was explained that I had an existing reservation for the same flight and ""you can't be on the same flight twice"", so my reservation was blindly cancelled - which was not to BWI, it was to OKC, home. So I was left with no ability to get to my destination - apparently not something customer service cared about as it the above quote was repeated back to me several annoying times. After being forced to listen to the reason why (can't be on the flight twice), I was finally -allowed- to ask for a solution (my flights were re-booked at an additional cost and of course I was C## for boarding). 

While I can understand the general rationale/problem, it is just confounding that SW would cancel the reservation I'm already checked-in under, with boarding docs, that goes to a different destination - leaving the abandoned single-flight reservation that then would leave me stranded at BWI.

I flew ~80 times last year with Southwest.  Obviously, there were last minute changes and cancellations by me, which resulted in travel funds being available for use later...IF I can find them.  You are required to enter the flight confirmation number from when you originally booked the flight,  along with your name,  and the system will look it up and apply the funds if there are any for THAT confirmation number.  Repeat as necessary to find any funds. 

I sent Southwest an email asking them to provide the information to me since they don't have a method on their website to just DISPLAY them, I received this delightful, and super helpful email instead. It is obvious that the main part of the email is boilerplate template that is used quite often as I can't be the only one who finds this maddening.

Simply click on the “FLIGHT | HOTEL | CAR” link located at the top of our home page and then “Manage Reservations.” Next, select “View Travel Funds” from the options in blue and enter the required information. If you need any help, you can call us anytime at 1-800-I-FLY-SWA (1-800-435-9792).

1) Southwest terminals are similar to their planes, small seats and everything is jammed together. The Alaska terminal was very clean and the seats...the seats....were so comfy in the terminal. Thought I was in a first class lounge. 

2)The plane, a 737-900 I believe, has much more leg room than they typical Southwest plane. 

3)Every seat has its own USB/AC port so you can charge your device. Did you even know that was possible? Alaska Airlines is living like it’s 3018 up in here.  I thought only the president has this type of luxury. 

4) Free movies and texting? GTFO

5) If they offer me more than peanuts or pretzels to snack on I just might shit my pants.

"Tried Southwest over Delta, typical experience?",10,89ue35,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/89ue35/tried_southwest_over_delta_typical_experience/,8,"I'm hoping this community can provide some feedback to see if my experience with Southwest has been typical. I hear great things about the company but I've had some pretty bad experiences.

First one was connecting through Nashville. On taxi to get de-iced the pilot let us know the line to get de-iced was going to be 90 minutes. It took that long and then we had to refuel, causing a several hour delay. Ice in Nashville isn't super common but still frustrating. This delay I can understand happens, but I'm still frustrated Southwest didn't staff enough people to handle the forecast weather and flights.

The second issue was a connection through Midway. We landed and were notified all flights were cancelled due to weather. Suspiciously all other airlines were still flying with no problems. Weather was sunny with scattered clouds and about 18 degrees F. Come to find out that Southwest actually completely ran out of de-icing fluid and that grounded their flights, but they tried to blame it on weather first (conveniently an excuse that wouldn't be their fault). Thank goodness Southwest's Twitter team was on it and let everyone know what was happening.

After not being able to get through to customer service my wife and I rented the last available rental car at Midway and drove the 6 hours home instead of staying in Chicago overnight. I called Southwest the next day to see if they could reimburse the rental car and the representative said they normally do not reimburse rentals but because of the circumstances they would. I emailed receipts to a customer service email. Fast-forward six weeks and Southwest has now decided to not reimburse the rental and didn't inform me. They only told me when I called back asking for an update.

I'm definitely not happy about the lack of planning for de-icing fluid or how their customer service line handled the situation. I've been flying on Delta exclusively for 12 years for work and certainly had delays, but their customer service has always been good to work with. I think this experiment with Southwest is at an end.

Why is SW getting more expensive to fly?,6,85exwh,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/85exwh/why_is_sw_getting_more_expensive_to_fly/,10,"Live in Milwaukee. Since a local airline merged with another 8 years ago, SW was the go-to. We were going to CO once, sometimes twice, per year (MKE/DEN) and up until a couple years ago we could book flights for $70 one way. That changed last year, as we couldn't find anything cheaper than $90. This year it's even higher. During a ""sale"", which DEN is no longer a destination option when choosing MKE as the departure city (it also was not last year), the lowest I can find is *maybe* $100 because it's never really on sale anymore. However, flights typically range anywhere from $110-$130 on average for the same times, days, and months we flew in the past. What is going on? I mean we're talking an extra ~$500 total for a family of 4 from just two years ago! We have been loyal to SW and have convinced many friends and family to fly SW over the years, but now we're looking to fly another airline for vacation this year because we can't fathom paying $110 one way when someone else offers flights for $80 one way. And Chicago-Midway used to be cheaper, but on sale that also runs $100 on the low end as well out of there. Paint me disappointed.",1521442689.0

I'm currently RR at Delta AirLines (ramp agent). It's been suggested to me to go work for Southwest by a couple full-time Delta employees.

Ready Reserve means I get no benefits and there is a cap of 1400 hours per year. 

Which airline do you all think is the better employer? Southwest is like number 35 on the Forbe's list and Delta is 140-something, but I can't really find out why all that is. I did get a decent profit sharing check, and I had only worked for Delta a few months at the time (I'm still a rather new employee here).

I have a phone interview with Southwest coming up, I'm just looking for the perspective of some current SW employees.

Thanks!

——-

UPDATE:

I actually cut the phone interview short because I had decided to stay with Delta. The starting pay at Delta is two dollars more than where Southwest starts off. My main issue with Delta is lack of health benefits, but if I transfer to another position within the company (or transfer stations and pick up a full-time position on the ramp) I can easily get those. I’m not sure if I made the right decision, but I at least enjoy the people I work with right now, and that’s important. Thank you all for your input!",1520336769.0

Check out this no-reply response from Southwest,0,7mqh01,SouthwestAirlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthwestAirlines/comments/7mqh01/check_out_this_noreply_response_from_southwest/,13,"Dear Southwest,

I'm writing to complain about your policy of permitting a-list and priority passengers to cut in front of regular paying customers.  As a mom traveling with an infant under the age of two, I may not use the check-in kiosk since certificate of birth must be presented for the infant's boarding pass.  As a result, I had no choice the morning of the 20th but to wait for over an hour in the full service line, along with at least 50 other passengers in a similar situation to myself, for desk service that was repeatedly, consistently precluded by a steady stream of a-list passengers who repeatedly cut in front of us.  This was simply outrageous.  It was tantamount to no-one being available to help regular paying customers, in this case, most of whom were moms or passengers with pets.  I myself am pregnant and would preferred not to have stood for such an unreasonable length of time.  I couldn't believe that when I finally received assistance, after I had begun to make a scene, it was past boarding time and my bags were marked 'late.'  We had arrived early.  We rushed through security and I was amazed that we barely made the flight.  However, my 'late' bag did not make the flight.  In Denver, I was told it would be FedExed to me that evening.  It was not.  Nobody bothered to send it out at 5 PM that evening as promised.  It was then FedExed at 5 PM the following evening.  It was mistakenly re-routed to Memphis, I am told.  Ultiamtely, the bag did not arrive until the last day of our vacation.  As the bag contained winter clothes for my infant, our vacation was ruined as we were unable to leave the lodge.  It was far too cold for my baby to be outside without proper boots and snow clothes.  She was miserable confined to the indoors, unable to play in the snow for four of five days.  My, mom's, boots were also in the bag, which I had purchased to lessen the risk of falling while pregnant.  I was constantly on the phone and on-line trying to obtain help.  I complained to Twitter customer service, who were very unhelpful and uncaring. I told them not to send me the $150 LUV they had offered because I did not want it, and their reaction to that was to immediately send it anyway, despite my request.  I'm writing to tell you that you shouldn't obsequiously pursue wealthy fliers at the expense of regular folk, many of whom pay a lot of money for their rare vacation, don't deserve for it to be needlessly ruined. We're paying customers too who deserve much better than that.

Southwest CSR response:

Dear ****,

Thank you for taking the time to contact us. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your concerns.

We're so sorry for the stressful situation caused by long lines at our ticket counter. Currently, our Fly By Priority Lane is a benefit offered only to our A-List/A-List Preferred Members and Customers traveling on Business Select fares. I regret your disappointment that the Fly By program does not include Rapid Reward Members who have not also earned Tier status. Although we have no plans to change the criteria for eligibility, we strive to appropriately staff our ticket counter at all times. Line length can vary greatly depending on several factors (weather, holiday travel date, flight loads, etc). That said, we offer suggested airport arrival times for each airport that we serve on Southwest.com. I’m happy to pass your feedback along via our monthly summary, which is distributed to our Senior Leadership.

I regret that you were inconvenienced when your luggage did not arrive with you in Denver. I understand that your family had arrived early to check-in and were delayed by long lines, but we do ask that Customers check any luggage at least 45 minutes prior to departure for all domestic flights. According to the information in your reservation, your bag was checked in at 5:58 a.m. for your 6:30 a.m. departure. When a bag is late-checked, we should make every reasonable effort to place it on the Customer's flight; we cannot guarantee that it will travel with the Customer. Since your bag did not make the next scheduled flight, Southwest would be responsible for delivery). Additionally we are disheartened your luggage didn’t arrive until the last day of your vacation.

I apologize you found the Twitter Customer Service unhelpful and uncaring to the extent you didn’t want the $150 Southwest LUV Voucher that was sent to you. We have forwarded your correspondence to our Central Baggage Services (CBS) Department for further review. As a result, you should expect to hear from our CBS Department within 30 days. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience. If you have any questions, please contact us anytime at 1-888-202-1024.

Sincerely,

Southwest Airlines",1514533816.0

Writing this onboard a flight from Newark to Denver. I’m a typical frequent flyer, A-List Preferred, 150-175 flights per year, thinks he’s better than everyone, proudly has this all “figured out”, definitely the smartest person on the plane (just ask me), blah blah blah...

These 3 women (assholes) across the aisle from me. One gets on early using a Business Select boarding group. Because people are sheep, she miraculously manages to hold seats 6 A-C, during most of the boarding time for a full flight. Her sweaty, disheveled, ignorant and clearly hungover companions stumble on late with the C group. Just their presence was enough to piss everyone off. 

As expected, the overhead bins quickly filled up a before these two late comers waltzed in. In brilliant form, this crazy idiot proceeds to UNLOAD OTHER PASSENGERS LUGGAGE under the guise that she had been saving seats for these still-drunk-half-wits who came in late like VIPs. 

I usually keep to myself and check out, like the rest of us enduring the Greyhound bus in the sky (just a friendly jab, I love and am loyal to SWA). Maybe it was my fatigue. Perhaps my having spent a week in Manhattan, I dunno, but I snapped a little.

As the nice person sitting next to me was handed her previously stowed bag by Miss “I save seats” USA, I couldn’t help myself and decided to blurt an unfriendly, “you can’t unload another person’s bag!” Undeterred, she ignores my comment, where I added a friendly, “that’s bullshit!” which unfortunately started a small fracas in our part of the plane. 

Enter new, rookie, pacifist, “can’t we all just get along”  male flight attendant who, for reasons unexplained, sides with the three divas! The lady who was handed her bag had to let the FA take it back a few rows into an open bin. INSANE!!

It gets better. 

Just after we reach cruise, at the same time, this small league of morons all stand up and get in the aisle, waiting to use the head! ALL AT THE SAME TIME!! 

Obviously, I’ve decided to hate these brainiacs. I don’t feel guilty about it because the mouth breather closest to me decided to bust out her favorite roll-on deodorant and proceeded applying to both her forearms, 14 inches away from my face. 

Sure, I’m insensitive, but if I had a Dollar Store within driving distance of my house, I might be able to tell you what brand and scent that we’re all enjoying right now. Mhhh. So refreshing. My eyes are burning and I can’t feel my face. 

At least it’s 10 AM. Enjoy your Bloody Mary, red wine, and vodka cranberry. Oh, then enjoy your coffee with Bailey’s and ginger ale. You deserve it.

Situation: I am currently Delta Silver and by Nov 15 will be $600 shy of reaching Gold for 2020.  I can bridge the $600 but only by taking two very inconvenient flights: SAN-PDX and SAN-MIA because of timing of work meetings.  All of my flights must be paid via my corporate card, so there's no room for gaming the system (I have the Delta Gold Amex, but my spend is far shy of card spend waiver as well).

Question: Is Gold Medallion that much better than Silver?  With two little kids at home, is it worth that trade-off of time with them versus what I'll get over the course of a year with Gold status?  I expect to fly about the same amount in 2020 as I did this year, so would be on the line of achieving Gold again.  I almost feel silly for asking this, but thought it was worth input from experienced travelers.

I normally don't request Comfort+ upgrades when traveling solo because I don't want a middle seat, but when I travel with my husband it's no longer a problem.

Also, we have an international flight soon in coach. Is it correct there are no complementary upgrades on international?

Same Day Change after buying up from Main Cabin,0,dm4ml7,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dm4ml7/same_day_change_after_buying_up_from_main_cabin/,1,"I have a question regarding SDC rules for the Comfort Plus fare that would be purchased as an upgrade.

I booked travel for thanksgiving a few weeks ago as I saw fares trending upward. 

LAX-MEM redeye on 11/27 with a MEM-LAX 12/1 6:00am return. It was dumb, I should have paid more attention to my booking as I won't be staying in Memphis but driving a couple of hours away so the 12/1 6 am flight is too early and I waste that whole Sunday. If I have to keep that flight that is what I will do - its my own fault for booking such an early flight. 

But before I resign to defeat I remembered that I SDC'd on my return flight after thanksgiving last year after I had purchased a First class upgrade before check-in. I was able to leave on a flight many hours later than my original booking. I know that a first class buy up would change my fare class and give me a more favorable chance at a SDC. Unfortunately the buy up price for first on the MEM-LAX flight is currently listed at \~$450 but the Comfort Plus is only $84. If I bought the comfort plus upgrade could I use that to increase my chances of getting a SDC for later that day or night? My fear is that the Comfort Plus upgrade will still keep me lumped in my original Main Cabin fare bucket.

Sorry if this is over written. 

TL;DR - Will purchasing a Comfort Plus upgrade give me a more favorable fare class for a Same Day Change or will I retain my original Main cabin fare bucket?",1571889034.0

I'm sure they are trying to push everything to either online bookings or their own Delta Vacations.  That's a real shame because these tour operators have been the lifeblood of my business for years and now I can't work with some of the partners I've had for so long now.

However, the customer service agent's answer to me was I am only allowed 50lbs on all four planes. I thought I'd say thank you and call again, try another agent. But I got the same answer from the other agent. I then looked at Delta's baggage allowance page, [https://www.delta.com/content/www/en\_US/traveling-with-us/baggage/before-your-trip/checked.html/#DetailsRules](https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/baggage/before-your-trip/checked.html/#DetailsRules). It clearly stated that traveling from US to Asia, Premium select allow two 70lbs baggages. So I am very confused why the customer service department told me I am only allowed 50lbs and which one should I believe?",1571540362.0

For this particular trip, I really don't mind flying basic economy and booking through Expedia if it will save me over $700...but I prefer to book through Delta directly, if possible. I just want to have confidence that if I do book through Delta, I can get that price match guarantee. So I need someone here with more experience than me to either give me the confidence boost to go ahead and book with Delta (or Virgin); or someone to confirm my suspicions and to tell me to book through Expedia.",1571020052.0
Should I push for Gold or let the miles rollover for next year?,5,dh3p0s,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dh3p0s/should_i_push_for_gold_or_let_the_miles_rollover/,18,"Doing some calculations using some online calculators I believe that I will be less than 4,000 short of Gold for 2020. I have basically 100% of my flights planned for the rest of the year, but not booked yet (For work trips I'm supposed to book flights between 2-3 weeks before the trips). Would it be better for me to try and push for Gold and book another flight this year? I wouldn't have to do anything international.

* **Delta is hiring 12,000 people through the end of next year as it grows its operation.**
* **The hiring includes pilots, flight attendants and ground staff.**

[Delta Air Lines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DAL) is expanding its workforce this year and next by 12,000 as the airline expands its operations.

“We’re hiring pilots, we’re hiring flight attendants, we’re hiring ground staff. We’re hiring in all categories of the company,” CEO [Ed Bastian](https://www.cnbc.com/ed-bastian-ceo-delta-airlines/) said in an interview Thursday on CNBC’s “[Squawk Box](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/).” “We’re the process of hiring 6,000 people this year and at least a like amount next year.”

[The company’s third-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/10/delta-air-lines-dal-earnings-3q-2019.html), released before the markets opened, beat Wall Street estimates on strong demand from leisure and corporate travelers.

Delta doesn’t fly the [Boeing](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BA) 737 Max, which has been grounded since March after the second of two fatal crashes. As a result, it picked up passengers from other carriers hamstrung by the plane’s grounding. Bastian said he expects to hold onto market-share gains it made in the period.

“I do expect the share gains to be held,” he said.

The airline’s executives will hold a call to discuss the results at 10 a.m. ET.",1570872706.0

Question about flying with an Autistic child,13,dgmczv,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/dgmczv/question_about_flying_with_an_autistic_child/,21,"So we're thinking of visiting Chicago in April and it would be my son's first flight. He'll be almost 6 at the time but he's Autistic. He loves car rides so as long as there's movement he's good. We'd also bring his tablet and lots of snacks. The flight is relatively short as well.

Here's my issue:
JetBlue is usually the preferred airline option for most families with Autism. In our situation I weighed the costs vs pros/cons. My husband and I are both big - he's over 6 feet but we're also heavier. If we did JetBlue we'd have to get very specific flights so the plane was 3x2 or 3x3 so we'd be together, and Economy seats are pretty tight. 

The other option is Delta.

Delta has a Canadair Regional Jet 900 that they use for NYC to Chicago flights. In First Class that's 1x2 seats. 

Taking cost into account I realized the difference between Economy JetBlue and First Class Delta was only $150 difference! Delta would mean significantly more room, less people to possibly disturb, and a flight attendant much closer if we needed anything. I'd also inform the airline ahead of time that he has Autism.

My question is this: has anyone taken a First Class flight with a child? I know I'm paying for a service but I don't want to get nasty looks from other passengers, as that's a real issue when we're out in public. He's pretty well behaved in that it's not like we let him run around screaming and hitting people, but he could potentially get scared during takeoff and landing and he could stim at times.

Is it generally frowned upon to seat a child in First Class? 

Has anyone flown with an Autistic child on Delta? If so, how was your experience, especially if you've also flown JetBlue.",1570861812.0

1. I no longer get 'push' notifications. On my iOS device, I would always get the notifications (check-in available, bag on a plane, etc). Now on my Android device, I only get the notification if I have the app open and running in the background. I checked my notification permissions and everything is allowed. 

2. The new version 5.0 auto checks me into flights. I just opened up the app intending to check into my flight in 24 hours and it automatically did it. No acknowledging the hazardous carry-on policy, adding bags, **the option to select to upgrade to C+ aisle or window only**. None of that just took me right to a boarding pass. 

I don't really care about any of the other changes, but I really like the notifications and reminders for check-in that I am now missing and the option to choose to upgrade to C+. I have first-class selected in my global settings, but because the only time I get the aisle/window choice was during check-in I miss that too.

With the recent changes, I'm considering downgrading to Delta Platinum. I'd like some advice. I've had all the cards before except the Delta Business Platinum, so I'm doubtful any bonus would apply.

I am Diamond medallion with 100% of my flying for pleasure, most of it international. I use the MQD loophole by flying partners. I typically buy business class fares when they are cheap (usually just a little more than coach). I don't rely on the free upgrades for domestic flights. I just buy first class and pay miles until it's coach price. I haven't used the companion certificate in a few years because I typically travel solo.

I hit the $30k spend for the MQM bonus usually in the late summer. I don't ever hit the $60k mark. I might be able to get to $50k (which is the second spend bonus for the platinum), but maybe not. 

I'm disappointed that the bonus miles are now gone on the Reserve and that the Reserve doesn't earn double miles on any categories (other than Delta purchases). But I like the 15k MQMs. 

My Reserve just renewed this week. Does that mean I'm still at the old annual fee? If so, I would probably wait until next year to downgrade.

I do use SkyClubs and don't use a Diamond choice for it. I rely on my business class seat and my Reserve card since the SkyClub entry change.

* **Customers will benefit from significantly expanded travel choices across the Americas and an industry leading customer experience.**

Delta and LATAM Airlines Group S.A. (“LATAM”) today announced that they have entered into a strategic partnership that for the first time combines the strengths of the leading airlines in North and Latin America.

“This transformative partnership with LATAM will bring together our leading global brands, enabling us to provide the very best service and reliability for travelers to, from and throughout the Americas,” said Ed Bastian, Delta’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our people, customers, owners and communities will all benefit from this exciting platform for future growth.”

“This alliance with Delta strengthens our company and enhances our leadership in Latin America by providing the best connectivity through our highly complementary route networks,” said Enrique Cueto Plaza, Chief Executive Officer of LATAM. “We look forward to working alongside one of the world’s best airlines to enhance the travel experience for our passengers.”

The strategic partnership will unlock new growth opportunities, building upon Delta’s and LATAM’s global footprint and joint ventures worldwide, including Delta’s existing partnership with Aeroméxico. With their complementary networks, Delta, LATAM and their partners will be able to offer access to a greatly expanded array of worldwide destinations. Together, the partnership will provide greater customer convenience, a more seamless travel experience and better connect customers with the rest of the world.

Additional details of the partnership include:

* Delta will invest $1.9 billion for a 20 percent stake in LATAM through a public tender offer at $16 per share, to be funded principally with newly issued debt and available cash.
* Delta will also invest $350 million to support the establishment of the strategic partnership.
* Delta will acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and has agreed to assume LATAM’s commitment to purchase 10 additional A350 aircraft to be delivered beginning in 2020 through 2025, supporting Delta’s ongoing fleet transformation.
* Delta will be represented on LATAM’s Board of Directors, further strengthening the relationship.
* The tender offer and the strategic partnership are subject to customary closing conditions and all required governmental and regulatory approvals, including anti-trust immunity.

Delta expects that the transaction will be accretive to EPS over the next two years. In addition, the transaction will not impact the company’s existing financial commitments to shareholders, including free cash flow and shareholder returns. Delta also expects to remain within targeted leverage ratios.

For LATAM, the transaction will improve free cash flow generation, reduce forecasted debt by over $2 billion by 2025 and improve LATAM’s capital structure, enhancing its ability to execute its long-term strategy.

I'm a gold medallion and we got upgraded to comfort - but here's the kicker - into middle seats. 

2 things: 1. Do I call and get put back into an aisle/window (the flight right now has a ton of empty seats, with a lot of aisle/empty/window combinations available) or 2. Hang in there and hope for an upgrade to first? (and if so, when would that happen - we fly this Wed evening)

The ticket would not accrue any MQMs with a cash upgrade on a reward flight.

I've looked everywhere for this and can't find a definitive answer. It seems like I'll be just short of Platinum by the end of this year.

So on to Melbourne we went, close to our destination but not Orlando. And I get weather delays, but we were delayed because we had to wait on the gas man to come from his house to fuel the plane - he had already gone home for the night. Huge kudos to the crew - they at least told jokes and gave us tips on how to get a rental car because they knew we would be there for a while. And I did rent a car because my 2.5 hr drive got me there faster than the estimated gas man delay. And today, we had a 30 min delay leaving Orlando, no explanation aside from the assumption there was no crew because the plane was there. And normally we get delayed in Orlando because it’s constantly raining, but nothing but sunny skies today. We finally get to Atlanta, but surprise, we have another 20 min delay because no one can operate the jet bridge or door.

I think I've covered all or most of my other bases as far as the flight goes, but now I'm worried I'll need to buy a new carry-on!  I'm hoping to get other people's experiences/advice.

I recently found out that my girlfriend has been invited to be a part of her cousin's wedding on August 7th, 2020 in London, England. 

I've only flown international once but that was about 15+ years ago. I just remember that the economy seats were not very comfortable to sleep in on the long flight. Obviously Delta One is ideal, but I just can't possibly afford that cost. So I'm thinking Premium Select would be a great middle ground.

We're located in Sacramento, CA (obviously not a hub for Delta so international connecting flights from here are pricy). We can fly out of any airport in the US as my girlfriend has agreed to help with costs by using her Southwest rewards to fly us to any airport or we could drive to San Francisco as it's only about a 2 hour drive.

Would love some tips/advice for the best airport I could get a deal on flying out of on Delta's Premium Select seating in early August next year. We're pretty flexible on dates. It's almost a year away, but should we buy now or is it worth waiting to see if prices go down?

I fly roughly 6-8 times a year for business, and want to build up miles for vacation, primarily international.

That’s their issue to deal with and I don’t want to shame anyone. This is more about what’s fair to other passengers.

Friday afternoon I was returning home on a 3 and a half hour flight. I think the plane was an airbus 321 but I could be remembering wrong. I was sitting in the exit row in the seat that would normally be the middle seat, but it was the row missing the window seat with the flight attendant jump seat facing the opposite direction. These are the ones with the solid metal divider for an armrest that cannot be adjusted.

The man who sat next to me in the aisle seat was so obese that he literally spilled over the dividers into my seat. He needed a seat belt extension, but only purchased a single seat. I had to lean so far to my left that my head barely touched the head rest, and yet I was still in constant contact with him the entire duration. I’m not someone who likes to be touched by strangers but this guy seemed to have no qualms about making me miserably uncomfortable the entire flight.

As I said, this was Friday afternoon. It’s now early afternoon Sunday and I am still having shooting pains up the right side of my back, with severe stiffness in my neck and shoulder.

I don’t know if it’s worth emailing Delta about the experience, I just don’t know what to do in a situation like that when the flight attendants don’t do anything about it.

First time flyer and no nothing about anything.,0,d5biwf,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/d5biwf/first_time_flyer_and_no_nothing_about_anything/,13,"In November, I'm taking my first ever flight. I'll be alone. First I'm flying from my home state and I'll be landing in Atlanta. After that, I'll be getting on another plane to leave the country. My problem is that my layover in between flights is 1 hour and fifteen minutes. I hope that is enough time to get to the gate for my next flight. 

I also just realized I might have another problem. I'm only bringing my personal bag and a carryon bag. I read that Delta might check my carryon due to limited space on the plane. Where/How do I get my bag back when I arrive in Atlanta? Will I have enough time to get my bag and make it to my gate for my next flight? Or will Delta take my bags to the plane for me?

Who is best to help me find it? Hoping someone turned it on to delta...

Anyone know how tsa handles this? Don't have any other id with me.

**UPDATE:** As suggested, I made it through TSA with the extra pat down.  Here are details, if this happens to anyone else:
1. Do not go through Pre-check, they will turn you around at the front of the line.
2. Do go through special services line (at least in ATL)
3. They will need some alternate IDs.  Government issued is best obviously, but the suggested to me credit/debit card plus my health insurance card.
4. Got an ""escort"" through TSA line - had to take off shoes and all that.
5. Bags get searched, and you get the full pat down.

As for Delta Lost and found... The office is located next to carousel #1 in baggage claim.  They had a stack of IDs and CCs, but none were mine.  She told me the ""pickup"" from concourse D would not happen until later in the day, so no chance she would even have it yet.

I checked in on my phone, but was still advised (by Delta agents) to print a boarding pass at the kiosk, where no ID is needed.  This seems like a big loophole, but if you check in at desk they require ID.  Printed boarding pass is more helpful when dealing with the whole TSA thing.

Also, Friday precheck lines in ATL are hell-a long.  Thankfully I don't deal with that too often.",1568406345.0

Flew First Class for the First Time Today,45,d1lvb8,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/d1lvb8/flew_first_class_for_the_first_time_today/,29,"I started a new job in February where I have to fly from my home airport of GSP to BOS and back once a month, which through Delta usually necessitates a connection in ATL. Before February, I've only flown a handful of times over the years. 

My company's reimbursement policy is for ""the most economical fare class available"" and anything above that comes out of my pocket, but they do reimburse for checked bags. I started out flying Basic Economy, but after a couple of months figured out that Main Cabin was also reimbursed with no issues. 

Last month, the hotel that is recommended by my company was booked up and I found a bundle deal on Expedia for a slightly-less-fancy hotel and Comfort+ that was cheaper than just the normal rate for the recommended hotel. I did the same thing this month, but the bundle included a First Class ticket from GSP-BOS and Comfort+ on the return trip on Friday. Plus, since it was a bundle, I paid for the hotel + airfare weeks ago and have already been reimbursed by my company so there were no issues with my bundle deal making it past the bean counters.

I think I'm ruined for Main Cabin and Comfort+ now. I'm a bigger guy, and having the extra space in First Class where I never touched the person sitting next to me was by-far the best perk. Here's how I rate the rest of the experience. 

Great perks for First Class: 

* All the space. Since only two seats go into a section the width of three seats in C+ and Main Cabin, the seats are wider, there's almost a foot of armrest ""neutral ground"" between the two seats, and there was plenty of legroom. I actively avoid putting my backpack under the seat when possible because it always takes legroom away, but I don't think I would have even noticed it today. The seats also recline further, but I usually don't recline my seat so I didn't test this out.

* Free priority checked bags - I normally just bring a carry-on to avoid extra fees that I sometimes gate check, but this time I checked my carry-on and with the little yellow ""Priority"" tag on bag it was one of the first off the plane. Once I deplaned, went to the bathroom, and made it to the baggage pickup area, my bag was waiting on me. A great experience.

* Drink Service before take-off - It's awesome to get a drink before you take off. Normally, I'm used to grabbing a coffee or soda to bring onto the plane on main cabin, because it can take a while to take off and get to cruising speed, plus another 20+ min for the cart to get to my location, but in First you don't have to think about it. Just show up, board, and get whatever you want within 5-10 min. Awesome. 

* Multiple free drinks - I get a single free drink in C+, but it was nice on my flight from ATL-BOS to get a coffee w/ Baileys, a Bloody Mary, and a Bourbon and Coke Zero. 

* Drink service in first even when the rest of the plane doesn't get a drink service. The short 30-min hop from GSP to ATL never gets a drink service, but I had two coffees with Baileys in first, one pre-flight and another in the air. Awesome. 

* Free meal - I received an email a few days ago asking about my meal preference, and I chose a chicken sausage, egg, and cheese croissant. It came with a fruit plate and Chobani blueberry yogurt. It's no different than any other meal I could have gotten in the airport for $12, but I didn't have to worry about finding a meal before boarding. It was nice to just walk around during my layover without getting into long lines for food while trying to make a connection. 

* Pillow and blanket - first class domestic passengers get a little pillow and a blanket. The pillow made the already-comfortable seat even better. I didn't use the blanket, but it seemed decent. Another advantage of first class - you don't have to plan ahead to bring these things—just show up. 

* Flight Attendant attention - the flight attendant for First Class routinely checked to see if any of us needed anything. It felt like being at a nice restaurant rather than having your meal dropped off at a QSR. The attendant on both flights was also much more personable than in my previous non-FC flights.

* 150% mileage - a great bonus. I'm going to hit silver by EOY (I flew a few times on AA and United to figure out which airline to commit to), but this will help out greatly next year when I chase gold. 

Not awesome, but still nice: 

* When my boarding pass was scanned, the flight attended took the time to look at me, saying ""Enjoy your flight, Mr. <Amator>. I've never had that happen before on a flight. 

* Small water bottles waiting on the seat tray. Nice to have early in the morning when I was a bit thirsty and could have an immediate drink. 

* The armrest with built-in cup tray. It was nice to have a place for the drinks to sit without having to extend the table. 

* The table was a fold-out from the armrest and not the standard seat-back tray table. This way, I didn't have to worry about someone leaning back in their seat and spilling my drink. 

* Little niceties like ceramic cups for coffee, cloth napkins, hot towel, and a little tablecloth for the fold out table. 

* Extra pockets in the seat back - gave me a place to park my Kindle and phone while I watched IFE on these flights.

* First class lavatory - I didn't use this on either flight, but first class gets its own lav so you don't have to wait and I've heard the amenities are a bit nicer.

All in all, I feel like FC has ruined me for other seating classes. I'm going to try and book a similar package with FC flights on both legs of the trip in the future. All of the other little perks are really nice, but having the extra space is definitely the best reason for me to fly FC.",1568031064.0

My new wife and I were excited to be flying Delta Premium Select for our Honeymoon in October.  We researched all the airlines for flying into JHB and decided Delta Premium Select was our best option for comfort on a 15 hour flight.  Yesterday, Delta calls us and tells us the plane that was supposed to be taking us will no longer be ready and Delta Premium Select is not available on the replacement flight.  Delta comps us with some vouchers and miles refund, but they have moved us into the main cabin, and sat us apart from one another and the site won't let me change the seats.  I am sure we will be able to sit with one another, but this doesn't solve the main issue.  The seats.  We chose to go with Delta because of the pitch Premium Select offers.  My wife recently had back surgery and the doctor recommended the best chance for her to be without pain would be in a seat with more pitch.  

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to proceed?  Should I see if I can cancel and go with another airline?  Is there any way she could be upgraded to Delta One for this?  I would love to sit with her, but I know how difficult it would be for both of us to get into Delta One.",1567807799.0

I went to the back and told the flight attendant to please stop giving the man in 51c drinks as “it was getting bad”.

-I have a number of flights this month (1 AA domestic and 4 international) that were booked months ago, not on delta, which I’m not pleased about

I have about 90,000 miles that I could use toward probably one leg.

Am I in the wrong program?,0,cwegko,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/cwegko/am_i_in_the_wrong_program/,16,"Hello.  I'm happy to have found this subreddit!  I have a new job this year that has me traveling internationally quite a bit.  My company allows me to book business class and since January I've spent about $45K MQD and just became Diamond.  It's been 25 yrs since I was a frequent flyer and I'm awestruck at the complexity and limitations of the skymiles program.   Simple things like an upgrade certificate are NOT simple.  Regional vs continental vs domestic vs US upgrade certs.  Which fares you can and can't use them with.  When you can use them, where you are in priority queue etc. 

Beyond the complexity issue, there is fundamental value to me as a frequent flyer. As a Diamond member, I get complimentary domestic upgrades, but I don't fly domestically so this is of no value, and I get almost nothing for Global flights.  I can get 4 global upgrades which would be nice I guess to move me from Business to First on a partner carrier with a special first class(that's probably not allowed, I don't even know) but I'd like to actually use it for a global trip with my family, but that doesn't work because there are 5 of us and I'd have to buy a fare class that's 50%+ more expensive to be eligible for an upgrade and unless you book 364 days out you are unlikely to find flights with upgrade slots available?

I am flying to Europe with my wife this weekend actually.  We could have purchased ecomomy class ticket for $1100, but had to pay $1700 for a ticket that was eligible to upgrade with miles.  65K points each, each way (not including the inter Europe portion after a connection which is economy) totaling 260K miles.  I have not accumulated enough miles so far this year so we are flying home economy.  You see when you fly partner airlines you get some diminished value of points (don't ask me how this is calculated) and often if you book Delta to Seoul, for example, the fare is $6K for Korean Airlines and $8K for Delta(codeshare with Korean Air)  So the same flight is 40% more booking on Delta vs the partner airline.  I have to do the right thing for my company and book the Korean Air flight, but I get dinged on points?? 

Bottom line....My $45K MQD isnt even enough to get 2 business class upgrade to Europe.  I get no value on my global flights and I'm going to spend about $100K with Delta on flights this year and when I fly to Australia with my family next spring, I'm going to fly economy with another carrier.  I want to be loyal to a carrier!  I will pay extra to my carrier and even do stopovers to stick to a carrier, but Delta is certainly not that carrier for me!

I think maybe I'm with the wrong carrier?  I've been told that United is the better program for international travelers like myself?  I expect their program will be equally complex but hopefully that the benefits will align better with my goals for rewards and be more valuable for the type of travel I do.  I'm planning on doing the status match and moving to United starting in January.  I'd welcome your thoughts.",1566987349.0

What risk would I run by booking them separately and saving the $900?

In honor of Delta flight 975 (JFK to LAX) which was delayed 19.5 hours - What's your Delta horror story?,15,cui8hp,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/cui8hp/in_honor_of_delta_flight_975_jfk_to_lax_which_was/,14,"I'll go first to get things started.

I don't remember the flight number or the exact date, but it was in March or April of 2018. ATL to DAL. Departure time was around 1PM. The flight boarded on time and everyone took their seat, but I started to suspect something was wrong when the Flight Attendants didn't close the door. We sat there for about 45 minutes before the pilot made the announcement. ""Ladies and gentlemen, there is a large and growing pool of hydraulic fluid under this plane, and maintenance can't seem to get it fixed. I'm afraid we're going to have to find a different plane to fly to Dallas.""

Minor grumbling, but no big deal. We deboarded and stood around for awhile until the gate agent gave us our new gate. Of course this was ATL so I'm sure it was T1 to E89 or something. Eventually everyone made it over there and we boarded.

No sooner was the boarding process complete than we got another announcement from the pilot. ""This plane is in good shape and is ready to go, but there's too much fuel for our destination. We're going to have to wait a few minutes for the fuel truck to come and drain some from the tanks, and then we'll be on our way.""

That's when I knew things were going to be bad. I was watching the weather radar on the phone, and I could see the line of storms coming. Sure enough, by the time we had the right amount of fuel, pulled away from the gate and got in line, ATL was grounded due to lightning in the area.

We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours, waiting on the weather to clear. I had a window seat and had just started to see a few other planes moving when we got our third batch of bad news from the pilot. ""We're having a minor maintenance issue with an electrical component that appears to be overheating. Should be a quick fix, but we've got to go back to the terminal.""

They decided not to deboard us this time. Maintenance guys came onboard, went to the back of the plane, walked back and forth muttering. About an hour later we pulled away from the gate again, just in time for the day's second weather hold. An hour on the tarmac this time, and when we eventually turned around and headed back to the gate, there was no announcement about anything.

Turned out the pilots had timed out. They deboarded us, and we were told our new crew was inbound from MSP and would be here soon. Don't go far. I didn't go far, but I could have. It was at least 2 hours before the new crew showed up and we got back onboard the plane.

The first announcement from the new crew was the one that almost started the mutiny. ""Unfortunately it looks like all this idling has used up a lot of fuel, and we don't have enough now for our route to Dallas. It will just be a few minutes until the fuel truck arrives to give us some gas.""

We *finally* took off for DAL at 2AM, roughly 13 hours after our original departure time.",1566615460.0

Future of Delta SkyClub,3,cufbxy,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/cufbxy/future_of_delta_skyclub/,15,"While Delta has certainly worked to improve its onboard hard and soft product (joining its all-around fantastic customer service), one area that it is certainly lacking compared to United and American is its SkyClubs.  Don't get me wrong: I love the breadth of airports covered by SkyClubs, and many of the newly renovated clubs are amazing (Seattle Main, San Francisco, JFK T4, Atlanta E and F, Austin, etc.).  It's also important to note that Delta is in the midst of upgrading/renovating many of its lounges (O'Hare, Detroit, etc.) over the coming years.  However, even with modern designs, higher quality food options in some of its clubs (Seattle, Boston, Austin), expanded shower suites, new outdoor cabanas, and more fully-stocked bars (all of which put the new suite of SkyClubs above most Admiral Clubs and United Clubs, at least in my opinion), Delta lacks a truly premium-level club to rival the likes of American Flagship/Flagship Dining and United Polaris.

It is un-refundable but right now it says they will charge me 150 EUR per ticket to cancel, which is fine.

We are waiting for some paperwork to go through before we can move to the US and there's a small chance it may happen by December, in which case we could just take the original flight without cancelling.

So, my question is, if we wait until like November (1 month before the flight) will the cancellation fee still only be 150 EUR? Or could it go up?

Also, I've been looking at changing to a one-way January flight, but January prices are 4000 for 2 people for a return, and 6000 (!!!) for one-way for 2 people. Flying from Frankfurt to Atlanta. Since the return ticket is cheaper than the one-way, is it fine to get the return and simply not fly back? I've heard of people getting in trouble for this before.

What airport do you dread/love?,18,cqnnc7,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/cqnnc7/what_airport_do_you_dreadlove/,60,"The airport I absolutely despise is BOS. There’s honestly nothing good I can say about this airport, and now that Delta has expanded flights here, it’s gotten even worse. The bag drop lines are insane, this is the only airport where I can honestly say I find staff to be in general just straight up rude, the ones who aren’t blatantly rude, seem visibly stressed to their limit.   Even beyond Delta, the gate areas are crowded, with not even remotely enough seating, food choices are terrible, you’ve got a Dunkin’ Donuts, a Starbucks that can’t get an order right to save their life, A Friendly’s that always runs out of food, The only remaining choices are a few angrily staffed quick service places with limited menus. Now that Delta has control of terminal A, and will begin taking over all gates, I can only hope that they push for some drastic improvements to the terminal.  

My favorite airport is MSP. Albeit in the F gates it can get crowded, at least you can get from terminal to terminal without leaving security, there’s plenty of food choices both sit down and fast food. There’s plenty of shops to kill time in, and in the shitty event you have to sleep there, there’s plenty of quiet open space around the C/G bridge or in the A corridors, if you end up doing an overnighter on the floor. The counter and bag lines usually move at a somewhat reasonable pace. The Sky Club is always clean and well stocked. The staff at MSP just seems to give a shit. 

Honorable/dishonorable mentions: 

ATL- the mothership, plenty of food/space/flights, but can be overwhelming. 

MCO - Old and outdated, frustrating TSA. 

LAS - Spacious, clean, good food, and hey, it’s Vegas. (Occasionally long TSA) 

SEA - TSA is a total clusterfuck. Food choices are mediocre in delta area.

Background: I work for an organization with a lot of travelers, almost all of whom use Southwest.  They’re all convinced SWA is cheaper, and no amount of me pointing out that the reason our expense managers let me fly Delta is because the cost is comparable will convince them.  I get tons of smug comments about how much they love not paying for bags (we all fly enough to easily make Sky Priority, but whatever...) and how flying nonstop is so great (yeah, whatever...good luck flying to secondary markets period on SWA). 

Anyway, two of my colleagues and I were all in the NYC metro area on Wednesday when a big storm hit.  I sat at the gate at EWR, and after about half an hour of rolling delays, my flight was cancelled.  I approached the desk at the gate, and the gate agent was extremely apologetic, totally sympathized with my wanting to get home ASAP, and really seemed personally sorry that the best he could do was to get me on a flight the next morning.  In first class.

Meanwhile, Southwest loaded my colleagues onto their plane, kept them onboard throughout a three hour delay, then brought them back to the gate and cancelled the flight.  According to my colleagues, the SWA gate agents couldn’t do anything to help them rebook (“you have to call the 800 number”) and didn’t act like they cared at all.  My colleagues ended up being rebooked onto a flight Friday evening, so they should be arriving right about now...36 hours after I got home.

I know each situation is different, but the professionalism and level of care that Delta showed in this situation is another small example of why I’m loyal to them.",1565437558.0

I said whatever, waitlist is fine, hoping that it would clear ahead of my flight tomorrow. 

I check this morning before check-in begins and the upgrade  list is pretty long already with all the medallions connecting through the first leg of my trip. Upon check in, I show up on the c+ upgrade list, but I'm absent from the first class upgrade list.  

I called to check in on the status of the upgrade certificate after checking in and seeing this, and they assured me there were no seats, but if there were then I'd be on the list. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Could there have been an issue with the way they agent applied the RUC? Looking for any advice from any veteran medallion members as this is my first year with status and only second time using an RUC.

Delta's policy for cancelling flights free of charge is that it is free within 24 hours of purchase. However, if you actually read the policy on their [site it specifically states](https://www.delta.com/us/en/change-cancel/cancel-flight/#24hour):

""Cancellation request must be made by midnight of the day after the eTicket is purchased or midnight of the departure date of the first flight, whichever comes first.""


&nbsp;


For example, one time I bought a ticket through Delta, and purchased it around 09:00 on a Wednesday. If I had 24 hours to cancel, I would have to cancel by 09:00 on Thursday, makes sense, right? However, because of this policy, I technically would have until midnight on Thursday to cancel. What happened was that on Thursday, one of my friends bought a different flight at like 13:00, so I wanted to cancel my flight. I thought it was too late since it had been 24+ hours, but then I found this fine print and discovered I could technically cancel until midnight that day, which I did without issue. I ended up figuring this out and canceling at like 21:00 for free with no issues, 36 hours after I initially bought. 

&nbsp;

My current situation is the ultimate stretch of that situation. I purchased a ticket last Thursday.. night. I technically bought the ticket at 00:45, which should be Friday. However, my ticket shows the date of purchase as Thursday, even though it was technically purchased on a Friday. Lo and behold, today, Saturday, the other airlines drop their prices by like $250, and I really wanna cancel now. I'm in a grey area, though. What is different about my situation now than the time I bought at 9 AM and canceled 36 hours later with no fees? If my 01:00 flight counts as being bought on Thursday, then per the policy, I could only cancel until midnight on Friday, giving me 23 hours to cancel, which is fucked. 

&nbsp;

I think that it would be kinda ridiculous for the policy to stretch out this far. Except what bothers me is that if I only have until midnight of the next day, and I bought my ticket at 1:00 AM on Friday, but the system thinks I bought it on Thursday, then I would only have 23 hours to cancel. What if I bought at 2:00 AM? 3:00? When does the line get drawn? Clearly 9:00 AM was on the other side of the line, but if 2:00 AM still counts as the day before, that's even less, 22 hours to cancel. If 3:00 AM is the day before, even more fucked. I'm on hold with customer service to ask, but I don't think the rep will even know the answer let alone understand what I'm asking since it's hard to explain. Anyone know from experience?



&nbsp;

Edit:

update, their system had my ticket as still available for risk-free cancellation. Props to Delta. I guess I could have ridden this until midnight tonight lol and done the ultimate 46 hours free cancellation move. I guess a new travel hack could be always book after midnight?",1565473296.0

Better together: Delta twins share their experiences on National Twin Day,9,cm9t1z,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/cm9t1z/better_together_delta_twins_share_their/,1," **​In honor of National Twin Day, Aug. 3, Delta celebrates wombmates who work side by side and bring their shared uniqueness to the airline and customers every day.**

If you peeked into the cockpit of Delta Flight 466 from New York's JFK airport to Tel Aviv, you may have thought you were seeing double.

John and Tony Vivinetto, identical twins and New York-based Airbus A330 captains, were just as surprised as the rest of their crew that it took nearly three decades for the pair to fly a jet together.

 

""During the pre-flight crew briefing, everyone had some funny looks on their faces,"" said John. ""It's something we've been dealing with our whole lives.""

Renata and Roxanna Reid know the feeling. Each works in a different Delta Sky Club at JFK.

""Sometimes people walk in not paying much attention, but it's usually when they go from one club to the other that they give us an odd look,"" said Roxanna. ""We know they're wondering how we got there so fast.""

The Reid sisters have stuck together throughout their lives— even getting hired by Delta on the same day–which could prompt questions in an industry where seniority is currency when flying standby and bidding for shifts. ""I'm senior to her because I'm five minutes older,"" quipped Renata.

Twins Andrea Nabors and Undrea Mathis have also pursued a parallel career path working in close proximity in Delta's Reservations & Customer Care during their 19-year tenure with Delta.

""We had never sought out to work together, it just happened that way and it's been really great,"" said Andrea.

Hired just six months apart, they worked on the same team, assisting customers over the phone. ""I worked in the daytime, she was on overnight. Needless to say, people were always confused,"" said Undrea.",1565033482.0

I am loyal Delta customer that had a hellish experience two weeks ago.  We almost missed our vacation because of Delta.  We were delayed getting from Tampa to Omaha (through Detroit), spend the night on the floor of the Detroit airport… and we actually never made it to Omaha, as we were sent to Des Moines instead.

When our flight from Detroit to Omaha was cancelled, Delta placed us on a flight to Des Moines instead. We were told all of the possible Omaha flights that day and the next day were full. The Des Moines flight kept getting delayed, then ultimately cancelled, leaving us to sleep on the floor of the airport. 

At one point the Des Moines flight was getting ready to board (the flight attendant announced that they had a crew member on their way to the gate and we would board as soon as they arrived), so we booked a hotel online for $145 to stay in Des Moines.  Despite this announcement, the flight was postponed until the following morning, then cancelled. We (barely) slept on the floor of the Detroit airport, and lost the money spend on the hotel room. The delays were not all weather related, as we were told it had to do with a lack of crew and also a mechanical issue. 

Once we did arrive in Des Moines the following day, we had to take a $157 Uber ride from Des Moines to Omaha to get to our destination. 

We were originally scheduled to arrive in Omaha by Friday at 12pm. We arrived in Omaha at 2:30pm on Saturday, sleep deprived from the ordeal.

I am a very loyal Delta customer, an Amex Platinum Delta Sky Miles member and a Silver Medallion member. During this ordeal, myself and my wife were treated terribly. The experience has shaken my faith in quality of Delta’s customer service. I understand that weather was the original catalyst for the delay.  However, Delta treated us horribly.  Some examples:

1. While we were waiting for our Des Moines flight, we heard that a flight to Omaha (transporting Bernie Sanders of all people) was added last minute and went out that night. We were never informed that the flight existed and could have been an option for us (or it may have opened up spots on other Omaha flights).

2. We slept on the floor in the Detroit airport. We were told that there were no hotel options. Delta promised us blankets and pillows.  It took the staff over 2 1/2 hours to deliver them. They were delivered at 2:30am.  We were in a freezing airport, without most of our personal belongings, trying to sleep on the floor for hours until they arrived.

3. I did not sleep much that night anyway, as I stood in line three different times to speak with 3 different agents. I was concerned that our baggage would not follow us to Des Moines and would be left in Detroit. I was worried because the track my bags feature on the Delta app still showed them on the plane from Tampa.  I was assured that the baggage would follow us.  When I arrived at Des Moines our baggage did not, despite my best effort to raise this concern and head off the issue. The people at the Des Moines baggage office were able to get the bags rerouted to Omaha, but only because I refused to leave until they spoke with someone in Detroit. 

We were flying to Omaha to participate in RAGBRAI, a week-long bike ride across Iowa. All of our biking and camping gear was in our luggage. We spent a lot of money to do the ride, which also consumed a lot of our vacation days.  If we did not get to camp with our luggage by Saturday evening, our charter would have left without us. We would have no reasonable way to catch up to them once the ride across Iowa began. We barely made it to camp, and had to take the bus the first day as we were too physically exhausted to ride our bikes.

When I inquired why this was I was told they only offer expanded drink and snack menus on flights over 950 miles. Is this new? This is the first time this has occurred and I've flown many other trips in the 700-800 mile range before.

Also I'm confused about miles earned. I understand it is by fare class paid and not trip distance but even that doesn't seem to make sense.
On most trips the base miles number is the distance of each leg. Atl was 730, mco 850, etc. But for yul it shows base miles of 1350 for each leg instead of 350 like I would have expected. Why is this?

Delta flight attendant broke my laptop. Will they actually reimburse me?,4,ck9o34,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/ck9o34/delta_flight_attendant_broke_my_laptop_will_they/,5," 

I flew on Delta last week. The attendant wanted me to put my backpack in the overhead bin. I was in the window seat with a person already sitting next to me so she grabbed my backpack (specifically for laptops), and was shoving it into the overhead bin really hard. I expressed to her I had two laptops in there - my company laptop and my own Chromebook. She said it would be fine and I assumed she was right because this is her job and she does this on a daily basis. Well, the next day, I went to use my computer at work and the screen was damaged. It turns on and you can see it but barely, it is extremely dark. If I use my phone flashlight, I can see it but I truly thought it was done because the screen looks black.

I tweeted my issue, Delta reached out and got my flight info. Today, they called me with a case number and wants it taken somewhere to see what the specific damage is and an estimate. My company simply had me buy a monitor and HMDI cord and connect it to my laptop so I'm using that now while in GA and our home office is in KCMO, where our own company will access the damage.

Is it Possible to Extend an E-Cert Voucher by Purchasing Refundable Ticket and Later Changing it?,4,ck9uvi,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/ck9uvi/is_it_possible_to_extend_an_ecert_voucher_by/,5,"Hey all, I have a question regarding an expiring e-cert voucher for around $200 that I would love to be able to use. The situation is as follows:

I was issued a $200 e-cert around a year ago because Delta did not honor the seats I paid to select and separated my fiance and I on a flight right after we got engaged. My voucher has a book-by date of 8/1/2019 (2 days from now) and my now-wife and I do not have any travel opportunities that have materialized. Her family is hoping to do a ski trip this winter with us out west, but the dates have not been agreed upon yet. We would love to use our voucher for that, but this is not possible right now because the specifics have not been gone over and whether or not it will happen at all is still up in the air.

My idea to circumvent this is to purchase any old fully refundable fare from my origin airport (MSP) for 6+ months out, and when we finally figure out any travel plans we actually want, to do a ""Change Reservation"" on the website since it will be at no charge according to the fully refundable fare stipulations. I have seen people post about successfully doing this on flyertalk but the most recent example of someone doing it I found was 2015. Does anyone know if this method would work? Has Delta plugged this hole in holding over voucher value for longer than they intend?

Though Delta's terms say otherwise, this is US law. So when I booked a flight for the wrong date, and Delta's service told me that I couldn't change it 3 hours later, I put up a fight on the phone for over an hour. Eventually they transferred me to a ""supervisor"" who managed to get me an American Airlines flight and told me that I'll be ""refunded"" my $143 for a different flight. What he didn't tell me, is that I'll also be given a $200 fee (ironically I would have saved $57 just purchasing both flights).

He sent me an email to confirm this transaction, without a breakdown of fees involved with it. I later realized that the flight was so expensive because of the $200 fee, so I contacted Delta's customer service on Facebook about this. They have no recollection of this transaction, and claims that they can't make American Airlines purchases from Delta and that I must've dealt with a 3rd party instead (super sketchy).

Delta Vacations and Award Tickets?,2,charoi,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/charoi/delta_vacations_and_award_tickets/,4,"Hi everyone,

Getting married in September and our first two honeymoon plans have fallen through (first place burnt to the ground, second place is in the Dominican...). Anyways, we have been working with a travel agent but she has been less than responsive lately so I'm thinking about taking this into my own hands. I have about 170k SkyMiles that our travel agent said could be used for an award ticket in conjunction with the Delta Vacations packages. However, when I try and do this myself my only option to use miles is the flat 1 mile = $.01 redemption rate, rather than the ability to purchase an award ticket.

Delta says the next big battle between airlines will take place on the ground,15,cgf5zw,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/cgf5zw/delta_says_the_next_big_battle_between_airlines/,7,"* **Recent profits and a strong U.S. economy are giving airlines the opportunity to invest more in the airport experience.**
* **Many airports are setting new monthly passenger records.**
* **Delta thinks it can get a leg up on the competition as the edge on fares and in-cabin services becomes more limited.**

&#x200B;

 [*https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/21/delta-says-next-big-battle-between-airlines-will-be-on-the-ground.html*](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/21/delta-says-next-big-battle-between-airlines-will-be-on-the-ground.html) 

 

The airline industry is experiencing strong financial performance — [Delta Air Lines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=DAL) recently hit a record stock price, and [United Airline Holdings](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=UAL) grew profits in its latest earnings as the U.S. economy continues its decade-long run.

In fact, airline industry conditions are so good, longtime airline-stock hater Warren Buffett of [Berkshire Hathaway](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BRK.A) became one of the sector’s biggest investors in recent years after a wave of consolidation brought the fleets closer to the almost monopoly conditions he looks for in businesses.

But other recent highs in air travel are not so positive: Airports all over the country are setting new records in monthly passenger levels, making the airport experience one of the worst “legs” in a traveler’s journey. As a result, major airlines flush with money for reinvestment are making the on-the-ground experience a greater focus of their efforts to out-compete rival carriers.

“I think the next area of competition in air travel is in the airport,” Paul Jacobson, executive vice president and CFO of Delta said at the [CNBC @Work Human Capital + Finance conference](https://www.cnbc.com/work/) in Chicago last Tuesday. “How do you continue to streamline the on-the-ground experience. It is a big part of how passengers rate the experience.”

In major metro areas the two biggest issues in airport satisfaction are access to the airport (with so many major airports far from city centers) and the terminal itself, at No. 1, according to J.D. Power.

“The most common PR headline from any airport any month is ‘X airport sets new monthly passenger record,’” said Mike Taylor, J.D. Power’s travel practice leader.

But that does not necessarily mean it is good PR with so many airports so dated.

 

There are some aspects of the airport experience that airlines can’t do anything about. Only 6% more airports have been built in the U.S. since 1980, despite 181% more domestic passengers.

“They can’t build another four-lane highway to the airport,” Taylor said. “Most of the airports are shoehorned into areas never meant to handle this much traffic.”

Those problems don’t end once at the airport, either: Many parking lots closest to terminals at some of the busiest U.S. airports are now completely full and closed on multiple days per week. This is the type of on-the-ground frustration that leads to missed flights, and missed flights lead to the blame being placed all around.

“People are more stressed on the airport and airlines side of things, and they blame both,” Taylor said.

For the airlines like Delta, it does not matter that some of the terminal experience is beyond their control. Taylor said that when an aircraft closes and sits on the ground because the FAA is holding them there, passengers do not complain about the FAA. “They paid the airline, and they pick up the cocktail napkin and swear at it.”

Scott Mayerowitz, executive editorial director of travel information site The Points Guy, said the airport experience is unique in the travel journey as being so bad, and it is an important part of the journey that is underexamined. “Until my head hits the pillow in a hotel room, I am on the go, and it all matters,” Mayerowitz said.

Delta is collecting as much data as it can from passengers to improve the travel experience. [“We survey everything,”](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/whats-the-most-stressful-part-of-your-trip-delta-wants-to-know.html) Jacobson told those attending the CNBC event in Chicago. “A lot of that comes down to the psychology of the customer and understanding what each leg in the journey makes the customer feel like.”

## Wall Street is watching

Wall Street is focusing more on the airport experience in its analysis of airline stocks. Hunter Keay, a Wolfe Research analyst who covers Delta, wrote that the Delta CFO is correct in his focus on the airport as a competitive key. Keay wrote in a late 2018 research note that Delta’s major investment in “investment-starved airports” like New York City’s LaGuardia “are not so much an act of generosity but a strategic decision that we believe will further widen DAL’s competitive advantage to peers by driving up costs for marginal competitors there that lack scale, pricing power, or both. ... This is literally a 20-year competitive advantage DAL is building today, arguably the hardest one yet for competitors to copy.”

Delta is investing $12 billion over a five-year period investing in its airport infrastructure, primarily at New York City’s LaGuardia, Los Angeles International, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Salt Lake City International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

“Airports have always been a challenge for airlines who haven’t been able to crack that code due to more pressing capital needs internally, fear of committing to longer-term, big dollar projects due to business cycle risk with questionable balance sheets, or the challenges of driving buy-in or consensus with the government agencies that run these airports. But it seems to us that DAL is figuring this thing out,” Keay wrote.

One of the terminal chokepoints where Delta made an investment is through a stake it owns in biometric screening company Clear. Jacobson pointed to the Clear investment as part of its efforts to streamline the passenger experience through investments in technology. “We’ve made big bets in technology in the past few years thinking we can turn it around into revenue generation,” the Delta CFO said at the CNBC event. Jacobson said technology like Clear should ultimately improve the experience beyond the security checkpoint.

“I think ultimately the technology around identification, whether facial recognition or fingerprints, is coming to all transactions,” Jacobson said.

“Delta has recognized that security is a horrible headache for people,” Mayerowitz said. “[Clear is at many more airports](https://www.clearme.com/where-we-are/?p=GOOGBRAEX&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwmtDpBRAQEiwAC6lm4_5SRPJeH1iXNFpzLmr3hK4Db775gDPmp55sLlbhgVcATBnYKT0vjxoCr-EQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) than before because of the Delta investment, and they’ve done saturation at their key hubs. ”

Mayerowitz, who is a Clear member, added, “In two to three minutes at LGA or JFK, I can make it from the curb to the other side of security. Clear gets me to the front of the precheck line, and I just put my bag in and walk through and I’m done.”

## The timing is right for airlines

A focus on future revenue is one of the reasons why Delta is making the investments now, before a recession hits and operating conditions weaken.

Yael Taqqu, a senior partner at management consultant McKinsey, who spoke on a panel with Jacobson at CNBC’s @Work Human Capital + Finance conference, said investments like the ones Delta is making now are designed to be “revenue enhancements” out ahead of the next downturn. “In a downturn, the wedge between digital haves and have nots, which is already wide, will get wider,” said Taqqu.

Taylor said the timing is right from an airline industry perspective too. “You have to have three things happen to really expand airports. The economy has to be good, the airline has to be making money, and policies have to be right. These days, we have all three of them working in the airlines favor. ... When they are not making money, those things get put on hold. They would like to have everything set up for the passenger to be happy before getting on the craft.”

Airlines also are running out of ways to improve and “disaggregate” — price-tier — the in-cabin experience.

“Right now airlines have healthy profits and are reinvesting,” Mayerowitz said. “Delta likes to brag that they have the most inflight seatback TVs of any airline, and they’ve built a business around what they say is a superior product in the sky, and it commands a revenue premium, people willing to spend $10-$15 extra. But at the end of the day, there is only so much you can do to increase costs in the sky.” He added of Delta’s focus on the terminal, “They are right, especially as airlines cram more seats into planes and come up with hideous slim-line bathrooms just so they can get an extra row of seats in.”

Delta is among the airlines that have cut down bathroom size in some cabins to add an extra back row.

Some of the on-the-ground improvements won’t be available to all passengers — in fact, they are designed to find ways within the terminal to extract greater revenue and reward elite levels of passengers.

“Space dedicated to lounges will continue to grow,” Taylor said. “They are looking for more space in which to hand out perks and do the same thing as they are doing in the cabin ... and trying to monetize some of it.”

Mayerowitz, who holds 19 credit cards offering access to many different terminal lounges, said that frequent flyers need better club options because classic lounges at big city terminals can often be “packed.”

Lounge investment is not limited to the airlines. [American Express](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AXP) has its own series of luxury lounges for elite car holders, the Centurion Lounge. “Centurion has really upped the game in design and food offering,” Mayerowitz said.

Airlines including American Airlines and United (Polaris Lounge) have added multiple-tiers of lounges in addition to the classic options (e.g. AA’s Admirals Club).

“The lounge is crowded for most of these airlines and they are trying to differentiate it. ... If you’re paying $10,000 for a one-way flight, you better be getting something better than a $450 traveler on the same trip. That’s why they have separate entrances for check in,” Mayerowitz said. He added that international travel already features some of these perks, but a passenger flying domestic will has not historically seen this level of service except to limited cross-country routes.

Luxury perks also have extended to travel between terminals. United offers Mercedes Benz cars for elite passengers that need to transfer between terminals for ground connections, a perk that Mayerowitz says can make quite an impression. “Elite members are whisked in these luxury cars around big planes to their next flights.”

Delta offers Porsches; [American Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAL) uses Cadillacs.

All the airlines will spend “multi billions of dollars,” in all, Taylor said.

Better food offerings and private dining on demand for top-tier travelers is coming. “Why have cheese cubes and crackers at the lounge when you can pay for fresh made?” Mayerowitz said. His credit card collections makes sure he always has options and he is seeing more of the benefits as lounges improve.

“I was just in Las Vegas and went to a lounge, got in thanks to my Chase Sapphire Reserve card, and it was great. Nice views and good snacks and a perfect place to unwind before heading out on the next part of my journey.”

But there are limits to how far the airport improvement era can take the passenger.

Mayerowitz is not getting his hopes up too much. “Airports are just pretty bus terminals. There is only so much you can do.”",1563840573.0

I need to fly out of DC, DCA is most convenient due its proximity to Union Station (I live in Charlottesville, VA and am taking an Amtrak to/from the airport). I'm in a bit of a conundrum and thought I'd ask people who might travel internationally more than me.

My options on the return (for the lowest cost possible) are through JFK, 1hr 48 min layover OR a 7 hr layover. The 7 hr is really not what I want because it puts me in DC late at night and I'm trying to Amtrak home. Basically I'd be stuck overnight. I could also fly trough Paris with a short connection to IAD, but this puts me a long way away from Amtrak stations.

The 1hour 48 layover puts me in DC two hours before the last train goes to Cville. I'd be home in time for late dinner.

I have Global Entry and Silver Medallion status. I'll be traveling alone, and I have to check a bag, but I will only have a personal item other than that (probably a backpack so I can move fast). My concern is the JFK website says I'll have to get my bag and recheck it. I do travel a lot just not internationally so I know how to hustle through an airport. So my questions:

1. Will I have to go through security again?
2. Does it seem possible to get through global entry customs and make the flight to DC with a <2h connection?
3. If I miss my connection will they fly me standby or try to confirm a seat right away, since they sold me the shit connection?

I waited at baggage claim after we landed. Both my coworkers got their bags, I did not. 

I went to the Delta baggage office to file a claim and they made some calls. They couldn’t figure out why it didn’t make it on the original flight, but said it would make it on the next flight and delivered to my hotel that night.  

Well, my bag did not show up at my hotel. I called and spoke with a Delta representative and she informed me my bag went from MSP to BNA to ATL and wouldn’t be to PHL until 8am the next morning. At that point it doesn’t even matter as my return flight departed PHL at 2:40pm today. I got to the airport, grabbed my bag in the claims office, went through security and boarded my flight home with my unopened bag! 

I didn’t make a big fuss about the lost bag as the Delta people I was interacting with weren’t at fault. However, it was inconvenient to not have my “stuff” for a work trip and wear the same clothes two days in a row.  I feel like I should be entitled to more than the 20 minute baggage delay/2500 miles deal. Would love to know what the experts here think.

When we went to bag drop, the person helping us noticed and printed us out a new boarding pass and assigned us seats there so we didn't have to wait to get assigned at gate!

Hey all!

Not sure if anyone will have any answers because my situation is very specific but it's worth a shot.

I am a Delta AMEX member who bought BE tickets as it was significantly cheaper. We've bought them before and not had a problem because we usually purchase our seats the week before for a little extra (still cheaper for us)

On the way to Zurich from JFK, we booked our seats for the extra fee. We were fine and still zone 1 but I noticed the gate agent told everyone who did not have seats to board in Zone 3 and they will get their seat assignment.

We were scheduled to fly back Thursday from MXP, purchased our seats again and all good. Today we got an email from delta stating that due to expected weather in NYC Thursday they were offering a free change of flight or refund if we wanted or we could wait. We need to be home so we called and changed for tomorrow. 

The representative said we couldn't use our prepurchased seats so they refunded me. That's fine.

My concern is on our boarding passes, we don't have a zone or a seat. I don't want to board with zone 3, as we each have a carry-on and need space. 

Has anyone experienced the gate agent just telling passgeners with no seat assignment to just board in Zone 3 or was that a isolated incident due to us being late anyway.

Thanks in advance! I'm heading to the airport in 5 hours anyway but just would like to calm some nerves :)",1562742005.0

I understand I would need to purchase that seat, and I am more than willing to do so, I just don’t know if they will allow it. I am diamond, and a million miler, so delta has bent a rule or two for me in the past when I was in a pinch… However I know flying with animals is a very sensitive topic these days, and a lot of the rules are nonnegotiable. 

There are several non-stops a day from RDU to BOS, and it is not a long flight, I would also see if I could get her veterinarian to give the dog a mild sedative, just in case. I would rather not drive, but if I have to, I have to.

If anyone has any insight, I would appreciate it greatly.",1562273782.0

Thankful Delta seemed to genuinely care,28,c8jtl2,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/c8jtl2/thankful_delta_seemed_to_genuinely_care/,3,"So,  based out of Atlanta, but I was in Sacramento for business and had to travel to Phoenix (through LAX). All of my colleagues chose the SWA direct flight rather than having a connection. Well I am chasing platinum and not just gold this year, so it’s worth it right? and I had been upgraded on both segments, so even more reason to stick with it.

Well, after a several hour delay in Sacramento, it was obvious I was going to miss the connection in LAX, which was the last flight of the day. If I took the first flight the next day from LA, was still going to miss my meeting.  The gold desk didn’t have any help for me other than to try and make it to LA and then reassess. If i was going to miss the meeting, might as well go back to ATL. The gate agent was sympathetic.

She worked with American to get my on its nonstop. The AA flight was also delayed, so i could make it, but because it was delayed it was showing as unavailable (already departed in Delta system).  She transferred me to AA for next morning first flight, and then worked with AA gate agent to move the trip up to it’s delayed flight.  This was dreamwork. Unfortunately, the ticket was stuck in limbo out of the Delta system, but not yet showing up in the AA system. The AA flight had to shut its door before the ticket came through. Missed the flight. Disappointing, but I feel like both airlines genuinely tried, just not enough minutes. 

They had to issue my ticket back to Delta. The gold desk was going to send me to LAX to try and go standby to ATL. The gate agent locally was able to confirm me in first class for a direct flight (the red eye) from Sacramento to ATL. Again, disappointed in the delay and missing my meeting, but genuinely feel like the local gate agent went above and beyond to try and resolve my issue; and when it didn’t work out, treated me right with a resolution the was the best scenario for a crappy situation.  Shout out to Lynda in Sacramento. 

Delays will strike anywhere - pleased to have a decent solution on Delta this time. Perhaps a few MQMs and segments than I intended, and a meeting short, but at least I’m getting out of here and not stuck until tomorrow.

* **New service begins in November for flights 6.5 hours or longer**
* **Elements include signature cocktail, tray table place mat**

&#x200B;

As airlines boost profits by packing more passengers into smaller spaces, lengthy international trips have become increasingly cramped and miserable. Delta Air Lines Inc. hopes a refreshing drink and a nicer dinner setting will help make up for all that.

Starting Nov. 5 in the coach class cabin of international trips of more than 6.5 hours, the Atlanta-based carrier will start off each flight offering coach passengers a free peach and sparkling wine cocktail or bottled water, a hot towel for freshening up and an updated menu for on-board meals. Food will be served on a small platter instead of a traditional tray, with a place mat. Dessert and coffee will be served separately “We’re providing choices with elements of service to distract people from feeling like they’re stuck in a metal tube for 10 hours,” said Jaime Jewell, director for inflight brand strategy and customer experience. “It’s really about trying to take the airplane out of the experience a little bit.”

Flight attendants, some of whom helped design the new service, will be chattier and engage more with passengers, she said. The service was tested on more than 700 Delta flights between Portland and Tokyo over the past year.

Delta declined to say how much it spent developing the new service.",1562107938.0

I'm an inexperienced flyer and this is my first trip on an airplane. I have a second item that is fragile, containing a plastic prop cane and a long cosplay staff that is about 62 inches long and definitely will not fit in the overhead. Do I need to pack it as a checked bag, and if so how do I set about doing that? Can I bind it to my checked luggage as one bag, or do they need to be separate items? Can I bring it as carry-on instead as long as it a) lies flat on the floor or against a wall in the cabin, and b) does not obstruct anyone's view of exit signs, etc.? Very confused as the website does not seem to explain this well.  


TSA has told me it is okay to have these items as long as they are checked luggage. Should I mark the items as cosplay props so TSA does not mistake them for something dangerous? I would rather not have these items broken and I am paranoid I may get held up having to deal with more baggage fees.

Delta/Air France MIA/CDG,0,c5c6ss,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/c5c6ss/deltaair_france_miacdg/,3,"A couple of questions about booking through delta.com versus booking directly through AIr France. Being a million miler with DL I always book through and fly DL only. I do not have an account with AirFrance nor do I necessarily want to establish one. I’m flying AirFrance in order to cross the Airbus A380 off my bucket list. Questions as follows: At what point during my delta.com booking will I be able to get my seating on Air France? Regular Economy over to CDG and premium Economy back to Miami. DL reservations told me that after booking on delta.com I would then have to go the AirFrance website, enter my booking number at which point I can request my seating. Sounds a little vague to me.
Also, has anyone flown AirFrance premium economy on a North Atlantic route? Will AirFrance honor my Delta elite level with regards to checking/boarding/baggage?",1561513248.0
Delayed baggage question JFK->TXL,0,c5a02i,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/c5a02i/delayed_baggage_question_jfktxl/,1,"Hi, 

I checked two baggages on my one way flight on july 23 from JFK->TXL, one bag and one bicycle (disassembled, in a soft case).  The bicycle was expedited, supposedly, on a KMS JFK->AMS flight and was set to be on a subsequent KMS AMS->TXL flight.  The last activity was 6/23 evening, it was scanned as loaded onto the JFK->AMS flight, but then the trail goes cold. I've called delta, kms, txl baggage, jfk baggage and ams baggage offices, they all are reading the same thing I'm seeing. 

I'm in Berlin only two more nights and then I'm supposed to be participating in a bike race, which will be difficult without my bike.  

My question is: is there anything else I could do?  Do I just have to wait and hope something happens in the next two days before I leave Berlin?  

And if I need to leave before I depart from Berlin, will the airline ship my bike back to my home address?  it's not a cheap bike!

Relatively Inexperienced Flyer Questions,1,c59n5x,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/c59n5x/relatively_inexperienced_flyer_questions/,3,"So I need to take my boy down to see his grandmother who is not in the best of health.  We are trying to work out the best situation and I could use just a bit of help.

I have the Delta Skymiles card with just slightly over 31,000 miles on it, most of them being the bonus you get for having the card.  It wasn't in my plans to fly anytime soon, but this is sort of important.  Last time I flew was over 15 years ago and am in no hurry to squeeze my fat and tall self back into an airplane seat.  We really can't afford buying an extra seat, so I figure if I get a window seat and my boy gets the middle, I can at least have my arm and shoulder in his area (he's 9, so he's still a little guy).  My ass is malleable enough to squeeze in, so I'm not all that concerned.  A little, but if I can fit in seats at Wrigley Field, then I think I'm golden!

So I've been looking at these flights that go from Chicago to Fort Myers. They all have stops but in different places.  I saw yesterday that they had one that would have gone to New York and then down to Fort Myers that was in the 17,500 price range for the miles.  I can buy 4000 miles for $140 to get us over the hump.  But today, those flights are up to 23,500 miles for getting there and another 23,500 to get home.  This would have been perfect, as the flights were on planes with at least 18"" seats.  Just trying to get the best comfort I can, every little bit helps.  

So, will these prices go up and down, or is it probably at this price from here on out?  Are there days that are known to have prices go up or down, days to avoid buying tickets or vice versa?  We are looking at the beginning of August, because that's when the flights are most affordable.

I know that we can do the basic economy, but I don't want to take the chance that I won't be sitting next to my boy.  He's never flown before, so I'd like to share the excitement with him.

Thanks in advance for any knowledge and advice.",1561502889.0

My flight was delayed 4 and a half hours. I had booked a Delta flight from JFK to DC that I subsequently missed because I arrived from my delayed flight too late. 

British Airways refuses to help out in any way or even put me in a hotel, because apparently this was my last destination and my connecting flight is Delta, not BA, so they’re not responsible for incurred expenses. 

If I find a Delta help desk, will they be able to help me and rebook me? Does anyone have any advice at all in this regard?

Update: Delta thankfully booked me for the next flight, but it was in the morning. No thanks to British Airways and their lack of accommodating me, I was stuck in the city for the night now due to the delay, until my new flight. Ended up getting myself to a hotel by 3 am. 

That being said - If anyone has experience with BA and requesting compensation due to delays in this sort of situation, do let me know, I would appreciate it. Most people inside the airport not working for BA told me I should be compensated because the flight was delayed for a) 4 and a 1/2 hours, b) due to engine issues (not weather related, etc, which changes likelihood of being compensated) and c) directly caused me to incur expenses due to said delay.",1561200867.0

Delta Skymiles Booster Not Worth,9,c1plje,delta,https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/c1plje/delta_skymiles_booster_not_worth/,12,"So in doing some review of pricing, I've found that the mileage booster is actually not as cost effective as the Miles + Cash option. For instance:  


Cost for Flight in Cash = $345.30  
Cost for Flight in Miles = 28,500 miles  
Cost for Flight in Miles and Cash = 18,500 miles + $180.00    
Cost for Flight w/ Miles Reimbursed from Mileage Booster (6,000 miles) = 22,500 miles + $118.00  


Full cash option = 28,500 miles / S345.30 = 82.53 miles per dollar  
Cash cost for Miles + Cash = 10,000 miles / $180 = 55.5 miles per dollar  
Cash cost for mileage booster miles =  6,000 miles / $118 = 50.8 miles per dollar  


Mileage booster cost for 6,000 miles = $118.00  
Miles + cash cost for 6,000 miles = $108.11  


It doesn't seem like the mileage booster makes cost effective sense in any way.

First delay: 12 hours due to weather in Chicago (I understand this alone is not grounds for a reimbursement)

The next day: boarded the plane, then was forced to deplane because they had to find new staff. The flight was delayed so long that the air crew was timed out. 

Once we received a new flight, we started heading back to Chicago. Once we were flying over Montana, the plane turned back for Salt Lake City. We were informed that the gates at O’Hare were in use, even though O’Hare told us to fly. We turned around and landed back in Salt Lake City. This was the first time Delta offered a hotel room.

We have economy tickets and are assigned to main cabin where for some reason we cant select our seats. My understanding so far is we check in and are assigned random seats at the gate? Will we be seated together or randomly? My main concern with this process is the flight is 15 hours straight and we should be seated together since I bought 2 tickets on the same transaction(probably doesn't work that way, right?)

How can I get seated together? Should I check in asap online or be at LAX hours before hand?

Can I stream HULU/NETFLIX with the gogo wifi?

How and when can I upgrade to comfort plus if need be, also whats the going price?

Of course this is not the end of the world but just a preference, I would of thought about it more when I booked the flights if I had known the seating process for Delta as Virgin Australia has a great system where I can choose and upgrade as I'm choosing if I wanted.

"American Nightmare (SJT -> DFW -> PIT, 3 days)",2,dn7emp,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/dn7emp/american_nightmare_sjt_dfw_pit_3_days/,4,"This story starts yesterday, Thursday October 24, 2019. I was to return home from a work trip in west Texas, flying out of San Angelo. 

I arrived at the airport a bit earlier than anticipated due to change of plans with work earlier that day. As the day went on the flights from San Angelo to Dallas started to get delayed. Finally my flight was cancelled all together. 

Day 1 shot. Cancelled, officially due to weather although some people were initially told it was a maintenance issue. Of course, weather cancellation meant no comped hotel. 

Went to the counter to get my checked bag so I could have my toiletries and clothes. People were upset, they even tried to reschedule one man on a Monday flight.

I was told my bags were already at Dallas, and they’d be sent along to my final destination ahead of me. Guy at the desk at least got me booked on a flight on Friday at 2:26pm. So there I was left on my own, no transportation, no clothes, no toiletries, and no place to stay. 

I was able to find a hotel and lucky enough to get an Uber set up. Guy from behind the counter came over, after seeing how upset I was, and said he was able to get my bag now. He also asked if I got a hotel, minutes after I booked one for that night, just to tel me that they had special rates at some hotels. Could’ve used that info ten minutes ago. At least I had my checked bag. 

Day 2. Arrived at the airport, checked in. Delays. Here we go again. Another delay. Things aren’t looking up. Another delay, followed by notices I likely won’t make my connection. Annnddd another delay. Definitely missing my connection. 

Girl behind the desk tries, but no other flights back to Pittsburgh from Dallas for that day, and gives my an 800 number to call. I’m on the verge of making a 22 hour drive at this point just to get out of this nightmare. 

Call the 800 number and was able to get on a 6am flight from Dallas to Pitt on Saturday morning. At least if my San Angelo flight got cancelled I’d be able to make the drive to Dallas and still make my early morning flight. 

Day 2 shot, not getting home again. 

All in all, lesson learned. Never fly into or out of San Angelo. Never count on American. If you need to get to west Texas, best option is to fly into Dallas ( any airline) and drive the rest of the way. At least then you won’t be at the mercy of regionals that may hold you hostage and cause multiple day delays. 

I could’ve literally driven back home (22 hr drive) in the amount of time I’ve wasted with American at San Angelo.",1572083457.0

I'll be coming to DFW airport for an internship with AA from January 2020-August 2020, and I was wondering if any of you employees have any recommendations about where to live for the period? I'm looking for a rental near DFW for 8 months and would like something cheap, safe, and convenient. I'm not living with anybody else, and I don't really care about noise b/c it's close to an airport, so I expect it, but there shouldn't be parties going on throughout the night. I don't really care about utilities, because I can pay for that, nor the type of complex. I don't really care about schools, pools, pet policy, gyms or elevator, doorman, stuff like that.  I'm looking mainly at studios and 1 bedroom apartments.

1. Something close to the airport, no more than 25 minute drive
2. Complex must have good reviews
3. Apartment must have A/C, heat, and a kitchen (can be small)
4. Must be no more than $950 a month
5. Should be close to grocery stores, shopping, restaurants, post office, etc. (Somewhere not desolate)
6. Area should have a low crime rate and be safe
7. Should have washer and dryer machines in unit and be decently furnished, such as contain a stove, fridge, toilet, shower, etc, as well as contain a decent number of power outlets and at least a close (or substitute) and adequate lighting with windows and lights
8. Should have parking
9. Should be liveable and be in good condition without a lot of mice/cockroaches
10. Landlord should be responsive to requests and maintenance
11. Shouldn't be a compound that allows smoking

I opted to leave soon and get the connecting flight. I was told this was my best option at the gate since it would give time for the storm to pass. 

Well obviously as soon as the flight gets on the tarmac, I get a notice the flights cancelled as I frantically try and call before takeoff which I am not able to get hold of anyone in that time.

I go and check again and they tell me my bag got moved to the holding area for my flight tomorrow and ""its not possible to get it tonight"". I need my inhaler so I complain about that for a while and they say just wait 30 minutes they put in another request. Obviously it never showed up and its extremely late so I inquire about getting compensated for a hotel and they tell me just to wait in the airport until my next flight ""don't worry we are here for another 7 hours too"" is what they said.

The flight is completely overbooked and they start offering people $600 to take other flights. I'm told at this point once enough people volunteer I should have a seat. Thankfully enough people do and I get on the flight.

However at this point I am out the hotel charge, the uber charge, my original missed hotel in chicago charge which I couldn't get a refund for, and now I need to rent a car when I land since the hotel shuttle (which the hotel is an hour north of chicago) wasn't scheduled to make any trips that morning. When I did finally get my bag in O'hare it had the pull notice tag still on it, so I know they got the notice and just ignored it.

I tried contacting reservations but they said since my original flight was cancelled due to weather it was out of their control. The refund page online says I need ticket numbers which I can't seem to find anywhere. They arent in the app and my emails are bare bones and just have an itinerary along with the cancellation emails. 

Is there some other department to contact? What can I even do.",1569897266.0

AA needs Policy Makers that Know Math,0,dazwv6,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/dazwv6/aa_needs_policy_makers_that_know_math/,13,"Context: a month prior to a trip, I needed to make changes to a nonrefundable ticket. I need to push return  flight a few days later. I called a month prior. They said to make the change it's $200. This is more than the cost of a new ticket ($160). Here's the kicker, if I wanted to straight out cancel, it would STILL cost $200. The agent told me my best course of action was just to not show up. Basically they're losing out on a new passenger purchasing my seat. They're betting on me to buy a new one way, BUT that's under the assumption I'm using AA again which I'm not. Found a better flight through Southwest which has an awesome cancellation policy. I'd at least get Southwest travel funds if I cancel. AA TAKE NOTE: THIS IS HOW YOU RETAIN CUSTOMERS

If AA did their math right they could have removed me from the flight list for free and have someone else purchase the seat. 

As a long time customer, it'd be nice if they could offer a little bit of travel credit as well. But of course they're not customer centric enough to think about this. They use all means they can to suck money out but then shoot themselves in the foot because of their greed. Their inflexible policy leaves a very bad aftertaste and brand image. I've use AA growing up but now that I'm working I'm really starting to explore other airlines and am discovering that they are much much more customer friendly.

My suggestion: put a time frame for changes. $50 for changing at least three weeks before and $200 or something for after. This gives passengers more security when purchasing tickets or else right now AA is always my last resort because JetBlue and Southwest have better security with noninsured tickets. And for the love of God let people cancel for free, maybe offer a little travel credit for good faith. Their current practice is just stupid, no wonder their business isn't going that great. Their brand positioning is garbage. User experience journey isn't thought out.

EDIT: I realized we need a math lesson.
Let's pretend original flight cost $180 (main cabin). To change it cost $200. To cancel it still costs $200. I'd spend $380 if I did either on something that was $180. A new flight is $65 on different airline. The best option provided is to take the $180 loss by not doing ANYTHING and take the new flight $65. So I'm paying $245 versus $380 for this flight had I officially made a change/cancellation. Still sucks but could be worse.

NOW the airline itself could have had an additional $180 had they removed me off the flight for free. STANDBYS ALREADY PAID for a different flight. Them getting on this one isn't earning the airline any new money. Multiply $180 by all the people that wanted to cancel but best course of action was to just not show up and leave it to stand bys.",1569814189.0

American is really improving,43,d7m05r,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/d7m05r/american_is_really_improving/,4,"tl;dr: AA has turned around big time since summer and is truly focusing on customer service again. It's running flights on time, making up for delays, and taking care of customers; I'm glad I stayed loyal. 

I can imagine the downvotes and  scowls I may receive for this, but I have to say, I just flew a four segment from Podunkity through DFW to the Midwest and back, just a quick two-day flight, and I could really see the difference from earlier this summer. In fact, there's a city I fly to several times a year, and I happen to know one of the gate agents there because I wrote AA about her when a passenger railed into her and the woman responded like an absolute SAINT. I complimented the gate agent to her boss and asked how to give her accolades, and he said tweeting was the best way, by the way. The gate agent and I now say hello each time I pass through. When I landed the other night, we chatted and she said it's different for them since summer too. I told her how I was noticing it seemed different. Gate agents definitely get the brunt. I'm not saying everything is perfect or anything, but there was things I noticed, such as at DFW the passenger assistance lines, which were rows long, almost into the terminal themselves this summer, were quite short--every single one I passed--both days. Also, I noticed one had a ""refuel and refresh"" stand with free bags of chips, fruit, and cans of soda, which would be really nice when DFW charges $3 for a bottle of Coke or water. That's the type of little thing I was seeing, the customer service side that's standing out. On board, it was a class act all the way. I know, I know, there are outliers. There are always outliers. Today, both my flights started out running late. There were weather issues both in the Midwest and at DFW. The pilots in both planes were incredibly apologetic. The app had the red ""delayed"" signs in it, but we arrived only 10 minutes late for one flight--and TWO minutes late for the other. And at one airport I did not see any cancellations listed--I was looking on purpose. I honestly was growing concerned last summer because I am pretty invested in AA and I was not liking what I was seeing, but I think they were beginning to realize it was costing them business and loyalty.  I think they are trying. The experience has been vastly different. I have flown every month this year, at least once, and if you can picture a graph trending mostly higher--there were a few spikes along the way but now it's consistently higher--that's been my anecdotal experience. I have flown out of Podunkity where American Eagle, obviously operated by SkyWest, Envoy and the like flies, DFW, and medium sized cities (three airports near me). I have flown to the Southwest, Midwest (multiple times, various large metro areas), Europe--solely on American)--I have the West Coast and Canada ahead, as well as multiple Midwestern trips ahead, but all that to say, I have been multiple places multiple times, certainly not as much as a business traveler, but mostly in economy where I don't get a lot of perks, so I am quite aware of whether basic service is decent or not.  American is finally trending back up. This quick jaunt up the center of the country was encouraging to me. I have been on a quest for elite status all year and this summer things were so bad I wondered why I was bothering and was even wondering if I could switch airlines--but I was stuck because my main destination is really only served by AA. But this trip made me glad I set my goal for Gold on American. And guess what, since all my flights went, as soon as those miles post sometime tonight or tomorrow, I am there--9 months after I set out to earn Gold Elite--all on economy flying, sans one segment of Premium Economy.",1569157139.0

Since I never made my original destination AA issued a ~$400 voucher for a trip in vain. I used this voucher plus $40 many months later for a personal trip, which I ended up canceling due to unforseen circumstances. I fully expected to pay the $200 cancellation fee which would have left me with the $40 and the remaining $200 on the voucher. When I checked, I was only issued the $40. One quick call to Customer Relations and 2 minutes later it was resolved. They issued the remainder, a full refund of ~$400 in another voucher. Thanks AA!

Second
I am around 110 segments YTD and am trying to hit 120 for Executive Platinum. I noticed that I was only credited with 1 of 2 segments plus miles for a recent trip. I called AA customer service and 45 seconds later I was credited the additional segment and miles. Thanks AA!

I am not posting these antidotes to discount anyone's frustration in their particular situation. I am posting to show that AA does have satisfied customers out there. 

I suspect that most of the complaints on this sub are from non-frequent fliers that have a small sample size. When I have several delays or a cancellation, it's something I am used to dealing with and happens on a very small percentage of my flights. If I flew twice a year my perception would be skewed if one of those (50%) were delayed or cancelled.",1568504088.0

Horrible Customer Service,0,d43cae,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/d43cae/horrible_customer_service/,25,"I was set to fly to Madrid on August 25, 2019, so when I checked my email to look for my flight information, I  was distraught to not find any email. I called American Airlines customer service twice, and both times they told me that they needed my flight number in order to look up the flight--the flight number that I didn't have because I can't find the email.  They told me that the flight dates, my email address, and my name were insufficient to locate my ticket. I figured maybe I had forgotten to actually buy  my ticket which I remember cost around $600, so I let it go.

....Until I received an email on the morning of August 25, saying to get ready for my flight. In a panic, I called customer service who told me that I could email customer relations and maybe they can ""do something for me"".

I emailed customer relations, and they were of no help. They told me that they should have been able to locate my flight information with my email address, my name, and the flight dates and cities from which they depart. I called customer service once more, and the person I talked to was able to locate my ticket. She said it had been cancelled of course. 

I am a college student, so spending $600 on a flight is a big deal to me. I had to pay for another flight because of this situation. 

I simply wanted a refund or at least a credit. Instead what I got was horrible customer service from American Airlines. You can bet that I will never fly with AA again, and I will tell all my friends and family to not fly with AA and about what a nightmare of a situation I had to deal with as a customer.",1568484375.0
Buddy Pass - Current situation,2,d3scwe,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/d3scwe/buddy_pass_current_situation/,15,"Alright guys, I'll try to explain this the best I can. Me and my wife are going to Argentina in December. A friend of mine works for AA and was willing to give me and my wife a Buddy Pass for our trip. This saved us a TON of money. 

Fast forward to about a couple months ago, he ends up getting another job within AA but it's a different management (i.e. Nike store to Nike corporate). He told me that by doing so, unbeknownst to him, we are now restricted flyers until his probation (6 months from hire date) is up. Meaning our buddy pass tickets are not valid anymore. 

So what's at question here is, if his probation started when he first started at his first AA job in April? Or does it start when he started his second job with AA in July? If it started in April, then our restricted status will be lifted by December and no problem there. If it started in July, then we are screwed unfortunately. 

He's been trying to inquire information from his management but this is a first for them so he's been hearing many different things. Have you guys ever encountered anything similar to this? Any help would be great! Thanks!",1568423435.0

**Background**:

· I booked a trip to Dublin 6+ months ago (with a connection in PHL) and paid to upgrade my seats to preferred seats in and out of Dublin. 

· I received a confirmation email for said seat upgrades ($89 each, row 10 side by side).

· I’ve checked the app for weeks and my seats have shown up.

· I checked today, and all of a sudden it says my trip has been cancelled (WTF!)

· I called customer service (1-800-7300) and spoke to someone and then his supervisor; they said the system created a duplicate record and those seats are now unavailable. 

· They’re saying the only open seats are not beside one another and are rows apart.

· I looked online and there are several seats available as upgrades; I asked to be upgraded to two of those seats because the seats we paid for have now been taken

· The supervisor said she isn’t able to do that and told me to email customer relations

**My Question:**

· I emailed customer relations, but I'm not confident that I'll hear back. This seems totally unfair / predatory for a company to do.

· I paid for those seats and even have the email confirmation. It’s not my fault if AA created a duplicate record.

· Any advice???",1568007657.0

3. Is it true that the customer relations rep ""cannot transfer me to a manager"" and that ""there is no one else to file a complaint to""? I find this very hard to believe.

Story for those that are interested: AA boarded us on a flight scheduled on 9/2 at 8:30PM, made everyone wait with no explanation until 11:30PM, then kicked everyone off the plane because ""they don't have a pilot and the new pilots that were told to fly this aircraft threw a temper tantrum and refuse to come"", as per the flight attendants.

Unexpected American Airline flight changes,8,cza8rw,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/cza8rw/unexpected_american_airline_flight_changes/,26,"American Airlines emailed me today about flight changes to my existing booking. They randomly changed my flight to a different time. I’m guessing they overbooked. What’s worse is I discovered that they changed my flight 2 days ago but they only sent me the notification today. 

I picked a specific time slot for my flight because I have a cruise that docks that day and I want to make it home in time to get some sleep before work the next day. I called them as soon as I saw the email and they told me they can pick a different flight path that ensures I can leave and land close to my original booking times. Mind you I also paid extra for better seats since my bf is 6’4 with back issues and needs the ability to stretch his legs. 

They told me that if I wanted the same seats, I would have to pay significantly more. I don’t feel like that’s fair since I paid for the flights and specific seating months ago. After tons of arguing and speaking to a supervisor, it was determined that the assigned seating price was higher because the first connecting flight is longer but that also means the final connecting fight would be cheaper. Long story short, I would pay only $10 more but again, I still am paying. At this point I was over it and was like, take the difference, give me my flight, and leave me alone. They then proceeded to charge me multiple times. According to my cc statement I have $402 worth of charges total. I called back and she said that till it clears nothing can be done because they can’t tell me what I got charged for. I’m supposed to get a refund but who knows when that will happen.

On a flight from EZE to LAX (13+ hours) I was seated next to an elderly lady who seemed initially a little agitated but basically a sweetheart who I enjoyed chatting with, who, in the middle of the flight, began screaming at the top of her lungs for HOURS in Spanish, Portuguese and an unidentified language (maybe Latin? maybe tongues?) AND THE CREW HEARD HER AND DID NOTHING. It was insane. The bits of her screaming that I could understand were that she was keeping the plane from crashing by talk/scream/praying to God. Myself and multiple other passengers made very clear to the crew that we felt unsafe for ourselves and for her... I was more scared that she was having a heart attack or panic attack or something. After I first asked the crew for help, and two of the flight attendants told me and other passengers that  “she's crazy and ignore her.” I suggested that maybe she was in pain or crying for help since I don’t speak or understand a ton of Spanish or Portuguese and she seemed seriously not well, and the attendants thanked me for my concern, but again told me to “just ignore it.” While roughly five to six other passengers tried to quiet the disturbed passenger or to get her to respond (she stayed unresponsive), only one flight attendant attempted to speak to the screaming passenger.  I used the word attempted, because the  passenger was totally unresponsive to the crew member who gave up after a minute or two. The lady next to me screamed until breakfast was served, and then she scarfed two meals and passed out. Once we got to customs, several other passengers thanked me for taking care of the screaming lady since the flight attendants refused to! It was totally insane-- we all felt like we'd gotten smacked in the face with crazy pills. 

When I initially reported this to American, the two phone reps I talked to were super concerned and empathetic and  guaranteed us refunds on our flight but they said we had to email American Airlines customer relations. Fast forward to multiple emails and a month later, and American Airlines decided I was just ""bothered"" by a passenger and that surely it was down to a ""simple conflict"" between passengers. To me, being bothered by a fellow passenger is maybe when someone snores, fights over the arm rest or needs a shower. The passenger next to me was visibly mentally upset, ill and potentially dangerous to herself, to me and to other passengers on the airplane. It was scary. I have been witness to several exceptional situations on lengthy flights, and typically the crew is responsive, quick, and isolates the endangering or endangered passenger. This absolutely was not the case. 

Now I'm just kicking myself for not filming the whole thing so I can post it and finally get American Airlines to contact me. Bottom line: FILM EVERYTHING!!! I was trying to be respectful of the poor screaming lady and the crew, but in the future, I'm gonna whip out my phone.",1565934053.0

Delayed baggage compensation/Other compensation,0,cmhy6b,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/cmhy6b/delayed_baggage_compensationother_compensation/,5,"Hello everyone! Without going into the nitty gritty, I had a terrible experience with American Airlines. My flight was delayed (weather of course) by what amounted to a full 24hrs. I have two basic questions regarding contacting them for reimbursement. 

I contacted the customer service/relations whatever to see if I could get a refund/voucher for the experience. They responded with ""sorry but nothing"" essentially. Is there a way to appeal this? 

I recognize that was unlikely. My problem was less with the actual delay, and more with staff insisting that our flight would be leaving that day. Later on, I was informed (by AA staff) that the airline was aware of major travel delays, and the workers felt they should've cancelled ahead of time. My gripe is that had the airline been honest with me, I could've found alternate transportation home (I was about 3.5 hrs away by car). I would've arrived at 4PM that day instead of 11 am the next.

Is there any chance I would receive some sort of compensation on the basis of airline staff not being upfront about the expectations regarding future flights that day? I could've returned home roughly 20 hrs earlier for roughly the same amount of money had staff been honest and said ""it's likely you will not be flying out today or tonight"". 

In addition to this, my baggage was delayed upon returning. I paid roughly 30 USD for my bag. Despite it being in the airport for 24 hrs, I arrived at my destination without baggage. I had to wait another 6 hours for the baggage to be delivered, and was stuck (my only clothing) wearing an outfit that I had been wearing for roughly two days at this point. 

Their response (despite me writing on this) did not mention the baggage. Can I get at least the 30 dollars reimbursed? I recognize the rest is sort of a pipe dream, but I don't think (after this experience) it's too much to ask that they at least compensate me for not getting my (paid out of pocket) baggage to me on time. 

Sorry this is a long post, thanks for any help I can get.",1565072440.0

AA Not Responding to Complaint,2,clyhmm,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/clyhmm/aa_not_responding_to_complaint/,11,"Hi All! I don’t usually fly American, but I chose it over Southwest and Delta for my trip to Mexico in June. On my way home, I connected in Dallas. My flight was a disaster—we sat on the runway for two hours since we couldn’t take off due to a radio tower being down. By the time we got back to the gate (due to FAA regulations regarding sitting on tarmac), it was storming, which grounded flights. However, our flight was ultimately canceled about four hours after the flight due to the delays and our flight crew being timed out.

My rescheduled flight was not until 36 hours (one of the soonest they could do), and they were not issuing any vouchers for hotels at the airport. It was all a huge mess, which ultimately cost me $180 out of pocket for staying until my flight home. On top of it, they wouldn’t give us back our luggage, so I was without my suitcase during that time.

This was back in late June. I have reached out to American twice using their online contact form. I have received confirmation they received both of them, yet I have not gotten a response (first sent late June, second a week and a half ago; I have checked my spam folder, and there are no responses in there). I’ve tried calling them, but they will only help regarding current travel issues rather than travel in the past. I’ve  tried tweeting them, but that didn’t do anything, either. Since I booked the tickets using AmEx points I reached out to them to see if I could get some points reimbursed or my lodging compensated, but they said this was an airline issue.

I’m honestly lost as to what I can do to get my complaint addressed. I can keep trying using the contact form, but I don’t have faith that will work. I feel like they should at least give me a voucher, especially since the impetus of our delay was mechanical rather than weather (since we would not have run into whether delays and taken off on time if the radio tower was up).

Does anybody have suggestions as to what I can do or have any advice? I know this is sort of petty, but at this point, it is less about getting a voucher (although I’d love that) and more about them acknowledging the situation and their poor customer service.",1564966097.0

I was put on a flight the next day. I was booked a hotel through American Airlines that used to be a strip club...


Coming from Mexico City my flight was delayed again which made me miss my connecting flight to Beijing in Dallas.

I’m now boarding my flight from Mexico City to LA where I have a 14 hour layover and they are providing me with a hotel.

Also with the new travel arrangements they put me in a middle seat for each leg of my travel.

Not once did the gate attendant  offer to bump me up to business class or put me in a exit row.

When I asked they said it would cost extra.... are you kidding me!! 

I’ve reached out to customer service they in turn told me to send an email on the website via complaint line.

The customer service is just unbearable.


I’m looking at 30 hours of delays for this vacation. 

I’m going to ask for a full refund let’s see how it goes..",1563944151.0

Never flying American Airlines again,6,cgl568,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/cgl568/never_flying_american_airlines_again/,14,"This happened to my parents while visiting me 2 weeks ago.

MOST HORRIBLE AMERICAN AIRLINES EXPERIENCE EVER!

July 9 - PHL to LAX - Flight Cancelled - multiple inconveniences with car rental companies to try and re-book new date and arguments with car rental for refunds and 1 day lost with family. AA employee that provided the voucher for hotel was very nasty and rude and even told me to shut up when i tried to ask her a question. 

July 10 - PHL to MIA - arrived to MIA and sat in the plane for 30 min - no consideration for connecting flights -arrived with only 5 minutes to spare to other terminal for connecting flight MIA to LAX - Cristi is mentally disabled and her anxiety extremely high due to the stress of potentially missing the connecting flight given her experience the day before in PHL.

July 16 - LAX to MIA - flight scheduled to depart at 1:20 PM, AA employee named Erny - very rude, told me that he was busy and could not answer me, then told me the gate was 41, shortly after the gate was changed to 43 over the loud speaker. After boarding the plane we received notices every 15 min that flight was delayed. Crew members advised that there was a crack in the cargo hold and it would be fixed within an hour. While still on the plane, continued receiving notices regarding the delays. At some point the captain was called outside of the plane and came back to notify us that there was another problem and we had to wait another half hour. Overall we were on the plane for almost 4 hours before take off. We were scheduled to arrive at MIA by 9:30 PM or so and did not land in MIA till 1:20 AM. Once landed, a crew member blocked the isle having a conversation with another passenger - she refused to move the conversation, so inconsiderate that we had been in the plane an additional 4 hours.

This was the most horrible experience in flying we have ever had. Unnecessary rudeness, attitudes from American Airlines employees, passengers are already struggling to get to their destinations without having rude employees giving attitude for airline cancellations and late departures that were not caused by passengers. Not to mention that mentally ill passengers that are affected in ways that are not seen to the naked eye.",1563868854.0

&#x200B;

Detailed below is the jaw-dropping sequence of events I experienced on flight AA0481, which was a non-stop flight scheduled to leave LAX at 4:39pm on July 7th, arriving in Philadelphia at 12:58am. This flight was delayed 16 times before its ultimate cancellation. I have tried to detail each event as carefully and accurately as possible.Before I even arrived at the terminal on the day of departure, the flight had already been delayed almost two hours. We were originally supposed to leave at 4:39pm: our first time boarding was close to the 6 o'clock hour.

The first issue noticed with the plane is a dent on the engine. After the pilot notifies the passengers of this, we are stuck on the tarmac for at least an hour before the announcement is made that the dent had been solved with speed tape. The pilot assures us that this is ""completely legal"". Since the passengers are more concerned with out safety than with the legality of American Airlines' repairs, this mostly makes the cabin nervous.Once the repair has been made, the pilot announces that the crew was about to be overtime and that a new crew was needed to staff the plane. A flight crew that was arriving from Chicago was asked to come work our flight, but after at least another hour, it was announced that the new crew refused to fly our plane. We are asked to return to the gate until a new crew could be found. The new departure time is 10pm.

By the time we deplane, it is close to 8pm. There has been no assurance that we will even have a new pilot in time for 10pm departure, and there has been no mention of compensation for lost time for any passengers. We are told that if we wish to try and negotiate new tickets, we can speak to customer service agents. One of the defining aspects of this disaster is the complete and utter lack of transparency from gate agents, flight staff, and customer service. It only gets worse from here. Many of the people who tried to speak with customer service have not been served because the line was so slow. Those who do reach customer service are offered only a meal voucher. This is around 9pm. Many of the passengers I've spoken to have already mentioned that they will be forced to go straight to work from PHL when we arrive, even if the flight leaves at the newly scheduled departure time. Eventually, we board the plane for a 10pm departure, at around 9:30pm.

The pilot mentions that since there is a new crew, the flight plans need to be re-adjusted which should take no longer than 15 minutes. There are no more announcements for over a half-hour. At 10:45pm, the plane begins to taxi, but is interrupted when the pilot announces that an issue with the air valve is discovered. The plane turns around to go back to the gate and be inspected for the second time tonight. Passengers want to know why this was not inspected during the hour and a half when we were waiting in line to receive meal vouchers. The flight is now not expected to leave until at least midnight.

&#x200B;

At this point, we are already supposed to have arrived in Philadelphia.

&#x200B;

At 12:00am, we are told that there will be another delay before leaving, because a different plane had a medical emergency on board. We do not begin to taxi for about another 10 minutes, since we cannot access the gate to have the air valve checked out. At 12:20am, the flight begins to taxi on the runway. What follows was the most disturbing part of this entire mess. The plane begins to take-off: wheels get off the ground, and the nose of the plane is up. Suddenly, the pilot brings the plane back to the ground, slams into the runway, and slams the brakes. A woman in the back of the plane has a panic attack and begins hyperventilating. There is no announcement about why we failed to take-off for almost five minutes after returning to the gate, and most of the cabin is full of hysterical passengers. This is the moment where even flight attendants were concerned the plane almost crashed.

Eventually, the pilot announces that the sensor lights for the braking system had gone off, and he was unsure if the brakes were overheated, so he landed just in case. By the estimation of the passengers on the plane, if the light had gone on even ten seconds later, we would not have been able to land the plane in time to investigate the issue. When we return to the gate, an announcement is made that “passengers are welcome to leave the plane and try to rebook with the gate agent"". We are told that if we left the plane we would NOT be allowed back on, and that our checked bags would be shipped to us, since they could not remove them from the plane. A father of two young children tells me that all of his baby's clothes, food, and stroller are underneath the plane, not to mention his family’s entire luggage.

About 1/3 of the passengers are so unsettled by the multitude of technical issues that the plane has experienced that they get off without the assurance of compensation for rebooking, a refund, or accommodations for the night. Several members of the flight crew are now overtime and have to deplane. One of the stewardesses is so disturbed by the take-off that she leaves the plane in tears. None of the flight crew knows anything, and give the impression that they are deeply uncomfortable with the issues the plane is experiencing. We stay on the runway for at least another 90 minutes.

At this point, passengers have been on the tarmac for over 3 hours straight. We have spent probably 6 hours on the plane total. The flight has been delayed by 9 hours. We have been told we cannot deplane if we wish to keep our flight. I want to stress this point: we have been on the runway for over 3 hours, and have been told that if we leave the plane we will have to find new tickets. The estimated time of departure is now 1:15am. No further announcement is made until 2am, when we still have not moved.At 2am, the pilot announces that the mechanics could not diagnose the problem with the braking system, and so we are deplaning. No one knows when the next flight will be, but the passengers queue up at the same customer service desk as before.

It takes several hours for me to be served--many passengers were still in line when I left. The attendants provided different information depending on who they spoke to, and were visibly irritated with all of us. The man behind me calls his boss to inform him of the delays, and hangs up with tears in his eyes, stating that he has lost $400.At 5am, I am given a $12 meal voucher, a reservation at the La Quinta Inn in Santa Ana for that night (35 minutes away), and the boarding passes for a flight to Philadelphia stopping St. Louis that would leave at 7:45 pm the next day. I would arrive in Philadelphia at 9am. My checked bag will arrive in Philadelphia before me, so I have no change of clothes and no toiletries. I would later learn from other passengers that some people were provided hotel vouchers that had reservations on the wrong day. Those passengers were turned away from the hotel and forced to return to the airport.

While I am provided a hotel voucher, I was only allowed to stay in the hotel for about 6 hours, since American Airlines kept my check-out time for noon. This leaves about 7 hours where I have nowhere to stay, and am still waiting for my next flight.  I have slept for a total of 5 hours in the past two days, and am scheduled to arrive at my destination 29 hours late. I have received 16 e-mails notifying me that my flight is delayed. The conditions of this flight were much more than poor customer service. They were cruel, inhumane, and deeply costly to every passenger on board. Most passengers lost at least a full workday, many of us lost two. A man in front of me on the flight missed his first day at a new job.The original, non-stop flight was delayed 20 hours, 43 minutes (12:58am arrival to 9:41pm arrival). Ultimately, I arrived in Philadelphia on flight AA5325 on time, at 9:04am on July 8. This was roughly 29 hours later than I had planned. By my estimation, had we been flying for this length of time at 500mph (slightly slower than the average cruising speed of an A380 Airbus), we could have traveled over 14,000 miles.

Flight cancelled for morning of 7/7 next option AA is giving is Tuesday 7/9.,1,ca95y4,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/ca95y4/flight_cancelled_for_morning_of_77_next_option_aa/,1,"My wife and I woke up this morning to a text saying our flight had been cancelled (text came at 3:41am) so we started heading up to the airport, logged in on flight change on our phones, and got on hold with their phone service to figure out options. We're in Orange County, CA so SNA to DFW was our flight but we were open to even going to San Diego, LAX or wherever to try and make it. 

&#x200B;

When I logged in online to change flights the only options I'm given were for Tuesday. The phone service call drops (this has happened 3 times now in the past 2 hours) and eventually we get up to the AA counter at the airport after waiting in line for a short while. The lady tells us there's nothing she can do but here's the catch, all other flights to DFW are continuing. As she's telling us ""nothing until Tuesday"" I'm watching the ticker behind her show multiple flights to DFW from SNA today. ""How about tomorrow?"" ""Nothing until Tuesday.""

&#x200B;

So not that this matters, but we're both dentists coming off a long holiday weekend meaning not only are we fully booked but will for sure have emergency call ins from over the weekend. Missing two days of work for us is financially a major difference compared to whatever compensation of miles/credit/refund they're going to offer so needless to say we're pretty motivated to find a solution.

&#x200B;

""Can we fly out of another city or connect through somewhere?"" ""Nothing until Tuesday."" She seems to have a stock answer at this point. What does seem to change her mental algorithm is me asking ""Can you put us on another airline?""

&#x200B;

At that point she says she can connect us to Houston tomorrow (why wasn't this option given first?) and then we can try to get a connecting flight to DFW or drive. At least we're getting somewhere at this point. In a moment of frustration I google flights from SNA to DFW on July 7th and google - not some subsidiary company that aggregates flight info- pulls up that Delta has a flight from LAX direct to DFW this afternoon. Would it make us get in later? Sure. But that's better than losing 2 days worth of seeing patients.

&#x200B;

I show the flight to the American service representative and she says she has no record of this flight and that if I book it she can't help me and I'll get no compensation or refund on my flight. About this time the AA phone representative picks up and we talk. I give him a rundown of the situation and he says, ""I don't have a record of that flight but if you get on that flight we'll refund the ticket price for your return."" Not really an acceptable solution in my opinion but at least we can subsidize some of the cost. I'm curious why the lady at the counter told me a different story?

&#x200B;

While my wife begins talking to the Delta rep at the desk to confirm everything the AA guy stays on the line with me. He makes all kinds of small talk trying to diffuse the situation. He's clearly googled me and is asking about things local to my home address and my practice. ""Have you ever been to Eagle Lake?"" ""No."" ""Oh is your office in the hospital? I forget the name."" ""No I'm a dentist, I have my own location."" ""Did you know the women's World Cup is on right now?"" He was nice, but I wasn't really in the mood for small talk with 3 people trying to update me on what was going on. 

&#x200B;

Delta got us on a flight direct from LAX (not our original flight location) direct home. We get home at 10:29 pm instead of 3ish pm on AA but at least we'll get home. Ask the Delta rep confirms and prints our tickets the AA phone call ends abruptly. Weird thing though it didn't drop, I was sent to the robot that asked if I wanted to leave a review of my experience? You bet I did.

&#x200B;

So I call back to confirm everything and work on refunds/compensation and get a new rep about 40 minutes later. Pretty quickly after getting the same junk stock answers I ask to be escalated and she instantly says yes and puts me on hold. At this point I get connected to Kerry who tells me all she can do is refund the amount of the return flight and she's not sure how much that would be. She also can offer me 1200 AA miles as additional compensation and we do some verbal dancing as I try to get her to admit that 1200 miles doesn't cover the cost difference.

&#x200B;

M: ""So if we had stayed until Tuesday how much would ya'll have given us for hotels?"" 

K: ""They can only do that at the local airport I'm not sure what they could offer for hotel compensation."" 

M: ""What about credit with the airline for cost difference in getting on this Delta flight?"" 

K: ""I don't have an answer for that. You can contact our customer service department but they're not open today.""

M: ""You can't connect me to that department or someone who can help figure out the compensation? Our new flight total is $2348.6 so I can get home on the day I was supposed to. My patients would have to wait or see someone else (risking losing patients), my wife is in the same boat at the practice she works at (and I'm sure her boss would love cancelling a full day), and I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. Give me as much of a refund as you can and then give me credit with AA for the cost difference and we're good.""

K: ""No, and there is no one else to escalate to.""

M: ""How do I get a hold of the customer service department?""

K: ""Look on our webpage and email them or you can write a letter.""

Yes, this is American's solution to a problem they created. No proper compensation, write us a letter. Obviously it's defer until the customer gives up. At this point I did something I shouldn't have but at some point I think an employee should consider their existence given what she does for a living. I didn't cuss, I wasn't rude, and I didn't yell.

M: ""What's your name?""

K: ""Kerry.""

M: ""Kerry, I haven't flown with another airline in the past 3 years. I don't buy through third party companies only direct through AA. I have status - which doesn't matter but at least shows I fly enough with AA - and I know lots of people have countless more miles, flights, and amounts spent with American. But clearly I've been a good customer with brand loyalty. Why did I have to find a solution to a problem with your company and why will no one on ya'lls end help compensate me or figure out why this flight isn't an option on your side? I'm not asking for anything ridiculous. But when I walked to Delta she got me on the first available flight even though we have to go to another airport.  I said I'm willing to take flights starting or landing at other airports then drive. And no option besides Tuesday until I mention other airlines show availability? Why would I ever fly with American again after this experience? And more importantly why would you spend your life working for a company that treats loyal customers like this?""

A few moment of silence from Kerry. Then a response.

K: ""I'm not sure what customer service will say when you get a hold of them. Send an email and keep all your receipts and records. I can refund the cost of the flight and then you can try to get them to help make up the difference. I'm not saying they will do the full amount but they should at least do something.""

M: ""And if I let you cancel my return does that form some binding agreement that ya'll owe me nothing?""

K: ""No, but you'll have to work out the difference with them.""

&#x200B;

So, I know this isn't a unique experience to anyone who has flown. The United States is notorious for being unhelpful with flight cancellations. But the fact that there were other flights available and American wouldn't work to find some middle ground doesn't sit well with me. Why did I have to find a reasonable solution and why would no one - of the 5 people I spoke at the airport and on the phone - try to figure out a reasonable middle ground? Like I told Kerry, I like American.  Generally it's a good experience and simple. But when shit hits the fan why do all of their employees just duck an cover instead of trying to figure out a reasonable fix? Why did the lady at the airport tell me there was nothing until Tuesday then admit she at least had Monday morning if we looked at other airlines? 

&#x200B;

Anyone have tips on how to handle customer service once I email them? I currently have 3 flights for 2 people booked for San Fran, Seattle, and Hawaii later this year. But honestly if they tell me to pound sand I think I'd rather give another airline a try and cancel those flights (I put trip insurance on them). Or even consider just using third party and looking for the best deals going forward. We've been using the American Executive card for both my business and personal but I'd probably switch cards too so does anyone have ones they recommend trying out for flights/travel?

We have large duffle bags that we love to travel with because they hold everything we could possibly need. We've never taken them flying but we are going to be gone for 2 weeks and would love to use them and avoid purchasing new luggage. 

The question is, with hard luggage you get the dimensions. Max allowable size without the 200 dollar fee is 62inches. With our duffle bags we measure 63 inches if it's filled to capacity. They are not meaning the height of the bag compresses and makes the total size about 60 inches. Does that matter? 

As far as I'm concerned if the luggage compresses that saves space and it shouldn't be measured as if there is stuff in it. But also don't want to pay 200 dollars per bag both ways.

I have 2 Record Locators and am totally confused,2,c4pq49,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/c4pq49/i_have_2_record_locators_and_am_totally_confused/,6,"So, I got a fare alert a few months ago for the equivalent of Basic Economy PHL-VCE on Finnair's website. I bought the ticket there and discovered that it was actually an AA flight. While on the Finnair site, I also bought the first leg of our flight from RDU to PHL, so that it would all be on the same ticket. When I got to the part to pay to choose my seats, it wouldn't let me. Hmpf.

So then I used the Finnair reservation number to find my flight on AA's website. Logged in as my wife, who is Platinum, and found the reservation, but it was listed as 2 separate reservations for each leg. For the international part (I guess the ""Finnair"" part, although it is AA metal) I was then able to not only choose MCE seats, but also didn't get charged for them. Cool! But for the RDU-PHL part I had to pay for seats. Weird but okay.

But the confusing thing is that the AA record locator for the RDU-PHL ticket also includes the PHL-VCE leg, but shows no seats selected for PHL-VCE. But it also lists a separate record locator for that flight as well, and that one DOES have our MCE seats selected. So there's basically a redundancy of having the PHL-VCE leg on both record locators, one with seats selected and one without.

OK, so here's my dilemma: I definitely don't want to lose my pre-selected seats for the overseas portion, so even though the online check-in for that flight is later, I'm thinking that I should wait until exactly 24 hours before the overseas flight and check in FIRST with that Record Locator to ensure that either a) I have my seats or b) have enough time to select seats before they're all taken in case my seats ""disappear""

I feel like if I first check in to the RDU-PHL flight, which also shows the PHL-VCE flight in the itinerary, as mentioned above, that it will then somehow cancel out my overseas seats and make me pay/select them.

Anybody have any experience with this? I would just call AA and try to straighten this out, but I'd rather not either lose my nice MCE seats for the long flight or have to pay a lot of money for them when I originally got them for free while logged in as a Platinum passenger.

I have the printouts for both flights, which say ""Ticketed"" and have the seats assigned, so I'm hoping I can show the FA that if something goes sideways during this process, but that may not be enough. They may say, ""You got lucky because of a glitch in the codeshare system and can't benefit from that.""

Anyway, any advice would be appreciated! We're flying as a family, so I really don't want to lose the seats we have together.",1561418558.0
How to Maximize American Airlines Experience,1,c4dfaj,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/c4dfaj/how_to_maximize_american_airlines_experience/,11,"Hi their guys. Like the title says, I recently got a promotion at work (yay!) and it will involve a lot of travel. Specifically I'll be traveling Monday-Thursday from Dallas to a minor East coast city. This travel schedule will most likely keep up through the end of the year, and next year they could place me on projects anywhere else in the country. I had a travel role my first year out of college and was really on top of my points and rewards programs. Here are my current rewards programs and what I have saved up:

Southwest Rapid Rewards: 35k points

American Airlines AAdvantage: 4.6k miles

Hertz Gold Plus Rewards: President's Circle w/ 500 points (Status matched from National after my company stopped using National)

Hilton HHonors: Blue Level 120k points

Chase Ultimate Rewards: 225K points (Worth 1.5x more when redeemed for travel.)

I used to travel a lot, but I've pretty much lost status with all the rewards programs outside of Hertz. My preference in the past was Southwest Airlines, but my goal is to save up points for international travel, which Southwest unfortunately doesn't offer at this time. I have done some research and decided that I want to switch over to American Airlines. Dallas is a major hub and I can get nonstop flights to almost every city from here. I want to understand what I can do to maximize my experience and points with American Airlines. 

For those wondering about credit cards, I have 4 accounts currently open:

Capital One Journey Card (Got this in college to build credit Dec 2016) Limit: $1800

Chase Sapphire Reserve (Jan. 2018) Limit: $26k

Chase Freedom Unlimited (July 2018) Limit: $11k

Chase Freedom (May 2019) Limit: $7k 

I have never missed a payment and have always paid my balance in full outside of a few stressful months in college and when I took a major vacation with my family. My credit score has hovered around 760 until I opened up the Chase Freedom in May. (Currently around 740)

What are your recommendations so I can take advantage of my new role and maximize the points I am getting back as well as maximizing my experience? Thanks!",1561357950.0

I'm not ashamed of my size, but I would be very ashamed if we had to depart the plane because of the seatbelt not fitting.

The bigger issue is that many of the 'elite' agents on the Exec Platinum/Platinum Pro desk have no idea how their own process works.  I'd say about 33% of the time the agent tells me that there are no confirmed SDFCs available.  After talking to a more experienced agent, I learned this was because they have to pull my upgrade in order to process the SDFC to coach (And put me back on Upgrade List).

&#x200B;

Not once have I ever been able to convince an agent that this is what is happening.  They throw around words like load factor but every single time I 'm able to hang up, call back, and get a more experienced agent who processes the change.  I get that no one wants someone to tell you how to do your job, but in this instance I seem to know more about this extremely simple process (Which could be covered with a bullet point in training - what the fuck AA?) than they do.

&#x200B;

It's really bad when there is weather across the country and the wait times stretch into hours - I've been unable to change flights because the first agent can't do their job and I don't have time to get anyone else on the phone before the flight/it's already late at night and I don't want to hop on a call at 3a just to get another inexperienced agent.

&#x200B;

Anyone else run into this issue?  It happened to me this Sunday and I finally submitted a formal complaint, but since it's been going on for years I assume AA won't do anything.  The only thing I can think to do is ask for a supervisor after the second/third agent clears the SDFC, and then have them put a note in the file of the original agent.",1560403401.0
Questions for AA road warriors,1,bzyj6x,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/bzyj6x/questions_for_aa_road_warriors/,8,"My wife has now become the family road warrior & is now flying from DFW to DCA about 15-18 times a year.  

I’m trying to figure out a way to improve her status via an American CC. (Unfortunately the owner of her company loves his rewards points & doesn’t want her using a card in her name to pay for the tickets)

(FYI - she was a big fan of Virgin American...Alaska....before they gave up their gates, so she’s only been an American high volume since Alaska stopped DCA to DFW late last year)

She’ll hit gold status with her next flight. EQD’s is blown out, but she’s still about 1000 EQM’s short of 25k.

I’m looking at signing her up for either the Citi Platinum Select or Advantage Executive Card. 

Questions:

Do the reward miles from the CC’s count as EQM’s??  If they don’t, then getting a card really doesn’t help & I’ve wasted everyone’s time.  If they do, then in theory she’ll bump up to Platinum Pro after the 3-month period. (She’ll hit EQD’s no problem). Then she’ll have status for all of 2020 & the 80% bonus just might keep here there beyond 2020.

Assuming I get her the card (I know, she gets her own card...) is the Admirals Club in DC worth the $450 a year?  I know DCA gets crowded. She’d also have access at DFW too, however she does have a favorite bar for a pre flight meal.

Does it help going to the Admirals club when you have cancellations or delays...avoid the chaos in the terminal????

TIA for your help.",1560411738.0

I am trying my hardest to earn EP this year going so far as flying through Miami and Dallas for my layover. I also am fortunate to be getting married this year and had booked a honeymoon flight to Bali through American Express.

*This was their initial email to explain what started the whole string of delays, they're basically taking responsibility for the whole thing:* 

**May 19, 2019**

**Hello:**

**We are writing to follow up with you about the situation you encountered as a passenger on our flight 1720 on May 18, 2019. Due to a delay in the flight arriving into Montego Bay, our flight crew would have exceed the maximum number of hours they could remain on duty prior to arriving in Philadelphia. With no other alternative, we made the decision for the flight to make a stop in Miami, where another crew could continue to Philadelphia. Although we would have preferred to replace the crew before leaving Montego Bay, so that the flight could continue nonstop, we did not have a ""spare"" crew available.**

**Subsequently, we also had an unexpected maintenance item arise causing a further delay in Miami. While our agents worked hard to minimize the inconvenience, we know that many of our customers' important plans were significantly disrupted. I am truly sorry.**

**In appreciation for your patience, we'd like to send you 15,000 AAdvantage® miles, however we need your AAdvantage account number. Simply reply back to this email with your account number and we'll add the miles for you.**

**Not an AAdvantage member? Sign up for an account at** [**https://www.aa.com/goto/quick-enrollment**](https://www.aa.com/goto/quick-enrollment)**. After your account has been successfully created, reply back to this email with your account number and we'll add the miles for you.**

**Upon review of the circumstances, we are reminded that our responsibility to provide our customers with quality service is a major priority, one that we can't afford to overlook. Please be assured that we'll do our best to provide a smooth trip the next time you fly with us. We will look forward to the opportunity.**

*This is my email to AA's customer relations:*  

**I was part of a party of 15 flying home from MBJ. Our flight was scheduled for 2:37pm 5/18. We left the resort at 10:55a. I rec'd a text that 1720 was delayed from 2:37p to 3:45p with more texts delaying the flight to 5p, then 6:15p, then a text we will miss our connecting flight in PHL and it was rebooked on AA4879 to depart (5/19) at 1:35p. 1720 was delayed until 7:20p, then 7:45p, then 8:20p, again until 9p, then 9:15p and all of these delays were caused by lack of crew. A flight arrived with a crew that was about to work over the 24hr allotment, so we were rushed onto a different plane to the MIA airport since customs was no longer open in PHL. We arrived in MIA at 12:15am 5/19 and we were told that we will not be going to PHL until 6am 5/19 and that it was too late to get us a hotel and that we would be spending the night in the airport, with no blankets or pillows. Flight from MIA to PHL scheduled for 6am 5/19 flight 1720. We all got on the plane and rec'd notification that the flight was delayed until 6:30am, then 6:45a, then 7a, then 7:30a, and after being delayed until 8:30a, was asked to get off plane and take all belongings and would have breakfast sandwiches supplied (which was soggy lunch meat sandwiches at 8:30 in the morning). After being delayed until 9a, the flight was delayed until 3p so we now missed our flight AA4879 out of PHL at 1:35pm 5/19 and was told that they had no flight out of PHL to BUF until Tuesday 5/21. We finally asked to be rebooked to flight 1670 out of RSW at 5:18p. Rented a car, drove 2½ hrs to RSW, 1670 delayed until 6pm. Arrived PHL at 9:20pm and ran to flight 4366, delayed for 2 hrs arrived in SYR at 1a. My husband drove 3 hrs each way to pick us up from SYR to BUF. I spent money on food while delayed, my husband and I missed work 5/20, I missed work on 5/21. Missed a show on 5/20. 42 hours no sleep or shower. Terrible ending to our vacation because of AA not having enough crew to get us home on time.**

**Thank you for writing in to Customer Relations. My**

**After reading your comments, it is painfully clear that we simply ""dropped the ball"" on this occasion. We are disappointed that things did not go as smoothly as we both would have preferred. At the same time, we are glad you took the time to let us know what happened. It gives us an opportunity to improve our service.**

**Mrs., we hope you will give us another chance to provide you with the kind of service you have every right to expect from us. We are continually refining our products and services to make every aspect of your travels with us as convenient and pleasant as possible. Please know that we are continuously striving to provide the best level of service possible.**

**We would like to be sure that you fly with us again soon, and we have made arrangements for a $175 eVoucher (via a separate email) for you to use toward the purchase of a ticket to travel with us.**

**Mrs., when you settle into your seat next time, we are confident that your experience will be more enjoyable than the one you described in your correspondence.**

**Sincerely,**

&#x200B;

*My reply to that:*  

**I am out way more than a $175 voucher will cover.** 

**I lost a day by not taking off at my scheduled time and getting home before midnight on 5/18. I had to purchase food and drinks while our flight was delayed, I had to add stress to my life after a wonderful and stress free vacation. I had to take a red-eye flight to Miami and sleep on garbage bags on the floor of the airport. I had to get my hopes up that I might make it to PHL on time to make my connection to get home Sunday afternoon to only board and be delayed numerous times and then get deboarded and delayed again. I had to take it upon myself to rebook another flight to get me to PHL by renting a car and driving 3 hours to another airport to only be delayed once again in RSW and then delayed AGAIN in PHL to SYR and not getting in until almost 1am 5/20. My husband had to drive almost 3 hours to pick me up at an airport that I wasn't even supposed to be at and then drive us 3 hours home getting home at 3:30am. I missed a day of work on 5/20 and my husband missed his work day as well on 5/20. I missed a musical show that I was supposed to take my daughter to in the evening of 5/19. My luggage didn't arrive in BUF until 5/21. I figure that I am out a day of my life, unexpected food and beverage purchases, rental car charges and fuel, my husband's time to pick us up, mileage on our car and fuel as well, a day's pay for each myself and my husband, and then we had to go and pick up my luggage.** 

**$175 isn't going to even come close to what I lost.** 

&#x200B;

Their reply basically telling me to go pound salt: 

**June 2, 2019**

**Hello Mrs.:**

**Thanks for writing us back. I'm sorry to hear you are not satisfied with the complimentary voucher we provided.**

**The voucher was intended to make up for the inadequate service you experienced. Our goodwill represents an amount we believe to be fair and reasonable considering the circumstance you described. I'm happy to consider any other details you'd like to provide.**

**Mrs., all of the terms and conditions of a nonrefundable ticket are fully disclosed prior to purchasing the ticket. We require that each customer acknowledge and agree to the terms. By agreeing, you state that you have fully acknowledged and are aware of the rules that surround the ticket you are purchasing. One of the terms states that American Airlines is not liable for out of pocket expenses that one may incur when we do not operate flights according to schedule. I am sorry. Nevertheless, you have my assurance that we will continue to focus on the on time departure of our flights and our customer service standards.**

**Mrs., I know you didn't have the best experience traveling with us recently. I do hope that you give American Airlines another try.**

**Sincerely,**

  

*And I’ll reply until the end of time:* 

**You have the list of expenses that I incurred during the series of delays. You have heard my horror story about sleeping on floors and not showering while stuck in various airports. Renting cars and driving hours to other airports to get home quicker. My husband driving 3 hours to get us from an airport that I wasn’t supposed to ever be at. Missing work because of the delays and my husband missing work because after picking us up at the other airport and getting home at 3:30am and all you are offering me is $175? I am out close to $1100 or more if you count the show that I was supposed to take my daughter to that Sunday evening that I wasn’t home for.** 

**This trip was booked through AAA Travel Agency and was amazing until all of these mechanical delays as well as insufficient crew delays. I cannot tell you how disappointed I’ve been thus far with AA’s response to their self created issues.**  

**Please look into this further and put me in contact with someone that can help me get this straightened out.**

Help me understand AA miles awards,3,bufkhk,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/bufkhk/help_me_understand_aa_miles_awards/,5,"I'm looking at the Citi AAdvantage card with 60k bonus miles. I don't often fly AA, but there are maybe four trips per year that I could switch to AA. If my desired flight costs 65k miles roundtrip for two adults, how do I handle the difference?

Would I just use my 60k miles to cover most of the cost and then pay for the rest? Would I have to book two different reservations (one with 32.5k miles, the other with cash)? Would I have to purchase miles outright? Would I have to wait until I have enough miles?",1559170039.0

JFK Transfer Time/Lounge Access,2,bi9mte,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/bi9mte/jfk_transfer_timelounge_access/,3,"HI all,

&#x200B;

Already have a post regarding this trip and which seat is best but was just wondering a few things regarding my upcoming trip. 

MVD-GRU-JFK-YYZ 

Ticket bought with LATAM but GRU to YYZ through JFK operated by AA in J and I'm a BA Silver (OneWorld Sapphire Holder). 

I've been reading around a bit regarding connection time from my International Longhaul Flight to my Canada flight (in an ERJ) and had a few questions. 

1. My stated layover time on my ticket is of around 2 hours and 40 minutes. I've flown in/out of JFK once a few years ago and remember it being hellishly slow at getting planes in/out due to the amount of traffic and so I'd assume that there would be a delay in getting into JFK. My question about the layover, is whether 2 hours and 40 minutes is enough, and what processes I would have to go to (I've never connected at a US airport, only done European ones where there isn't passport control etc, don't have to collect luggage and re-check-in etc. but I've heard that sometimes they make people do that?) Would be nice if someone could clarify this for me. - Ticket was bought as a whole one-way ticket. 
2. If by chance 2 hours and 40 minutes is enough, is there a specific lounge that I should head for within the JFK terminal - Apart from OW Sapphire I also have Priority Pass and AMEX Platinum (only been to the Centurion lounge in Buenos Aires). - I know I have access to the AA one because of status and Biz/J class ticket but wondering if there was a lesser known one that was just as good/better etc (again, if I have the time). 

Appreciate any help/advice and responses and happy to clarify anything if necessary!",1556473460.0

737-800 vs 737 MAX: What am I flying?,14,bax0ph,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/bax0ph/737800_vs_737_max_what_am_i_flying/,8,"With the recent grounding of aircraft and influx of people asking if their flight is effected, here is a little guide to know if you are flying the 737-800 (Next Generation) or the 737 MAX

While yes, the MAX is currently grounded for safety issues, the FAA and AA will not put passengers on an aircraft without proving the aircraft is airworthy and safe to fly.

**See this image for reference:**

https://i.imgur.com/VX8bySl.jpg


Difference 1: Engine and Cowl (Green Circle)

* 737 MAX's engine features noise reducing cheverons (the pointy bits at the back) and is much larger than the 737-800's engine.

* 737-800's engine has a flat ended cowl and is much smaller.

Difference 2: Winglets (Red Circle)

* With out a doubt the most noticible difference between the 737-800 and 737 MAX is the addition of a lower winglet.  The 737 MAX has both an upper and lower winglet for improved fuel effeciency.

* The 737-800 only has the upper winglet, which blends with the wing in a smooth transition.  The MAX's winglet forms more of an angle.

Difference 3: The APU exhaust (Blue Circle)

* The APU exhaust on the 737-800 appears flatter and is in grey paint.  It looks almost like a screwdirver tip from certain angles.

* The APU exhaust on the MAX comes to an almost point and looks like a rounder funnel.  It does not have paint, and is instead a brownish grey metal.

**I am concerned I am on a 737 MAX, what should I do?**

Check your reservation.  Your itenary should state the type of aircraft that is being used.  If you still have questions, call reservations.  To my knowledge, the MAX is not bookable ATM.

**I've been flying the 737 for years, why is this a problem now?**

The 737-800 has been in service with airlines begining back in 1998 and has been in production since then.  The 737 MAX first flew in 2016 and is the newest generation. The original 737 first flew back in 1967.  While teething issues with new aircraft is not uncommon, it the severity of the current issue is.  That's why the FAA has grounded the aircraft until it can be proven airworthy again.

**Would you fly the 737 Max when it returns to service?**

With out a doubt.  I have flown it a few times already.  I do not think it is an inherently unsafe aircraft.  The correct authorities will do all they can do before putting the aircraft back into service.

\* I do not represent American Airlines in any matter.  This discussion is purely to educate prosepective customers about current events related to the 737 MAX as a whole.",1554775528.0

Fly American or stay with JetBlue?,4,bajuqk,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/bajuqk/fly_american_or_stay_with_jetblue/,28,"Most of my domestic flights in the past few years have been via JetBlue. I've done at least 50-60 JB legs, and they've been almost universally pleasant, with professional, friendly flight attendants, 2-2 seating that guarantees no middle seat, and I have never had trouble getting the seat I wanted or getting my overhead on.

But I recently moved to a nearby city where American and Southwest are the only choices, unless go back into Boston to continue taking JB. So I gave them a try this last weekend. I even bought their credit card so that I could at least be in Group 5 boarding. 

My experience was ok but I was really put off by how bad their flight attendants are in comparison to what I'm used to. One example was on today's flight home, when I was taking a nap and ignoring the peanut/pretzel bag handouts. Suddenly I felt something plop into my lap. The FA had DROPPED the food on top  of me. I handed it back and later pointed out how inappropriate that was, and her response was that most people appreciate it. (?!) 

And although I got my carry-on aboard ok, being in group 5, I noticed that they started closing the bins when they were half-full, and didn't let the last few groups take anything on that would go in the overhead. Some people got really upset and angry about this, and there didn't seem to be any good reason for it, as there was plenty of overhead space despite the full flights.

I sat in the back of the plane, though I did manage to get aisle seats. It didn't seem like there were options for sitting up front without paying extra.

Are all these things typical? With the constant pitches for paying extra for better seats, or priority boarding, and then a long plea for passengers to sign up for their credit card, it seemed like upselling was far more important than good customer service.

Flying AA first time in December,3,badzbh,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/badzbh/flying_aa_first_time_in_december/,5,"Hi all, as title says, I'm flying AA for the first time with a LATAM codeshare. Doing MVD-GRU-JFK-YUZ in business and had a few questions about the legs operated by AA (GRU-JFK-YYZ). The tickets were purchased with LATAM but 2/3 flights are operated by AA. 

The 77W which operates the GRU-JFK has a seat map available and all the seats bar the ones next to the toilets are pretty much the same. 

But in the JFK-YYZ flight it's on an ERJ which I've never flown before and I'm allowed to pick any seat, including the Main Cabin Extra or the preferred. The AA website says that the Main Cabin Extra has priority boarding and has included food and drinks (my current seat selection) and that the preferred doesn't. 

Just wanted to know what seat was the best for the JFK-YYZ flight and whether it made much of a difference

Question about reimbursement,2,b9mfym,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/b9mfym/question_about_reimbursement/,2,"This may be a stretch but I’m hoping someone could explain this to me! I genuinely don’t understand a lot about airlines, so I’m sorry if this is dumb. 

TL/DR I think I’m being screwed on a refund for a connecting flight? 

My dad and had flights from Guatemala to Shreveport in March (about $650 each). We arrived in Dallas (4 hour layover) and received a notification that our flight to Shreveport was cancelled due to weather. After going straight to the help desk, we waited in line for about 30 minutes. When we finally talked to the lady (who was rather unpleasant and even more unhelpful, but I understand it was a chaotic day) she said the soonest she could get us on a flight back to Shreveport would be in two days, and of course they don’t reimburse for hotels with weather-related cancellations. 

My dad is a doctor and had to be on call starting the next morning, so we were desperate enough to rent a car and drive the 4 hours back to Shreveport. The car rental was outrageous (almost $500 after we sprung for the protection plan), but I had looked up the cost of an AA flight to Shreveport and it said it was $250, so I figured we could use our reimbursements to cover the rental car when it came time to pay my credit card bill. 

We got the refund claim handled a few days later and everything went smoothly, but I received an email from AA saying that our reimbursements would be $67 for each of us ($134 total). 

Now we’re left to pay the remains $300+ from the car rental ourselves. I’m sure it has something to do with the fact that we took the connecting flight from Guatemala, and we have no way to prove the value of our flight to Shreveport, since the receipt is technically for a flight to Guatemala. 

Is this really how it works with connecting flights? Does anyone have any experience with this?",1554464867.0

Itineraries from São Paolo to Canada without connecting stateside,0,b6t51n,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/b6t51n/itineraries_from_são_paolo_to_canada_without/,9,"This is an unusual logistics question I was hoping someone could help me out with.

Very briefly: I have a friend who works at AA who can get a mutual friend free tickets on the airline (but not partner airlines). We are trying to get the mutual friend from São Paulo, Brazil to pretty much anywhere in Canada, ideally Montréal or (less ideally) Toronto — but really, just Canada would be great. Here's the difficult restriction: *the flights cannot transfer in the States*. It's a long story, but basically this friend is a Brazilian national and cannot get an American visa, and an American visa is required to even transfer in the States.

It doesn't matter how many transfers there are or how convoluted the flightplan is. Well, within reason — three transfers in Latin America are fine if need be, but even for free, flying from Brazil to London just to transfer back to Montréal doesn't make any sense. So, I guess the only other restriction apart from no American ports would be, let's stay within North, Central, and South America.

I've been at it for close to an hour inputting various cities to other various cities, and haven't had any luck. I'm hoping someone more familiar with AA's cities served might have an idea of where to go.

We booked a return flight from DFW Airport for a 1015 pm flight tonight (3/13/19) yesterday (24 hours ago). We had tried to go online (American airlines in our itenerary) to check in and we get an error message saying we can't check in. With no luck we ignore it and head to the airport tonight. We showed up around 830 to return our rental car. We arrive and chat with a rental car person (advantage rental cars) who tells us we need to go to a gate nearby. We head over and nearing the gate an Airport security guy waves. We roll down the window and he says to wait until someone opens a gate so we can go to the correct drop off location. We wait 20 mins. I get out and ask him. He says just wait. This continues until around 920. Finally I go find another guy who helps us and we return the car. It's now 930 and we're on a shuttle. We get to the counter around 940 and the American airlines rep says the status is too far along and we can't check in. We can't check in online either. I ask if they can call someone or escalate. They call someone and tell me they can't do anything. I ask to escalate to a manager. They say they're calling them (spoiler alert we sat for 45 mins and that person left and no manager showed up). We ask if they could cover a hotel and rental car. They say no as it's the airports fault and they are the airlines (the check in issue is with the airlines but the delay is on the airport imo). I ask if there's someone at the airport I can chat with and they say no you just go online (somewhere) to complain. Turns out the flight was also delayed 45 mins (to add insult to injury). They give us a boarding pass for tomorrow afternoon that ""we might get into if someone cancels."" now we're sleeping at the airport and hoping we get a flight. We also have a 10 month old baby which makes it tough. So American airlines is the worst (didn't allow us to check in, escalate the situation to help us, or give us a place to stay) and the airport security is terrible at DFW and caused us to miss a flight that we were ready for 2 hours in advance.

Hope we get into a flight tomorrow and that the airport is decent for sleeping. End rant.

Pathetic experience,0,azkbt7,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/azkbt7/pathetic_experience/,9,"
Here is a complaint i wrote to american airlines.

The response i got from customer service was:

1) the flight attendent has the authority to do whatever they want.   

2)  ""sir--i wasnt on the flight so i have no idea why they would do that.""

No attempt at a recovery.   

Here is the complaint:

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction during a recent flight. 


I boarded the plane and i was seated in the last row middle seat.   


Luckiy, no one ended up sitting in the aisle seat, so i moved over so that I, and the person seated at the window could have some additional room.


Suddenly, a flight attended approached myself and the woman in the aisle pre flight with me and instructed us that we had to move to the emergency exit row.   


Mind you, i did not request this, nor did i want this, i was happy with my seat.   


As i approached my new seat, i noticed two things:


1)  there were already two people sitting in the emergency exit row, making it full. 


2) in my row, which was actually behind the emergency exit row, there were already 2 people seated.  


On the other side of the aisle, same thing.   


So basically, we have 8 people total prior to mysef and the woman i was originally seated with coming up and jammed in the middle seat to assist with the emergency row.   


I thought, well this is odd, but my cynical side was telling me i wasnt moved up for this reason.


I glanced back mid flight and i witnessed a flight attendent sitting in my old row, the last row, which had zero passengers.


I have questions:


How many people are required by law to be in emegency rows?


If the minimum amount was met, why was i moved? 


If you have passengers waiting to fly standby, which there were, why didn't the flight attendents fill the plane?   


Do the flight attdendants have seats of their own?


I think you see where i am going with this.


I am calling bs on your staff.


And not only was thing wrong, but i also sat behing a small child who kicked my seat the entire flight.   


So i went from a potentially peaceful flight to a crammed aggravating seat, bc your crew wanted to spread out. 


I am a regular customer with american airlines as I am local to your hub in Philadelphia.


Typically, i fly about 4 or 5 times a year.   


I am disappointed with your staff and i want know how you plan to make this situation

Four of them have been on American. Last night and today have been the worst.

&#x200B;

We were supposed to board a flight from ORD to MDT at 1649 yesterday with my girlfriend. We are still in ORD as I type this. Our flight was delayed five times, first for mechanical issues and later because ""they couldn't find another pilot."" That last gem was thrown at us at 2145. At 2325 American cancelled the flight. Not because of weather or any other ""act of God"" - because the company failed to plan adequately. Now a plane full of travelers are stuck with the following options:

&#x200B;

1. Wait until tomorrow afternoon at 1530 to (hopefully) make a standby list to ORD
2. Take a flight connecting in Boston and Philadelphia before finally landing in ORD sometime around 2330 tonight (a full 30 hours after our original arrival time)
3. Fly to another close airport and figure out a way to get to ORD on our own

&#x200B;

We have four days off and planned two of those days to visit my aging mother. So far, we have spent one of those days in an airport. Our visit with my mother has been reduced to a few hours because American, in addition to their horrendous service in Chicago, has refused to let us delay our flight out of ORD. I guess they'd rather delay it for us.

&#x200B;

This is NOT the level of service we paid for or expected. We'd have rather risked being violently removed from an overbooked United Flight - at least that guy got more than a ""we apologize for your inconvenience"" from the gate attendant before they went home to their comfortable beds. As it stands, we'll be taking Southwest or Delta whenever we can and we'll cheer happily when the dismal service offered by this airline eventually leads to its bankruptcy and failure.",1552239194.0

Automatic Seat Assignment Good or Bad?: Basic Economy,2,alq30g,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/alq30g/automatic_seat_assignment_good_or_bad_basic/,5,"Hi all- I have a 10 hour flight tomorrow in about 15 hours for AA. I booked basic economy and have the option now to pay to select my seat, or will automatically get assigned one at check in. My question is, does AA automatically give you the *worst* seat available if you don't pay for one of the seats?

&#x200B;

Right now, there at about 7 ""basic seats"" for $12 each, all in the middle, and tons of better options for $118+. I know some airlines will automatically give you the *best* seat if you don't select, and others will give you the worst. I don't really feel like paying $12 if I'm just going to end up with a terrible middle seat anyway and am inclined to wait and see if all 7 of the middle seats get selected to see if I can automatically get assigned a better seat. But I'm not sure if that's a bad idea too. Does anyone have experience with this and can offer their insight? Attaching a seat map for my flight. Thank you

PS I went on to make a fake reservation for a higher ticket level to see if more seats were available for the flight and there were only 2 or 3 ""elite"" or whatever seats that this map didn't show.

Any way to know real reason for cancellation?,0,alqw3j,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/alqw3j/any_way_to_know_real_reason_for_cancellation/,4,"We had an AA cancellation impact a group reservation and the reaccomodation cost the group $1500 to rent a charter bus to get the group to a different airport. I'm trying to find out an accurate reason for cancellation.

The cancelled flight was the early morning DSM to DCA flight on 1/31/2019. The inbound DCA to DSM was cancelled the evening before (1/30/2019).

AA blames ""the weather"" in DSM for the cancellation. DSM was getting some extremely cold temperatures. The problem with that explanation is that Delta operated flights to/from DSM at the same times without incident. And Delta's flights were to/from cities (MSP / DTW) that were even colder than DSM.

The AA planes for the flights that the group was booked on never passed through Chicago where there were a lot of cancellations.

I'm guessing that AA has no liability in this even though I feel like it was their inferior operations compared to Delta that made AA susceptible to weather delays. Anything I'm overlooking? ",1548979214.0

I travel a lot and I mean a lot, for 2019 I am already predicted to take over 50 flights The reason that I created this account is because I am curious if anyone else is experiencing terrible customer service with American Airlines. Last year I took around 20 flights with them. Normally the service isn't great but it isn't bad either. If you sit down and shut up, no one really bothers you. Most of the flights were around 3 hours and I never really had an issue or complaint other than the seats are terrible and you don't have any room(which is everyone's complaint). 

However, after taking several fights in 2019,  I have run into issues from time to time. Normally at least to me other airlines seem to be way more willing to help or at least see what they can do. When it comes to American I feel like I am just dollar sign to them and they are there to keep my money not matter what my issue is. I have had issues scheduling flights, card issues, seat issues, planes to full so they have to cut people (they do offer incentives to take later flights), baggage issues and more. I fly with plenty of other airlines and the only complaint I have is some times we get delayed and the seats suck. 

When I speak/spoke to American Airlines customer service, it feels like I am being read some script that has bold print at the top titled ""NEVER GIVE THE PEASANTS MONEY BACK"" . With all of the issues I have had recently, I have not received a dime of my money. They have not offered any type of incentive or even apologized for causing issues. I actual refused to pay them once because it got so bad. Id rather not go deeper into the issues but I will if necessary.

I bought this [Amazon Basics 20 inch carry on](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Hardside-Spinner-Luggage-20-Inch/dp/B071VG5N9D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) and it states its dimensions are 14.4 x 9.2 x 21.6 inches(with wheels measured). Which is close, but exceeds the 14 inch and the 9 inch dimensions. I'm going to be traveling on a weekday early morning on a small plane, domestic, do you think this would be a problem? In person i've checked the width and it measures 13 inches, but with the little knobs on the sides and the side handle it reaches around 14 inches. I'm not sure if it'll fit in the box that they check measurements in. Just looking at the luggage in person it looks very bulky and the light blue doesn't help make it look slimmer.

Aadvantage vs Delta Medallion,5,aaquuk,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/aaquuk/aadvantage_vs_delta_medallion/,14,"I have been Silver Medallion with Delta for 2018. Due to not flying enough this year I lose that status.
I am starting a new career January 1st and their are much better options with AA. So I will be starting fresh with AA at gold status (did a status match incentive.)

With Delta as silver medallion I was upgraded majority of my flights to at least Comfort + seats, and got lucky with a couple first class seats. Best part was that I did not have to do anything. 24 hours prior to my flight I would be notified if I was upgraded.

Since I am new to AA, I would love some clarification on the aadvantage gold program. From what I gathered, I need to call in each time and request the upgrade but I can only upgrade if I have 500 mile credits. Is this accurate?

And would love to hear feedback as to why you fly with AA over Delta.

I was flying home in late November from NY at 5 pm ET via American Airlines. I got to Charlotte at 7 pm ET and had 2 hour layover before my hour flight home.

After hours of delays and two failed takeoffs, the mechanics determined something in the engine was flooded (it had been raining all day).

We go back to the airport and deplane. The pilot tells us their time is almost up for the day so unless they can find another plane soon, the flight would get cancelled.

Fast forward to 2 am and the flight gets cancelled.

They tell us to go to AA customer service, who tells me the quickest they can get me out is on a flight at 10 pm the next night! The guy in front of me got the last morning flight. 

Okay fine..nothing I can do about it...so I ask about the hotel situation. They tell me they are out of hotel vouchers but I can go get my own for two nights (the rest of that night and the next day) which makes sense and submit for reimbursement on the website. 

I go track down my checked bag and start calling hotels. On the sixth try, I find one that doesn’t have a shuttle. I take an Uber there and check in for a rate of 235 a night.

I stay there until I Uber to the airport the next night for my flight, which inevitable got delayed again. I finally got home after being stuck in Charlotte for 30 hours.

So I submitted my reimbursement on the website and their customer relations answered back stating that they only reimburse 120 maximum for one night maximum?!? What?!? So I’m out of pocket almost 400 dollars because their plane failed and they ran out of vouchers? I didn’t even submit for extra transportation, food and/or mention the fact I missed a day of work.

Mainly just venting I guess, but a number of my family members have vouched to cancel their AA cards and transfer their balances. It’s not even so much about the money (which does suck) as it is the principle.

My family and another family purchased tickets from Montreal to St Maarten leaving February 27 and returning March 10. I selected the flight based on two criteria: overall flight duration and price. AA had the best of both criteria.

Originally, we we were transiting in Philly in both directions. Now, we are going through Miami on the way (no problem there), but the way back is our problem. AA seems to have cancelled their 9:00 pm flight from Philly to Montreal. So the notification has us arriving in Philly about an hour after our connecting flight to Montreal leaves. I looked at all options, including transiting through a different airport, doing mutiple legs out of Philly, but it seems to be impossible to get to Montreal on the same day we leave St Maarten. It may be obvious, but we chose the flight because we all go back to work and school on Monday. Maybe less obvious is we chose St Maarten based on this flight: decent price short duration.

The other family contacted AA and they offered to send us through Miami instead of Philly, but we still have to overnight. They said our other option is to cancel, but where does that leave us? The other flight that would get us home on Sunday is much more expensive. 

Is it unreasonable to expect, at a minimum, that AA pay for the hotel that we must stay in on our trip home? This is not just an inconvenience, it has a material impact on our finances, person-days of missed work, food costs, hotel etc...

Woke up at 2am to get to the airport. Found my car doors frozen shut, with nothing on me to free them up! I waited for 2 hours in 9 degree weather for AAA to bring me de-icer which worked in seconds. Missed my 5:25am flight by only a few minutes due to a long security line. Paid an additional fee to get on the next flight and waited another 2.5 hrs in the airport. This probably sounds like a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day, but ultimately flight attendant, Josh, (AA #4856) put a smile on my face with his great sense of humor. I have had a rough go of it lately and that was the first time I have genuinely smiled in weeks, and I really needed that! Josh, I hope you see this, or someone who knows you does and expresses my gratitude.

Local airport tells me I should be able to make my connection in PHL because the regional is on its way and should be here shortly. Yet, I see the inbound hasn’t moved from taxing in 15 minutes. 

Then inbound the aircraft misses GPS lock and diverts up to ROC. Again, the ground crew insists the aircraft will be there any moment and other preparatory announcement are made. 

I know more about what’s going on by watching Flight24 than the AA staff do. 

I then get notices that we will depart an hour from now - never mind that the ROC bound aircraft hasn’t even landed in ROC yet.

American Airlines Stolen Item,4,9qihra,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/9qihra/american_airlines_stolen_item/,3,"Wondering if anyone else has experienced a stolen item from their bag while flying American Airlines? And if they were able to do anything about it?  

I was flying from Boston to Los Angeles and I checked two bags.  I was traveling with two laptop computers and only one would fit in my carry on luggage, so I put the other in a checked bag (A $2,500 brand new laptop in it's original box).  When I grabbed my bag off the carousel in Los Angeles I immediately noticed something was off with my bag because I had stuffed it full and now it was not as full.  I opened it up to find the box and laptop were missing, but some of the packaging and plastic wrapping were still in the bag.  I went straight over to American Airlines baggage counter and described this situation, and they had me fill out a missing article form.  The woman at the counter was very rude to me and kept telling me that I needed to call corporate to discuss the issue further. I found the LAX police and I described what happened to them and they actually discouraged me from filing a police report saying that I should file with TSA as they would handle an investigation.

After leaving the airport, I filed a claim with the TSA and called AA corporate.  I was initially told that checking a bag with a laptop was not allowed (due to the battery) and was probably removed.  This was straight up inaccurate information, and I continued to ask them what my options where.  After providing me little help/hope, they said that their conditions state they are not liable for anything electronic that is damaged or lost from your bag.  They ended up issuing a $200 voucher for my ""inconvenience"".  

I then filed a claim with the TSA and after several weeks heard back that they had reviewed video of their agent inspecting the bag and that they had taken the laptop out, but put it back in the bag.  When I asked if I could see the video, I was told I needed to file a request through the FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) department.  I did this and have still not heard back after many months.     

After TSA ""resolved"" my claim by saying that they were not at fault, I continued to pursue the claim with American Airlines.  The Customer Baggage Resolution Office  told me that they had submitted my claim to their security investigation department, but they cannot communicate with this department to find out if anything was discovered. They again reiterated that no electronics can be reimbursed as per their policy that I agreed to when purchasing my ticket.  They have told me that when the $200 voucher was issued to me, that my claim was marked as ""resolved""  

I realize that it is not a good idea to place valuable items in a checked bag and I will never do so again, but it doesn't change the fact that I had a $2500 item stolen out of my bag while it was under the supervision of TSA agents or American Airlines employees.  As TSA claims there is video footage proving that their agents placed the laptop back in my bag, I can only assume that an American Airlines employee has stolen the item from my bag.  The AA terms and conditions about not covering customer's electronics items seems to be a loophole for employees to be able to steal these item without any possibly retribution from the customer.  This experience has left me feeling violated, neglected, and disrespected.

Unfortunately, after some incomplete information from their support reps, I just learned today, 1 day prior to my miles expiration, that I am not eligible to earn AA rewards through Hertz because of my corporate discount code that I used to book the rental.

Now I am back to square one. I just signed up for AAdvantage dining because that sounded easy but I just read that it takes 6-8 weeks for those miles to show up in your AAdvantage account.

No records of mechanical repair,1,9bkyrh,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/9bkyrh/no_records_of_mechanical_repair/,4,"Hi Friends, 

At this points it's pretty much become a question for sanity. Back in June when flying out of MEM to BDL I had flight delays. 

Initially we the first plane was late due to weather, we were moved to a new plane. This wasn't a biggie, can't do much about it. While pulling away from the jet bridge we ended up stopping for some time, the pilot told us there were some mechanical failures which required us to go back to the jet bridge. 

I wasn't happy about it. I ended up being six hours late to my destination. The pilot said all they needed to do was sign the paperwork saying the fix had been done and we'd be on our way. I saw the pilot signing something from someone in a yellow vest.

Afterwards I emailed AA and explained I wasn't happy and wanted compensation for this mechanical issue which caused me to lose an entire day of travel. The rep said that Air Traffic Control had grounded the flight, they were referring to the first event. I told them about the mechanical issue, they didn't have record of it. 

How is that possible? Is there any way I can look this information up? I think it's really scary to not have an event that requires mechanical maintenance to go undocumented

Thanks. ",1535674173.0

At the time I needed 346 EQDs, and I booked a trip with a base ticket cost of $604.88 (plus taxes).

(2997/3000 EQDs, 39663/25000 EQMs)  
  
Since I don't think there's a way to call AA and just pay them $3 on a credit card, what is the cheapest possible way to get gold?  Is it hunting for, buying, and then taking a flight?  Or is there any other option that could be cheaper or not require me to actually board?  
  
I'm mostly looking for help instead of just griping, but while I'm posting, let me add that it's frustrating that seat upgrades don't count as EQDs.  My employer might make me book economy, but then I can upgrade my seat to economy plus and expense it, and yet somehow the hundreds I spent on seat upgrades this year don't count toward status even though those dollars probably go more directly to AA's bottom line than the ticket prices.

So, I flew from Columbus to Ft Myers Monday. There was a layover in Charlotte in between. At Columbus, they take my carry on and put a valet tag on it. I get no receipt or tag number. Board the plane, and head to Charlotte.

Charlotte is a mess, there are 4 planes ahead of us on the run way. And once we get off, it's not exactly at a terminal, but outside. And we walk to the terminal. I look for signs of bags on the way, and theres no bags. I think that's fine because they must be inside the actual terminal. I'm freaking out a little because I need to board my next plane in 10 minutes, it's all the way on the other side of the airport, and my medical assistance for my knee injury never showed. 

I get inside the terminal, and theres no bags. Ok. Freak out time. Where's my bag? I ask attendants, and they say it's at the gate you were dropped off at. No it wasn't. I could have waited for the bag, but without assistance showing up, I was already at risk to miss my flight. So I limp to the other side of the airport and make my flight. I asked the attendant at the next gate to call and see if my bag showed up, and it never did. 

Day 5: no bag. My fiance checked columbus airport for me. They took a long time looking in a baggage room for it, but no bag. Charlotte keeps saying they dont have it.

I have big concerns here.

1. I got no receipt. And knowing AA, is there a chance they will reimburse me if they never gave me a receipt for a valet bag? There is no proof. So that right there tells me they're likely going to dismiss my claim
2. I read that they may only reimburse for items you still have the receipt for. These items were purchased a while ago. So if I dont have the receipt, will I not get any money back?

Maybe you can find some help and advice as well! Thank you for your time. 

""Last week I left from Miami to St. Skitts & Nevis, flying American. I visited my then girlfriend, now fiancée, as I proposed to her on the island. She studies at Ross University of Veterinary Medicine so we do the long distance thing, but I digress. I was scheduled to leave Tuesday the 24th of July, but my flight was cancelled. My employer was none too happy about that, but was understanding enough. I immediately booked a flight for the next day, and received a confirmation email, complete with seat number. My reservation was confirmed and booked. I received no further communication from AA that would tip me off to what they were about to do to me.

I arrived at the airport over two hours ahead of time to check in. I tried to check in electronically but the kiosk told me I was too early, and to check in at most 24 hours before my flight.

""Odd, maybe its an error,"" I thought to myself.

I approached an AA employee at the desk and she informed me that the flight was overbooked, and their system automatically booked me for a flight on Saturday the 28th, a full 3 days after my already delayed trip home. My seat was reserved and paid for; then suddenly it wasn't. I pleaded with her to honor American Airlines carriage contract regarding involuntary denial of boarding, which states that employees must attempt to put me on another carrier, or find a person on the flight to volunteer their seat to me. She plainly refused and simply said ""see you on saturday."" She said she was a supervisor and she refused to engage with me further, so I left frustrated and quite frankly fearful. I had to inform my employer that I was going to be another 3 days late. That phone call didn't go well, and it was unclear whether or not I would remain employed upon arrival in Miami.

I immediately placed a call to AA and spoke to a supervisor who explained that the Customer Relations department is the only entity that can issue compensation. They are, as far as I can tell, only reachable by email. Obviously, removing human interaction from complaints is a tactic they use to save money. I wrote an email on Wednesday the 25th, explaining my predicament and humbly requesting compensation with a stipulation to account for the grievous personal cost to me. The following day, I found an open seat on a flight on Friday the 27th. Immediately after landing, I paid a visit to my place of employment, and my manager suspended me indefinitely. I am currently in the process of groveling to him to get my job back, yet it's very uncertain. I know the IATA has rules which pertain to ""involuntary denial of boarding"" but I'm not privy to the legalities involved with that. In terms of monetary cost, I've already missed 4 days of income, not to mention the very likely loss of employment. The personal cost of stress and time/resources spent looking for work should also be taken into account.

Today, AA Customer Relations responds with this shining example of corporate indifference. [https://imgur.com/a/RRJ7kFB](https://imgur.com/a/RRJ7kFB)

I've already submitted another email stating how unacceptable this is to me. I rarely travel as is, and now that I have no income, I absolutely can't take time off to use their stupid voucher. I need help getting through to them; I need them to take responsibility for their employees and their system. How can I get them to take me seriously, and how can I have them cover my expenses beyond the cost of the ticket?

Thank you to whoever takes the time to read this, I'm super frustrated and super broke so any assistance would mean the world to me. Help me reddit, you're my only hope.""",1532837695.0

I'm an American Airlines frequent flyer and I've recently discovered their 'Business Extra' program.   


The Business Extra program is designed for 'lots' of employees to give general credit to a generic account. I work for a small start up that will never amount to 'great benefits' under this program. However, I personally travel quite a bit and I'd like to 'pay it forward' using this program.   


Many times I've heard people say, if I could only afford to fly to X, but I can't because its cost prohibitive. I'd like to 'surprise' some people and 'help them out'. In order to do that, I need others that travel on American Airlines to include my Business Extra Number in their profile and then when I accrue enough points, I'll then offer a ticket to someone in need.    


There are 2 ways you can help make this happen.

1. Future Flights - ADD 948258 to the your Reservation Preferences on your American Airlines account.  Any flights flown will automatically populate into the account and points will be accrued. 
2. Past flights - Any flights flown AFTER March 24, 2018 can still be given credit as if you added to your profile. All I'd need from you is the following:   
\- Date of First Flight on Itinerary  
\- Ticket Number (Starts with 001) If your ticket starts with 125 or 075, those will work also.   
\- Last Name  
\- First Name  
\- Itinerary Origin City (What city did you start your travels)

Please only send via private message.  I'm hoping I can help someone who loses a loved one and can't buy a ticket, or someone who is stuck somewhere and needs to get home. I just want to put this to great use.   


Thanks in advance for your willingness to share and help! Its VERY simple.

7/23/18 Charlotte Delays,1,91asr8,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/91asr8/72318_charlotte_delays/,3,"Anyone get stuck in this mess yesterday? Was trying to get from Louisville to Albany at a reasonable time.

First thing was they couldn't put me on an earlier flight with plenty of seats because their computer system was having issues. I looked at the screen and it was some MS DOS-based program kicking out error messages. 

So finally we board the plane, taxi out and then ""there's going to be a 15-25 minute delay, so we just have to sit here."" Time passes ""Yeah there's going to be an hour and a half delay. We're going back to the gate."" Everyone deplanes.

Finally takeoff like 3 hours later. ""Yeah we can't get the drink tray out due to turbulence."" Flight wasn't even bumpy at all. Finally got a soda.

Arrive in Charlotte at 10:30. Deplane. I notice on the DEPARTURES screen that the Albany flight is delayed and in a different gate. I walk briskly to the gate to see if the plane is actually there (I was ready to stay in Charlotte at this point and was way too tired to run like the other people on my flight decided to do.) 

I get to the gate and see the big ass line of people. Everyone's all pissed off about the delay, naturally. We finally get to board at like 11:10 (flight was scheduled for 10:10.) Every time someone scanned their pass, some computer error came up. I get to the gate, scan my boarding pass (with my phone on 2%!) and it comes up on the PC ""WRONG FLIGHT, DO NOT BOARD!!!"" Somehow their computer moved people from today's flight to tomorrow. Lady does some MS-DOS trickery, runs 50 feet to a printer, and hands me a boarding pass. KTHXBAI.

Get on the plane and everyone's all pissed off that it's taking so long to board. ""THIS IS RIDUCLOUS! OMG PEOPLE ARE STILL BOARDING! WHY CANT WE FLY IN THE RAIN?! BLAHBLAHBLAH \*Checks FaceBook for 100th time\*"" I kept my mouth closed even though I had been at the airport for over 12 hours at this point. Headphones in, entertainment up. Peace out.

We FINALLY take off. ""Yeah, we can't get the drink trays out guys, too turbulent."" Hit probably 10 bumps the whole flight. Lady came by with a soda towards the end, but I preferred my Charlotte water fountain h2o in a Powerade bottle at this point so I declined.

Extortion and Stupidity,0,8ypda7,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/8ypda7/extortion_and_stupidity/,8,"I am flying to a wedding in Texas in a couple months. I got the invitation 10 days ago, and was proactive in booking a flight. I have a bunch of miles that are going to expire in the fall\*, so I decided to book on American to keep my miles. Turns out there was a good deal for a direct flight for $130 the day of the wedding, so I bought with money not miles.

One day later, I discover I have also been invited to the rehearsal dinner the Friday before the wedding. These days, rehearsal dinners often include people not actually in the wedding party, but it seemed very reasonable that I might not have been invited.

As I'm sure many of you are aware, there is a $200 fee to change domestic flights. I was shocked to discover that this applies even when your original flight is less than $200 (you also pay the difference in ticket cost if the new one is more expensive). I noticed a flight for the Friday for $130, so decided to call American to explain to them that if they charge me less than $200 to change the flight, I would be incentivized to cancel my original Saturday reservation but would otherwise have no reason to.

Terry, the representative to whom I spoke, explained that it is $200 to change the flight, so I was better off just booking the Friday flight independently. When I explained to her that I had no incentive to cancel my Saturday flight, she said if someone needs to get home to see their dying mother, I would be taking up a spot on the plane still. Despite my protests, she could not grasp how not lowering the $200 change fee to something reasonable for a $130 ticket would be worse for American Airlines in terms of profit, worse for me in terms of cost, AND worse for the theoretical child of the dying mother.

Let's do some math. Let's say my original flight is X dollars, the change fee is Y dollars, and the new flight is Z dollars. We also assume they can sell my original ticket (still for X dollars) if I change or cancel my reservation with them.

*If I opt to pay the change fee to rebook:*
I pay in total: X (original ticket) + Y (change fee) + (Z (new ticket) - X (credit from original ticket)) = X + Y + Z - X = **Y + Z**
American makes in total: (Y + Z) (what I pay) + X (what replacement passenger ""with dying mother"" pays for my original ticket) = **X + Y + Z**

*If I opt to NOT pay the change fee, and book the new flight while keeping the original reservation out of spite because American is trying to extort money out of me and guilt trip me for taking up reservation for potential passenger with dying mother:*
I pay in total: X (original ticket) + Z (new ticket) = **X + Z**
American makes in total: (X + Z) (what I pay) = **X + Z**

As you can see, American makes my change fee in EXTRA profit if I am incentivized to pay it. Also, potential passenger with dying mother gets a flight to see his dying mother (as Terry guilt tripped me about). In short, the change fee should NEVER EVER be more than cost of the original flight, and really should be some fraction of the cost of the original flight to incentivize me to actually cancel it. Terry was not able to grasp this concept on the phone, although she was happy to suggest that it was my fault, not American Airlines', that someone wouldn't be able to book a spot on the Saturday flight.

Writing this is helping me calm down, so thank you reddit, but I am still furious with American Airlines for being bad at capitalism and failing to recognize a situation where we could have worked together to save everyone money and make everyone happier. In they end, I'm sure they hoped I'd warn others about not making a booking you might change later, but instead I'm here to suggest you book on a different airline entirely next time. JetBlue has better flights, is a nicer flying experience, AND only charges $75 for flight changes. Better all around.

TL;DR
In short, American Airlines made me angry, cost me money, lost money for themselves, AND prevented a potential passenger from flying on their flight, despite guilt tripping me about that exact thing. They fail at capitalism and customer service. Fly JetBlue.

*Funny thing about the miles is that they extorted me out of $100 a few years ago because they expired. I had to pay $100 just to keep this stupid miles that have been so useless, I haven't used them in the last two years. So, my last two experiences with American have involved them trying to extort more money from me despite not providing me with any transportation.

 They began by offering $600, then $800 to anyone that would give up a seat. Before I boarded it was at $900. 

If all the seats weren’t given up, they were gong to cancel the flight, provide meal money and a hotel for every booked customer until 0815 flight the next day.

I had to board, so no idea what the result was. From Ronald Regan btw.",1529898897.0

No-show on a stopover,1,8t0a21,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/8t0a21/noshow_on_a_stopover/,3,"Hi there,

I have a flight BCN-ORD-LGA (and the other way round for the return flight) without checked baggage. I would like to know if I can do a ""no-show"" in the second flight (ORD-LGA) without loose the return flight. I know that if you don't take the outbound flight the company cancels the return flight. But in this case, I would be missing half of the outbound flight.

And I case that I could, how it would look to the authorities? A foreigner coming to NY that don't take the second flight. Maybe they think I'm trying to hide my location...

To put you in context, I found a super cheap flight to NY so I bought it. But I've been ion NY twice, so I'm thinking to use my time to visit other cities and then go to NY to come back home.

Thanks!

After re-booking we got a flight at 7:00 AM the next morning. Keep in mind there are 3 people traveling together. When re-booking we were offered ONLY $125 to cover hotel fees for 3 people and with 2 hotels to choose from, one for $111 and the other for well over $400. We booked the cheaper of the 2 hotels and got a cab to the hotel which we paid over $30 for!! Only to find out that the hotel that we looked at didn't have any more rooms to give us. Then had to spend another $30 to get back to the airport and get our bags and get a rental car and just drive. We waited 2 hours for our bags only to find out that our bags were on a flight to NYC without us. We asked 2 different people if there were any flights that we could take and both said that we would have to wait until the morning but someone our bags made it NYC without us. So at this point, we have wasted $60 and have wasted all of our time to be able to go and eat because everything is closed along with the rental car services.

As we separated, I got the cell phone number of their escort so that I would know when the kids were safely boarded and the plane departed.  Waited at the airport till departure time, got no call.  Sent a text message to escort and was advised that the kids were onboard, the plane was locked and taxiing for takeoff.  Went to the checkin desk and asked if I should leave.  Was told yes.
Unbeknownst to me, received an email at exactly the same time advising that the flight would be delayed another hour.  Saw this email during my trip home and panicked.  Checked the AA app and saw that the flight had already departed.
Got home and checked app again and noticed that the arrival time had been pushed up by 3 hours.  Basic calculation, but it meant that my kids would CERTAINLY miss their connection to LGA. 
No call, no message from AA.
Called customer service, asked why the plane would be landing so late.  Was advised that the flight departed a full 3 hours 20 minutes after the time posted on the app and the website.  Asked why I wasn't notified (as I had UM minors onboard) and why they were kept on a flight where they would be guaranteed to miss the last connecting flight out of ORD to LGA.
Was greeted with more silence.
Asked what would happen to my kids in ORD and was told that someone from ORD would take my daughters to a hotel and spend the night with them at the hotel before reboarding them to LGA the following morning.  I asked who this person was...more silence.

More calls, 11 hours later, no closer to an answer.  It appears that the current ""plan"" is to try to delay the ORD to LGA flight to allow my daughters to deplane, collect their luggage, go through customs and board the LGA flight.

I bought a $400 basic economy round trip ticket for my brother to visit me.  However, an emergency popped up that made it impossible for him to make the initial outbound flight.

I know that we can't reschedule or make changes to basic economy tickets, so I was ok with buying another ticket.  It only had to be moved by two hours, and since he was already at the airport, I bought it for him.  However, due to being short notice, this one cost $600 for one way.  

Mind you, we were talking with customer service when we bought the one way ticket.

Well today, he tried to return home only to find that since he missed the initial flight out, the rest of the ticket was cancelled.  He couldn't take the return portion of the initial $400 ticket.  The AA customer service told us over the phone that I would need to buy another $500 one way ticket.

Why did the initial AA customer service person sell me on a one way ticket knowing that we could not take the return portion of the initial ticket?

To top it off, they said the rules clearly stated that the tickets had to be used in order.  I should have read the rules and they even emailed me this link.

I read the link.  I pressed CTRL\+F and searched.  The rules very clearly to not contain the phrase 'order' anywhere.  It does not say anything about not being able to take the return flight if you miss the initial flight going out.

Now I'm out $1,500 on a ticket that should have only cost $400 to begin with.

Flight was delayed for 2 hours due to maintenance, and then we boarded. After boarding another American employee walked on to the plane and asked one of the flight attendants ""Who told you to board the plane?"" to which she replied ""The pilot did"" and their conversation ended. Shortly after taking off smoke began to fill the cabin, and you could barely see first class from economy. The flight attendant seemed rattled when speaking to us, however the pilot sounded somewhat confident about turning the plane around with smoke being in the cockpit. Once we landed we sat on the tarmac while the fire department inspected the plane, and then arrived back at the gate. Once we got off the plane we were handed slips to reschedule, without any apology. They told us they were going to do maintenance on the same plane and we were taking off again in 2 hours. Most of the passengers refused to get on the same plane so they cancelled the flight. After speaking with customer relations they did not acknowledge the incident, and simply apologized for the delay and offered some frequent flyer miles. After I responded to the email insisting on speaking with someone I was called by a customer relations representative.

The website presents me several options for switching my flight. One of them looks like it's about the same time as my current flight so I select it. I didn't realize that it's 48 hours later! That means that my 4 day trip to Florida will be a 2 day trip. I'm a computer guy and the website does a terrible job indicating that this is a completely different day!

Last month I purchased a flight back home, and paid for it with AA gift cards given to me by my dad. I applied all 4 gc’s(100 each) and checked out fine and received confirmation. Yesterday I received an online check in email and attempted to do online check in, but some error occurred so I couldn’t. I didn’t think much of it and figured I’d just get my ticket at the terminal.

Fast forward to this morning. I arrive and I can’t retrieve my ticket. I was directed to an AA agent and after she did some work on the computer she notified me that my ticket had been voided. I was surprised because I didn’t receive any notifications of any such thing and I had checked my ticket status multiple times since buying my flight. She attributed this to being a “system error”. I was waiting at the terminal for over a half hour and eventually she was able to retrieve my ticket. The thing was she says that since the flight was leaving soon that I wouldn’t be able to input my gift cards and that I would need to pay cash/credit. I didn’t have much of a choice I either had to pay or miss my flight so I gave her my credit card and I went on my way.

I’m really upset about this experience. I didn’t budget for this trip to account for an extra 400 being spent because I had covered the charges with gift cards( rightfully so in my opinion). The lady helping me patronizingly told me that I’ll at least still have my gift cards to use at a later flight. The thing is I’m running a tight budget, and now I’m being put in a poor financial situation due to an error by the airline and their customer service reps said their hands were tied and couldn’t help me. They directed me to their customer relations department and I sent them an e-mail and am now awaiting response.

A second related question would be, if you do book on Orbitz, is your reservation visible on the AA website when you login ?

Spouse flying with airplane phobia,3,7ylkl5,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/7ylkl5/spouse_flying_with_airplane_phobia/,5,"I am traveling cross-country with my spouse, who has been diagnosed with airplane phobia. The only way he travels is with with me and with the help of some Ativan. Unfortunately, we had to book this flight at the last minute due to a family emergency. This means there are no two seats available side by side - even none we could pay for. My spouse will likely roll into a ball if he has to sit by himself on a 6+ hour flight without me by his side. I could provide an M.D.’s note stating we had to sit together for her mental health given her diagnosis. Would this work? We are willing to take ANY two seats together.

2. Tokyo to Hong Kong
3. Hong Kong to Bali

4. Bali to Dallas
5. Dallas to Orlando

All together, it was maybe $3000. 

Since then my fiance asked that we stay in Japan a couple more days. Sure, I say. I look up flights from Tokyo to Bali and find one on a different airline thats fairly cheap and short, extending our stay in Tokyo to five days. When I call AA to cancel flights 2 and 3, here's what they say:

Option 1: cancel 2&3, pay $250 change fee, and pay reticketing fee for 4 and 5. The tickets for 4 and 5 are now $3000. And thats per person, so like $6500. 

Option 2: don't show up for 2&3, have the rest of the itinerary cancelled.

Option 3: change 2&3 for a different flight, which was $5000 per person reticketing plus the change fees.

Instead of having an AA person waiting at the gate with more forms, our Stewardess asked us to lie when questioned about having filled them out, she said that the airport would probably not realize there were not enough forms compared to the passenger list. 
nobody at the airport questioned me and my wife was pressuring me to be quiet, but that hit me as being completely unethical.

On the way back it was even worse, when booking one of our flights it didn't let us pick our Seats but luckily the check in Lady at SMF was able to get us seats together for the whole way. The flight from SMF(Sacramento) to LAX(Los Angeles) was a decent flight despite getting our drinks and food as we were landing, however from LAX(Los Angeles) to DFW(Dallas/Fort Worth) the staff was horribly rude. My husband asked if they had Cherry Coke and she called him an idiot and then walked away without even giving us our drinks. When we flew from DFW(Dalls/ Fort Worth) to GRK(Killeen) upon boarding my husbands ticket wouldn't scan because once again they had changed his seat without our permission and the attendants at the gate told us to just switch seats with the person they had given his seat to. Well that typically doesn't go well so we talked to the flight attendant was again very rude as if it was my fault they switched his seat without our permission.

We just returned from a trip to Rome over the New Year's break.  The flight their from XXX-PHL-FCO was unremarkable except for a slight delay on the tarmac out of PHL which didn't affect our arrival time.

The return flight, however, was a disaster.  We were originally scheduled to fly FCO-MAD-ORD-XXX departing from FCO was scheduled at 7:45AM and we were to arrive at XXX around 8PM. Upon arrival to FCO at 5 AM we went to check in at Iberia and were told our tickets had been changed.  The agent at the desk stated she could not help us as the flight was booked with American.  She advised use to go to the AA desk for help but unfortunately the AA desk didn't open until 8AM, 15 minutes after our scheduled departure.  

I called AA customer service and after 3 hours on hold we were rerouted FCO-MUC-PHL-XXX departing at 6:50PM and arriving at XXX the following day around 8PM, requiring an overnight stay in MUC.

We were not offered any assistance with meals, communication, lodging or transportation due to the delay.

All flights were booked and paid for as one itinerary via americanairlines.com.  These were not award flights. We received a trip confirmation in September.

I believe that due to EU regulation 261 we are due at least 600 euros per person as well as compensation for expenses incurred due to the delay.  Reviewing US regulations it appears we may be entitled to 400% of the cost of the return trip as well.  I presume it would be an either or and not both.

The flights there were a breeze, nobody travels ON Christmas so the early flights were empty and stress free.

The return flights on New Years Eve were an absolute disaster. My original flight for 5:30AM was delayed twice (beginning at 1AM-which is when my day started), which led to a missed connection, so it was re-booked (with no explanations as to the delays/rebooking). The rebooked flight was delayed twice, and then rebooked to connect to Dallas/Fort Worth. Okay, whatever, as long as I get home at a reasonable time-my original flight had me back in Greensboro, NC at 11:00AM. 

Once I get to Dallas/Fort Worth, everything turns to shit. I had 15 minutes between my flight in to DFW and the flight leaving. Once I board at 10:40AM, the plane sits on a tarmac of 15 planes, and more behind us, waiting to be de-iced for 2 hours. Once our plane is de-iced, we are required to return to the terminal because the stewardess is sick and requires medical attention-and she walks off of the plane by herself. We are then required to disembark, because we are told we are not allowed on the plane without two stewards/stewardesses and one is not immediately available. 

This is now 1:50pm. We are waiting, getting various updates, until eventually we are allowed to re-board the plane at 3:45PM. We then sit on the plane, informed that since it has been such a long time since we de-iced we will have to go through that process again and the line is quite long. But the ""terminal bridge has frozen"" and the plane cannot leave. We were told mechanics were working on it, however no movement was observed in the terminal bridge or outside of the plane.  So we disembark again this time at 5:15PM, told that our flight has been cancelled. As we leave, attendants are rebooking the flights for people. Some are receiving flights that day, and others in the morning-arguments break out over who should receive a flight that night. 

One couple I saw was given a flight to Philadelphia which connected to Greensboro-by the short time that they were given to get to the gate, attendants had shut the door and the plane had begun to depart. The attendant who rebooked my flight put me on a late flight with the same route the next morning, and after calling customer service I determined that this was not the earliest available flight-I was able to find a direct flight to Greensboro by speaking with the attendant's supervisor. What really frustrated me was her lack of compassion and the superiority in her tone as she talked down to me. The supervisor was quite possibly the only redeeming factor-thank you, Michelle.

After all of this, and having this flight delayed-we were supposed to arrive in Greensboro at 11:40PM, didn't touch down until 12:15AM, everyone on this new flight who had been rebooked from the old flight at 10:40AM had their baggage left in Dallas/Fort Worth after several passengers (including myself) had asked the flight crew if our baggage was aboard the plane due to the cancelled flight, and American's baggage locator app said that our baggage was still on the old plane. We were assured that the baggage was aboard-this was not the case.

On top of all of this, the people who had to stay in Dallas/Fort Worth overnight were not given any kind of compensation-no hotel room, no meal allowance, no partial refunds-nothing. Because the incident was coded as ""weather related"", despite the fact that the whole reason the original plane returned to the terminal in the first place was because of a sick steward.

This whole experience has been absolutely disgusting, and I will not be flying American Airlines ever again. I will be posting my story everywhere I can, as this level of care was completely unacceptable and the lack of accountability on behalf of American Airlines is unacceptable.",1514864733.0

After upgrading the ticket the agent tells me I won't get my miles back unless I pay a 150 dollar refund fee. Anything I can do about this?

American Airlines fail,0,7l6x0e,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/7l6x0e/american_airlines_fail/,3,"After weeks of checking fares, I finally purchased a ticket for my mom to come from Brazil at a very good price.  After clicking Purchase, I was so happy that I was going to see my mom soon and that I had scored a great fare!  If I only knew what laid ahead.

I used my American Airlines credit card (not a Visa or MC) to pay for the flight and the following month, I went online to make a payment.  To my dismay, I had not been charged for the ticket I purchased.  
Obviously, I was very confused and didn't understand what had happened.  I immediately called AA only to be told that my payment had been declined.  I was even more confused at this point because I had a zero balance on that card... there was no way to could've been declined and I was never notified that the payment didn't go through.  When I asked why it had been declined, they couldn't tell me and said I had to call the issuing bank.  AA also wouldn't honor the fare that I originally purchased because more than 7 days had passed.  :/  No apologies were made and I basically told that I was SOL.  Being super upset that I lost this great fare and now I had to repurchase at the current fare, I had to know why my card was declined.  

So, I call the issuing bank to find out what was going on. I was told that my payment had been declined because my address had not been updated!!  All of this because of my address!  I couldn't believe it.  I had not even been notified that a charge was declined or even that a purchase was trying to be made.  Of course, I updated my address, but now I have to repurchase the ticket at a way higher price and I honestly think that AA should honor my original fare.  I should've been called about the declined purchase and potential fraud (it could've been someone else trying to use my card). 

Has anyone else experienced something similar with such little regard for the customer?  AA took zero responsibility for not notifying me and did nothing to rectify the situation.  They obviously do not care about their customers and only want to make more money on what is an already expensive industry.  Greedy!

(USVI) St. Thomas Honeymoon Trip,1,71qj0n,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/71qj0n/usvi_st_thomas_honeymoon_trip/,1,"Hello everyone,


 First off, I want to preface this by letting everyone know that my Fiance and I rarely fly so we are very inexperienced as how to handle this situation. Earlier in the year we booked an all-inclusive trip to St. Thomas, with a flight booked through American Airlines.


 With Hurricane Irma and Maria devastating the area, the hotel was heavily damaged and has basically cancelled our reservation for us, for which we received a refund. Unfortunately, American Airlines is only offering us a flight change to be used within a year, without the fee normally change to change flights. I have attempted to explain that we will be cancelling rather than re-booking, as the whole hurricane damage it may be months before the damage is repaired and we do not want to put our honeymoon on hold.


 Due to our lack of experience with flying (and her fear of flying in general) we are changing our honeymoon destination entirely as we cannot change our vacation time easily through work, nor do we want to. We will be driving to this destination, and have no use for a re-booking and I doubt we will fly within a year, if ever again. I have also asked if the tickets/credits could be transferred so we may make our money back by selling to a friend, they denied that as well.


 Long story short, would I have any recourse with a chargeback, or possibly by demanding a refund, or are we just out of luck? It's worth nothing, I bought insurance through the hotel that covers up to $2500 per person for ""travel"", but I have been unable to reach the insurance group as they are based ON St. Thomas, which is having major communication issues currently.


 TL;DR Hurricanes ruined honeymoon, we just want to cancel and never fly again, AA won't issue refund, offer non-refundable credits. Can we chargeback and have any chance of winning case? Chase credit card. ",1506110570.0

I was supposed to be on an international flight to Japan today from LAX. I get to the airport about and hour and a half before my flight, and proceed to the automatic check-in kiosks. I scan my passport, and the screen throws me up a message asking for more info. I type in my confirmation number, and it gives me a message telling me to go to the counter for assistance. So I head over to the counter, and there's obviously a line there, but not too bad. Probably about 10 people in line. I show the line attendant the error message I got, and she opens the rope for me to go in. There are only 2 clerks working the computer for some reason, and they are slow as fuck. Minutes start to go by, and the line is barely moving. I call out to the line attendant again, letting her know that my flight is coming up soon, but she sasses me and says I need to wait like everyone else (fucking useful). 

I have no choice but to wait. Now, like 20 mins go by, and it's time for my plane to start boarding. I'm tell the line attendant again that my plane is boarding now, she tells me to wait. The guys in front of me take compassion and let me cut to the front. The clerk finally calls me up to the podium, and I explain everything, and he tells me, ""Sorry, there's nothing I can do, the flight is already boarding. You're late."" I'm like, ""I'm late because I was waiting in your line."" He just repeats, ""There's nothing I can do. I can't even print your ticket since you aren't checked-in yet."" Yeah, idiot! I was in the line to check-in because the stupid kiosks didn't work! So I ask for a refund, and he says they don't give refunds.

tl;dr I was on-time for my flight, but was forced to wait in a line which caused me to miss my flight. I ask for a refund, but AA refused to give me a refund even though it was their fault that I missed my flight to begin with. Essentially, AA stole my money, and refused to provide service to me due to circumstances that were caused by them in the first place.

Anyway, I bought tickets for my in-laws to get out of Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma.  I bought the tickets on Wednesday the 6th to leave Saturday the 9th.  A few hours after purchasing the tickets, AA notified us the flight was cancelled.  Okay, fine, got them another flight on another airline to another destination.

Just checked my credit card statement, and saw that the charges for their tickets had posted (i.e. not pending)!  I called AA customer service, and the rep told me that the passengers were no-shows. I said no, the flight was cancelled, they didn't just not show up.  She said, well according to what I'm looking at, that flight was not cancelled, and the passengers did not show, so there's nothing she can do.

How the heck can this be?  I checked flightstats.com and flightaware.com, and they both show their flight on the 9th to be cancelled.  Any advice on what to do?  Call customer service again and tell them to check flightaware to see that the flight was indeed cancelled?  File a credit card chargeback?  How does it even happen that AA's records show a cancelled flight as not-cancelled?

Follow-up edit, for anyone else who may find it useful: I requested a refund online here: https://prefunds.aa.com/refunds/ . You have to do it separately for every item purchased (including separately for premium seat choices). I included a short explanation of what happened on each refund request, they limit you to 200 characters on the form. Later that day, they were marked as refunded!

Voucher issue -- please help,1,6qu721,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/6qu721/voucher_issue_please_help/,4,"Hello, all!

I'll try to keep my story brief, but want to explain a bit.  I'd really appreciate some help getting to someone at AA who can get me the money I'm owed...

Back in Spring of 2016 was basically the height of Zika spreading like wildfire through the Virgin Islands.  I was supposed to go to a wedding there, but was pregnant (second trimester) so was advised to not go by my doctor.  AA was helpful at this point, and was willing to work with me to schedule a weekend elsewhere.  They said I needed to submit a doctor's note to get the remaining balance from the cancelled, more expensive, trip back.  I submitted the note and received a travel voucher. So far, so good.

Fast forward to this Spring, and my sister and I were going in together on some flights for family members.  I was told I had to call in order to redeem vouchers, so we got a guy on the phone at AA who said it'd be no problem, but what I had to do was just go ahead and purchase the tickets, and then mail in the voucher (he gave very specific instructions on what to include, which I followed to the LETTER).

About 5 months later (a few weeks ago), I realize I never heard from them after sending in what they asked for.  I called, and they sent me to Customer Relations -- who you can only email via the website, not call.  I told Customer Relations I was checking on the refund I'm due and, long story short, they ultimately said: ""...while I am sorry for the misinformation you received, I must respectfully decline your request for a refund of your expired voucher.""

After this, I got only what were basically canned answers brushing me off.  I asked to speak to a manager; I asked for reference to someone else, and got just canned replies.

I find this unacceptable.  They need to follow through with what their employee told me.  I did exactly as I was told every step of the way, and I want my money back.

Apparently purchasing your own seat does not automatically permit you to use all seat functions: such as using the overhead light during a night flight. I was harassed for using mine- repeatedly. Occupier of middle seat questioned why I had it on so long, when I would be finished, and glared at me to the point of serious uncomfortableness. It escalated to the point of the woman calling the flight attendant twice and asking if she could change seats- she was tired and needed sleep in a dark place, and secondly to have an eye mask. I mean seriously? I paid $596 for this seat and because you were ill prepared for this flight- I am supposed to conform to your demands and not complete my work, use my light, or electronic device? Incredibly selfish, rude, and a feeling of entitlement. Not to mention the huffing and puffing over anyone who was using their overhead light or electronic device, people snoring, a baby crying.. and then throwing oneself all over their seat to make a passive aggressive point, repeated overlap into my seat, the removal of your shoes producing a foul odor for all other passengers, barefeet placement on the tray table, climbing over me without even uttering the word excuse me, or signaling you want out or in, and pushing my seat back as if it were your own as you stand up repeatedly. 

She then notified me at baggage claim my left leg was swollen and I most likely had a blood clot and should seek immediate medical attention.

She thought that NC was in CDT and not EDT. Instead of an hour, I had 10 minutes to run across the airport and hope to make my flight. Of course, I missed it. When I got to the gate I was told there was nothing they could do and to add insult to injury the reservation agent hung up on me. I called American back and was told there were no more flights and the best they could do was get me on a flight tomorrow afternoon. I would still be responsible for my hotel tonight, however. I asked if I could still just go to Chicago and I was told no because that seat was already sold to someone else. I was, for lack of a better word, stranded at the airport.

In the end I called my company's travel agency and they booked me first class on Delta in the morning and put me up in a nice hotel. A good ending to an otherwise bad experience.",1497517105.0

AAdvantage miles questions,3,6ef3b1,americanairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/6ef3b1/aadvantage_miles_questions/,6,"I am trying to plan a trip in September of 2018. I am trying to minimize the cost of air travel as much as possible. I already got the CC and got the 40k miles bonus so I have a balance of 45k miles right now. It's looking like for my wife and I to travel together to the Caribbean we could need as much as 110,000 miles. This is not my main CC so I don't get a lot of miles on it but I might have to start using it more. 

Questions:

* Does AA allow you to do partial orders, meaning I pay for one ticket in miles and pay for the other in cash or will I be forced to purchase enough miles to pay for both? In my example it would cost almost as much to purchase 65k miles as it would be to just purchase the flights outright. 

* If my wife also signed up for a card and got a 40-50k bonus could she then gift those to me? Otherwise it would probably be difficult for both of us to book at the same time and get seats by each other. 

* what other suggestions for trying to travel via AA miles do you have?

When I used Delta miles I was able to knock down the price of the tickets by using miles, I didn't necessarily need to purchase more miles to cover the cost, does that make sense?",1496267653.0

My 11:00am flight was delayed to 11:30am. No reason, no big deal. Everyone boards. Then we are told that there is a ""missing part in the cockpit"" that must be located and replaced. The pilot says once the piece is found, it won't take long--no worries. An hour goes by, nothing. Half an hour more and we are told to deplane because the part cannot be located. Those of us without checked bagged (thanks /r/onebag) are told to go to a different gate where a 2:00pm flight is boarding! Nice! I'll still make my connection. Once there and after waiting in line for another 30 minutes or so, we are told there are not enough seats and to go to a different gate. Several of us arrive there, to a closed gate. At this point, this rag-tag team of once strangers is armed with pitch forks and headed to the AA service desk...to be greeted by a massive 300 person line of all the original passengers (the ones who had checked baggage and thus were not distracted by the promise of a 2:00pm flight). After waiting for another hour and a half, we are told to go to our original gate number: our original flight is boarding and we are going to leave! I'll miss my connection, but that's ok it's still progress. We are told to line up so they may reprint our boarding passes, sit down, and then re-board based on our original boarding passes. Another hour or so line. After waiting for another 30 minutes to board, the AA staff member comes on the PA and says the fight is actually cancelled and they will be handing out hotel vouchers. This is where everything goes to complete shit and I'm sure no one is reading this by now. The woman on the PA asks that we all remain seated and they will call us up. Ok, fine. After waiting for another hour, I realize they aren't calling anyone up...they're just taking whoever comes next. I call AA services from my seat and get rebooked for the soonest flight: a 9:00am that's been delayed until 10:00am the following morning. Seems strange to delay a flight more than 12 hours ahead, I think, but we'll see when I get to the top of the line. Another hour. Finally receive a voucher for a hotel stay at a pre-selected hotel, a voucher for the bus to the hotel, and vouchers for dinner/breakfast. The kind AA rep tells me my flight is at 9:00am, to which I point out that it's been delayed until 10:00am according to the app. Surprised, she says ""Oh...you're right...I've been telling everyone 9am!"" ...nice. Then a gentleman walks up and says ""Yeah, that's the same plane...it's already delayed because it's still undergoing maintenance"". WHAT?? You just rebooked 300 people for the same flight and the plane isn't even functional? And told them all the wrong time anyway? Whatever, I just need to get to a hotel at this point. After 2 hours in passport control, I'm finally free of the airport! Only to be told that the bus that we have a voucher for to get to the hotel...yeah, it doesn't go to that hotel. SOL, either pay for a taxi or walk. I hoof it the measly half-mile, only to be met by most of my other fallen comrades, dazed and confused at hotel reception: ""AA only reserved 50 rooms for all 300 of us"". You've got to be joking.

I didn't purchase the flight and put it on reserve. The part i'm confuse about is it shows my flight is it shows my total is 50,000mi and 86$. I need 50,000 to book the flight

Is it because I used the rewards to buy the flight? if I book the flights using google by searching my direction, it takes me to the site and lists the price as is which is 196$ and I'm planning to leave from the 18th-21st of the month

If you work for United whether it's at the gate, at check in, customer service, phone lines, or outside on the ground servicing the planes and whatnot, or if you're a baggage handler, you can send me a message with some proof (if you have any) and I'll give you a nice official flair so that people will know who to look for for additional insight to their questions. We've already have a few people who are currently flaired up as representatives and airport personnel, who are more than happy to help you out.

Welcome to the /r/unitedairlines subreddit.

If you came here with a big ass story about how United kicked you off the plane, burned your luggage, and left you to die, please be detailed so that we can try to explain to you what happened and why it did.

If you didn't understand that, what I mean is PLEASE elaborate on your situation and what exactly happened. There are plenty of people who know United and have flown them a good amount of times and know what to expect, and there are also a good amount of employees who look at the subreddit from time to time.

Don't just come in here and be like ""United delayed my flight for 3 days straight and now I'm stuck at a hotel/sleeping at an airport/dying. Fuck united i'm done"". These useless rants add nothing to the subreddit since we don't even know what the entire situation was.

Add some information about your entire journey and what factors the United crew told you or maybe explain your situation further so that commenters can see all this information and tell you ""Ah, I see. This happened because of United's XYZ policy which means that you can't XYZ even if XYZ"". or something like that, so that you get some closure as to why you were stranded for 4 decades at Newark.

And flair your post as story or question if you can.

TLDR when you have an issue with united and you'd like to ask us for help or more info about your issue/your travel problems, be DETAILED and SPECIFIC and state the who what when where why so that we can help you and explain what happened.

Thanks.

1. What's the likelihood that we'll be able to keep our status if we keep our plan of 3 trips to IAD each year (if we don't fly direct that'll get us to the 12 minimum segments)

This Thu/Frid, again over $4k, then Sunday/Monday it was at over $7k per person.. I just looked at it again and now (today, Tuesday) it is at $2k.  Can anyone explain these price pattern fluctuations?  I am now wondering if the price would go down even further as the departure date nears.  I am tempted to purchase at least one of the seats for the wife if price goes down.  (she has never flown int'l and a first/business class polaris would be a nice surprise for her, but the price is keeping me at bay). 

I am only a United Mileage Plus member, no elite status.   Can anyone explain or provide further insight into these fluctuations and any possibility that it may go further down.  any recommendations to try to catch it at a lower price.  the flight (UA48) departure is on 11/06/19  and i see quite a few Polaris seats that are still available.   thanks.",1570006120.0

(I have booked basic economy tickets before and normally they warn you all over that you’re buying a basic economy ticket.)

Then when I received the actual confirmation email, it said the first baggage was $60, which was not the case when I booked the ticket.

Fare classes: K and T (I thought N was basic economy?)

My question is what I can do in this situation. Customer service said they can’t change the reservation. I’m wondering if I can go to the airport and talk to the agent directly about this situation to see if they can waive the fee? Can I just print out the initial email and show them that it says the first bag is free and also that I was able to choose a seat without any fees (meaning it wasn’t actually basic economy)?

This is largely a ski trip so I will have checked bags and want to confirm that I am understanding the allowances correctly.  I think it is giving me incorrect baggage allowances on the webiste due to the complexity of the itinerary.  Here is my itinerary and what I think the bag allowance will be:

&#x200B;

First travel day:

&#x200B;

BZN>NRT on United metal

NRT>CTS on ANA metal

Website says first bag free, second $100.

I think this should use United's allowance of 2 free bags for USA>Asia travel

&#x200B;

Second travel day:

&#x200B;

GVA>IST on TK metal

Website says 2 free bags.

I think this should use Turkish weight-based allowance of 20kg, plus their website says they will transport one set of ski equipment in addition to your allowance for free.

&#x200B;

Third travel day:

&#x200B;

IST>ORD on TK metal

ORD>BZN on United metal

Website says first bag free, second $100.

I think this uses the Turkish bag allowance of two 23kg bags free when flying to the US.

The False Premise of Full Overhead Bins in Order to Force-Check Passenger Carry-On Roller Bags,3,d1hfoo,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/d1hfoo/the_false_premise_of_full_overhead_bins_in_order/,12,"So I'm taking a flight from Washington Dulles to Seattle and they forced me and about 25 passengers behind me to check our regulation size roller bag carry ons on the basis that the overhead bins were full. I've seen this happen before and then get on the flight to find that there was quite a bit of room left that could have accommodated my bag and several other bags, but in those cases it was at least close to full so I found the efforts reasonable. 

But today, I specifically asked the gate agents when they were forcibly checking in my carry on bag... Are the bins currently full or nearly full? Or are you simply anticipating them to fill? They said ""Oh no no no, they're full. Here we need to check your bag."" Ok, fine, I said.  

So I get on the flight. I kid you not there is room for 25+ additional bags in the overhead bins. Like, a TON of room all over the plane, including directly over my seat all the way back in row 30. 

I ask the flight attendant about this and if she can help. She tells me no, that decision is entirely on the gate agent, and that this sort of thing depends on my ticket type...? I didn't get her to elaborate much but she sort of suggested that  the standard practice is to check all bags with zone 4 or late boarding or something? Doesn't make sense as the ticket I booked allows a carry on bag and a personal item to travel with me. 

I understand the need to check the bags if the cabin storage is full. I understand the desire to preempt such a need as well. But is there not a better way that could be developed to avoid these types of situations that I am in now? As opposed to a rough guestimate based on the number of passengers on the flight and how late into the boarding process one is boarding? I have important items in that carry on and now I have to wait at luggage claim when I otherwise wouldn't have had to. I made pick up arrangements anticipating not having to go to luggage claim. Not to mention there is now a risk of that luggage getting lost that did not need to be taken.

Another gentlemen in front of me brought his carry on into the cabin and placed it comfortably in an overhead bin, despite it being tagged. A flight attendant later came by and removed his bag, saying it has been tagged and therefore must go under the plane. Needless to say, he was not happy. I wasn't happy either. 

Can anyone help me understand this? Is there any recourse in these situations in the future? Does anyone with inroads into the United Airlines leadership understand the underpinnings of this practice, and can perhaps suggest an improvement? Can't the on board staff walkie talkie with the gate agent to indicate how many bags they can accommodate overhead throughout the boarding process, perhaps at each zone boarding interval?

This was an incredibly frustrating experience. I am not a happy customer. The flight attendants addressed me as if I had done something wrong by questioning this practice, and by wanting my bag to stay with me if possible, which it clearly was. They would not entertain retrieving my bag at all (which at that point in the process, I understand, as it is already under the plane probably). But it doesn't make the rest of the situation OK and it doesn't make these complaints invalid.  I imagine I'm not the first nor last to experience this. Would United not be interested in improving this process?

It has a yearly fee ($95), but United consistently had the best prices, though the leg room and other benefits were worse. As time has gone on, though, the situation has gotten worse and worse. The prices are now higher than Delta, Hawaiian, Alaskan, etc. and the benefits for accruing miles [keep being tweaked](https://liveandletsfly.boardingarea.com/2019/04/05/united-mileageplus-2019-changes/) to be more restrictive, and United has spearheaded the 'basic economy' movement and its competitive prices often forbid a even single carryon bag (which is ridiculous, imho, and leads to misleading price comparisons on booking sights. 

I've also found that delays and other issues no longer seem to merit even a ""We're sorry about that"" from customer care. This isn't entirely United's fault, but I had a flight a few months ago with an extremely obese couple in the two seats next to me. With the seats already as tiny as possible, I couldn't use my armrests and lowering my tray table to use my laptop was practically impossible for the whole flight. My email to United about it didn't even get a response. This isn't even what I'm writing about, though. 

Checking flight prices today for a business flight next week, they're not even close to competitive with the other airlines, regardless of which airport I fly into. 3/4 of my most recent flights, I used other airlines, and the only time I used United I booked with reward miles to begin spending them off.

It seems like they're confident that I (and others) will keep using the MileagePlus card and frequent flier miles out of loyalty, but why?

I remember picking Economy because it would allow me to bring a carry-on but looking for more info has gotten me confused. I guess my questions are:

1. Did United change the name of the class (meaning Basic Economy has been relabeled to Economy thus getting rid of the old Economy class)? Or does the company consider them two different classes?

2. For an Economy ticket will I be allowed one personal and one carry-on? I read that Basic Economy requires you to check your carry-on but for Economy you can bring one carry-on but that information was kind of all over the place.

My email of the flights all say Economy, not Basic Economy (if that helps.) It's my first time flying with United and I guess my main concern is the carry-on thing since I'm unsure if I should be checking them or if I can bring them with me on the flight.

Cancelled Flight / No bags / missing gear for trip,3,cp0110,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/cp0110/cancelled_flight_no_bags_missing_gear_for_trip/,8,"I was on SFO to YWO via Newark last Thursday, flight was cancelled.

I did that but now I’ve been waiting on my bags for four days, with United telling me it will be the next flight every time. The bag has all my gear for the trip, and I’m just racking up expenses waiting in Ottawa. Thinking of just flying home, or spending about 3000 to buy new gear- but that seems insane. What should I do?

Edit: now that this is over, the worst part of this experience was the customer service- I get that flights are sometime cancelled and bags lost but waiting in three hour lines and being out on hold for an hour only to talk to someone in India who can’t help you and says a manager will call who never calls is super frustrating!

I was told by both airlines that my checked bag would be transferred as well. I took the flight, got to Denver, and my bag did not show up. I went to United's desk at the baggage claim, and they made a lost baggage claim for me. Since then, I've been getting texts every 12 hours from United saying that they are still searching for the bag.

From United's website: 

>"" If we're unable to find your bag after three days, we'll pay you $1,500 for the value of the bag and its contents without requiring any documentation. We'll also reimburse you for the amount you paid to check the bag. ""

As of right now, It's been 3 days. Does that mean I'm entitled to $1,500 from United? If so, how do I go about getting that? I called the Baggage Resolution Center at 1-281-3526 and the person was kind of hard to understand, but it seemed like he was telling me to make another claim online.

Missing Bag - Can't Get Resolution,5,ch2z8y,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/ch2z8y/missing_bag_cant_get_resolution/,5,"What are my other options to locate a missing bag besides filling a claim? I've spoken to the United baggage office in Grand Rapids, MI and called customer service. 

On Sunday, July 20th, I was due to fly from Grand Rapids, MI (GRR) to Jacksonville, FL (JAX) with a connection in Dulles, VA (IAD).  We boarded then were notified that there was a ground stop at IAD which caused my GRR flight to be delayed by about 4 hours. We returned to the gate and they deboarded the plane. Once the ground stop was lifted, I learned my connection left and there were no other connections available for the night. When they notified us to board again, they couldn't rebook me on another flight from GRR until the next evening. Instead, I opted to go back home and rebook rather than board and be stuck overnight in IAD.

Since I was traveling for business, my supervisor  told me to just reschedule my trip for a later date altogether. However, my bag still went all the way to JAX. I called the baggage claim customer service line immediately, and they said my bag was going to be held at IAD overnight and was scheduled for a flight to JAX at 8:15am Monday. The representative said he'd message IAD and have them reroute my bag back to GRR. It wasn't, and it went on to JAX.  The baggage tracing showed a message that my bag was being rerouted back to IAD but there's been no other scans. Three additional calls later, customer service says they can't reach the JAX office and the last scan still shows arrival at JAX as of yesterday. 

Another call to customer service, I was told it was scheduled to arrive in GRR this afternoon. I went to GRR but it never arrived. The GRR baggage office said it still showed in JAX and didn't see anything about it being rerouted back to GRR. The bag is still possibly in JAX or maybe at IAD? Bottom line, it's somewhere, but no one can give me any info other than it was last scanned in JAX yesterday morning. 

TL:DR: My bag went to JAX, but I didn't. Customer Service was going to have the bag rerouted back to GRR but JAX hasn't responded. Online showed it was being rerouted to IAD. No one can give me additional info on it's status  or whereabouts, and I can't get resolution.",1563968800.0

Me: I purchased a ticket for my girlfriend and she is flying later tonight. Can we get her on standby for this flight?

Agent: This flight is full so I do not see the point, but she should automatically be on the standby.

Me: That’s ok, crazier things have happened. Can you show me the standby list with her name on it?

Me: I understand the flight is full. Ok here’s the united app. How do I do it?

Agent: What am I looking at?

Second Gate Agent: I don’t know. This flight is overbooked and I have to handle that.

I walked away as they said the flight was full so continuing to push was futile. **Imagine my frustration when** I had 2 empty seats next to me on the flight.

I’ve been at least 1k for 10 years straight.

My wife is 1k due to my million miler status. I passed along my status to her. 
She only flies around 15,000 miles a year on United. 
She spend around $3k a year on United. 

So the majority of time we fly United together, she gets upgraded and I don’t. It’s become an ongoing joke between us. I always buy our tickets, so they’re the exact same fares. 

Today we’re flying on tickets I used my miles to buy for us. Once again she’s being upgraded and I’m not. 

There are four people between us on the upgrade list. 

Four. 

Can anyone explain to me how that’s possible? I booked our tickets using my miles. It seems as though we’d at least be equal on the upgrade list. Right?

I’m happy she always get upgraded. And let’s be honest, if it was the other way around, I’d still insist she takes the upgrade. 

But here’s where I’m annoyed. I can fly any airline, yet I choose to book the majority of my travel through United to keep my status high so I will get more upgrades. It makes me question their upgrade system when someone who spends very little money and travels very little on their airlines is consistently getting upgraded over someone who spends a lot of money, always flies over 100,000 miles a year.

for example, i'm a current medical student trying to fly home in a couple of weeks for a wedding. currently, my clinic director has sent out a schedule requiring me to be in the hospital on fridays which works for me because i'm planning on flying from saturday-monday. this also works well because i can't miss clinic unless i'm like, dying (they're crazy strict on this for some reason).

however, my director has stated that the clinic schedule is subject to change, and he's known for changing things last minute. if he does change the schedule, i'll most likely be switched to having clinic on a monday. i was hoping that if i buy travel insurance and if the bad news comes i could get reimbursed, but i'm not sure how it works in this scenario.

Not really sure if this belongs here but I’m posting it anyways. Today I flew from Chicago to Columbia SC via United. I measured my bag in advance twice to confirm it was carry on sized (tape measure & the bag fitter at the airport). Upon boarding the plane, I was instructed my bag would be put underneath the plane instead of carry-on. I attempted to make a case by informing them that between my laptop and PS4 pro, I wasn’t willing to risk them being damaged in loose overhead so I’d prefer to keep them as carry on baggage in my suitcase. I was promptly shut down, handed a plastic trash bag, and told to put my electronics inside the trash bag or forfeit my flight. Due to having two meetings tomorrow, my hand was forced and I had to use the bag. I can only assume the jostling of the plane damaged my equipment, because my PlayStation is now inoperable despite using it an hour before heading to the airport. I’m posting this here to simply spread awareness around traveling with tech. United informed me they don’t cover electronics despite the fact that they substituted my suitcase for a plastic trash bag. Although the system might not be extremely expensive, the memories lost on it are irreplaceable. I hope none of you have a similar experience.",1562330349.0

I have a question about signing up for a United Explorer Card. I'm a regular United traveler and usually fly them once a week.

I just started with my company about 6 months ago out of college. I've had a credit for about 10 months now, and I got my first card last October. My credit is very good and I stay on top of things very well. 

I've applied for a United card twice now and have been rejected twice based in an insufficient history, according to United/Chase. The last time I applied was April. I'd like to know how I can get a card or how I can talk to someone on the phone about it. I can't get anyone on the phone (can't talk to a human) and I tried going the email and Twitter route and they just gave me useless links to check out. Does anyone know how long I need a credit history to get a card, or at the very least does someone know how I can talk to someone about getting one?

So I booked a flight for my gf for today flying half way across the US. We went to check in yesterday and were met with a screen that said it was looking for volunteers to move to tomorrow + a voucher. So we said ""fine, whatever"" and selected a voucher, but it said she still has to go to the gate today (which the airport is an hour away), why?

I also called United to offer that she gets put on a different flight to a different city that I found on their website (which would actually be closer for me than her current destination city) that's leaving out of the same airport around the same time (T-30) for a similar rate and we'd be happy about that and no one is out money and she doesn't have to go to the airport twice if she gets told she's waiting until tomorrow anyway.

They told me that they couldn't do that via customer service bc of the ticket type/priority and she'd have to go to the airport and ask for that? I asked for a number for someone to call there and they said they couldn't give it to me.

What can I reasonably expect in this situation? Is she just going to have to drive and hour and not know if she's on a flight or not and then have to drive the hour back to get up for an early flight tomorrow to do the same thing? Isn't customer support kinda supposed to be able to move people around and change tickets?

My family previously booked a vacation with my older brother, however due to work, he was not able to come along with us (he works in the entertainment industry so it was no big surprise). So, we contacted United and had the ticket exchanged for its worth in United ""credit"". Pretty much the way it worked is if we were to book a flight to Hawaii that cost $500 we can use this ""credit"" to pay for $400 of that total cost, only under his name. 

However, the reason I am still querying about a refund on top of this one is that my brother has not used the credit, and most likely will not anytime soon, with the expiration of that credit creeping quite close. So here is how my final question goes: Is there any way do refund, redeem, or convert my brother's ""credit"" with United Airlines into cash or anything else at this point?

I had an expensive multi-city itinerary that United cancelled because they suspended the main legs of that flight.

The agent I talked to refused to book me an alternate flight, and offered a refund instead. (There are flights by their alliance partners between those two destinations). I hung up, deciding to try another agent instead later.

Can they get away with cancelling the flight without providing any alternate bookings? Is there any compensation I can expect/demand? Looking for suggestions to negotiate the best possible way out of this. Thanks!

(PS: it was basic economy, and they let me know 45-ish days before)

_**Update**: I called back to try my luck again, and this time got a much more helpful lady, who not only was willing to rebook, but also offered me an explanation of why my itinerary has been cancelled (I knew it but it's a sign of good customer service). I offered to take a short domestic hop off my itinerary to get in her good books, increase the available options, and make the booking process over phone easier, and she rebooked me (on a non-alliance airline at that) for no extra charge. I'll have to hit the road for a 6 hour drive to my final destination - I'll take that. Goes on to show that the classic tip of hanging up and trying another agent works :)._",1561956138.0

Decided to make an account to post here, as soon as I discovered that United had a subreddit. I'm not really one for complaining about things, but I feel like my experience was enough reason to.

&#x200B;

**TL/DR: I had a series of bad experiences on a single round trip, and want to see what can be done in terms of accommodation. I hate complaining, and I'm not an aggressive person, but I'm hurt by this.**

&#x200B;

I'm a 19 year old college student, studying in Utah, quite far away from where the rest of my family is, in South Carolina. Since moving for college in September of 2018, I had never been on an airplane before, and the idea made me nervous, though it would be necessary for me to visit my family during the breaks I'd have in college. Mind you - my college works on a strange, ""accelerated"" schedule, and so I have somewhat frequent breaks of two or so weeks when most colleges don't, trading off summer vacation for one less year of college.

&#x200B;

On my most recent break before my Summer quarter, I purchased a round trip ticket from the SLC airport, to South Carolina. The trip there brought me to GSP on June 8th, and the trip back started at CLT, on June 23rd. Both had connections. 

&#x200B;

So, the first flight: SLC to GSP, connection in ORD. The flight to ORD was fine, and the flight to GSP was set to depart at 6:30pm central. Some time before the flight, the gentleman at the gate announced that they had overbooked the flight, and they were looking for volunteers to change flights. I wasn't able to do this - I had plans for the days up ahead, as I only had two weeks to be at home to see and meet with friends and family, in addition to not driving, and not wanting to ruin any potential plans my mother had.  They had three people come to the counter to change flights, each getting accommodations at a hotel for the night, in addition to, if my memory does not fail me, $750 worth of travel voucher credit, and a fourth individual was needed. The man at the gate was offering more and more money worth of travel voucher credit, finally getting a fourth individual at $1000 worth of credit, in addition to accommodations for the night.  


Everyone boarded the flight on time, and soon, 6:30pm came around... and we were still on the ground. 7:00pm comes along, and the pilot informs us that there was an issue with their communication system. We sat on the ground until 8:30pm, a full two hours of sitting on the plane, before we were directed to a new gate, and we all got off of the aircraft, to wait at the gate until further information was given. The flight was incrementally delayed further and further with no word of when the flight would take off, until the remaining passengers boarded, and took off at 11:30pm central. We arrived at GSP at 3:00am eastern, originally supposed to land at 9:30pm eastern. I was exhausted and very upset, especially considering the passengers on that flight were given zero compensation, apart from some small snacks at the gate we were waiting at, after seeing four people avoid that madness, each with nearly one grand each, one with one grand of travel credit. I'm not much of a complainer, and I let it go, mostly due to being tired and just wanting to go home.

&#x200B;

But then my flight back to SLC, two weeks later, came along. On the 22nd of June, I had a connection at IAH, that had been delayed before I got there, originally supposed to depart at 9:35pm, but delayed to 11:35pm, after a series of sporadic changes.

&#x200B;

11:30 rolled around, and, we all at the gate, were told that our flight was being delayed once more, until 5:45am the following morning. We were all told to go to a customer service center, which was closed and had nobody there for a while, and we all, one by one, were given meal vouchers of $20 value. Everything was closed, however, and they were useless. Some of us were given hotel accommodation, but most, including myself, stayed at the airport, such a small amount of time not really being enough to properly rest, travel times between the airport and the hotel taken into account, as it was 12:30am when most of us had been seen by customer service. Upon speaking to the individual I did at the desk, I was told to submit a complaint to United's Feedback page on their website. So, I did. And the complaint didn't submit - it claimed to have a communication error of some sort, each time I tried.

&#x200B;

We all waited for 5:45am to come around, and once it finally did, we finally flew to SLC, and arrived at \~8:00am mountain time. The only accommodation we were given for that night was an email to give us a seventy-five dollar ($75) travel voucher. Because of that experience, I arrived at my apartment at 9:00am, and slept during the day, ruining my sleep schedule for my college classes, which started on the day after, that Monday.

&#x200B;

The reason I'm posting here is because of the mistreatment I and the others on the flights I was on dealt with, and the seeming lack of care had about the situations. I'm a college student, and I can barely afford flying at all, so I'd be more than happy to settle with accommodation of some sort, but $75 worth of travel credit feels like a slap to the face. I've only flown a few times, and this definitely was not a good first impression from United. I just want to see if there's something that can be done, or anyone I can talk to about this. I hate complaining, and I'm not angry.

&#x200B;

Our original flight was three days ago. It was delayed because of problems with the inbound flight (actual cause not given, which makes me suspect a mechanical problem) and the delay was so long we were going to miss our connection. Our only option was to rebook for the same time the next day and hope for the best. That flight was cancelled because of weather in Denver.

 Today, Sunday, we're sitting in another airport in another city 100 miles away from home, and the first leg of our flight is already delayed enough to put our connection at risk. I was told by the gate agent that ""estimated wheels up time"" is an hour *later* than the departure time on United's app and on FlightAware. Our connecting flight is one of the last of the day, so if we miss it we'll have to spend the night in Chicago.

 We've already lost three days of our vacation. United is offering us nothing except maybe a refund of the miles we used to book this trip. They haven't let us rebook with another airline, even though they've done so with other passengers in the past. When we try to escalate our complaint to a supervisor, they put us on hold and then hang up the call. Asking for assistance on Twitter gets us nothing but radio silence. 

I know the weather in Chicago is bad today, so I know there's no recourse there. But this WHOLE problem could have been avoided had United been at all competent in handing the original delay. And yet United is giving us nothing besides ""Lol idk, sucks to be you *shrug emoji* and we're just stuck in airport purgatory; we missed a wedding, we're missing our vacation, missing the only chance to see family this year, and we've spent money on gas and expensive long-term parking that shouldn't have been necessary in the first place.

Anyone have this happen before or can you explain it better than  the supervisor did?

A.  Why would seats become “blocked”?
B.  Is what he said true, that we are just overreacting and should wait till we get to the airport?

Girlfriend stuck in Columbia,0,c39rh0,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/c39rh0/girlfriend_stuck_in_columbia/,2,"My girlfriend and two of her sisters who live in various parts of the US, were planning to meet-up and do a group camping/hike up Machu Piccu in Cusco Peru.

She was flying United from Minneapolis-Saint Paul (MSP) and meeting a sister in Newark (EWR), before heading to Cusco via Bogota Columbia.

I dropped her off at June 19th at 12:30 PM for a 3:20PM flight (MSP->EWR).  It was delayed by several hours, but oh well.  She eventually made it to Newark (EWR).  She met up with her sister, and they remained at the Newark Airport until June 20st 9PM or so (27 or so hours).  At that time, they were already going to miss their planned excursion in Peru and are exhausted from sleeping in the airport, constant flight delays, boarding, getting on tarmac, waiting 2.5hrs, back to gate.  United then cancelled flight 886 and she told me that she is going to try and come home.

Early this AM just after midnight on July 21st, I received a text that they were going to give it one last shot.  She is now saying that they are going to be stuck in Columbia, not able to get to Peru.

My girlfriend is the nicest person I know—one of those people with a huge heart.  The texts I’m getting from her are making me really sad.

So she is apparently in Columbia now, with no way to her destination.  I don’t know what kind of cell service/wifi they have there, so no idea what is going on.  United 1.800 number “larger than normal call volume.”

Wondering if anyone has any advice here.  Someone on the United Facebook page mentioned filing a formal complaint with the US Department of Transportation, but not sure that will help the current situation.",1561147660.0

Supposed to leave on a red eye tonight to make it to a friend’s wedding tomorrow, but my wife suffered pretty bad injuries after falling down a flight of stairs at work and she definitely shouldn’t be traveling while she recovers.

I booked my flight through Chase Sapphire rewards and didn’t realize I was booking Basic Economy, which has a bunch of restrictions, including no changes or cancellations.

I called United and they told me to call Chase because Chase Rewards acted as the travel agency. Called Chase Rewards and they basically called United while on the phone with me and were told that if I can submit the documentation on the United website, they might be able to do something for me. 

I submitted a request through the refund request form as I couldn’t find any other more relevant form. I don’t even necessarily want a refund - it would be preferable if we could get a flight at a later date after my wife recovers so we can at least see our friends and offer our congratulations.

Rainy day of that led to a 4 hour delay of our flight. Finally at 11:30PM the inbound flight which was to be our plane landed and we were supposed to depart at 11:50pm.

A few mins later they told us our flight was cancelled due to crew unavailability. We made our way to customer service to rebook and request a hotel room for the evening. 

It was a long line and after finally reaching the front we were told that the reason for the cancellation was “FAA FLOW CONTROL” and therefore we do not get a room.

This was a lie. A misclassification of the cancellation to avoid taking care of passengers. Flow control at 11:50pm? When there were barely any flights out of EWR and the rain had stopped? We had already been told the true reason for the cancellation.

I already was pissed off with you from the last time I rode with you (thankfully multiple years ago now) when your reprobate gate agent told me that my tickets were so cheap they weren't anything. You don't think your customers were good enough for you?

&#x200B;

This morning I woke up in Des Moines, IA looking to get on UA372 over to Chicago. Obviously there was a lot of rain this morning, but your reprobate pilot took this to use at his advantage to FREAK OUT at the gate agent about ""we need to make sure our wheels up is right on par"". What you didn't contemplate however is the information getting out that this conversation took place 1 WHOLE HOUR BEFORE THE PLANE WAS EVEN SCHEDULED TO DEPART! How can you tell someone that you weren't going to make wheels up when the plane was all ready to go half an hour before take off? You freaked out at the gate agent for no reason when in all reality it was your fault. You had an alternative agenda to make sure the plane didn't go, then you gave a sissy excuse that you ""care about everyone's safety in bad whether"" even though multiple planes were going out after you told us all to get off the plane! Now I know your reputation is probably preparing you to come at me with statements like ""How do you know all of this happened?"" Well I will have you know that  I'm with the manager that was working that gate agent at the time! Since I'm about to retire I'm finally whistleblowing all the crap that this airline has pulled on people for such a long time! 

&#x200B;

When I finally got to Chicago I was getting excited about making my connection even though I was going to be 90 minutes late to Chicago to begin with, and I was ready to marathon it to my next flight. But NO. You decided to put TWO GATES WITH COMMON CONNECTIONS WITH ONLY A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO WALK BETWEEN FLIGHT TIMES OVER A MILE APART FROM EACH OTHER! Why the HELL did I have to walk from C terminal at O'Hare, go in the underground dungeon, and then run ALL THE WAY OVER TO Terminal F to get to the deep end of that terminal to get on a plane that departs only minutes after landing? That run is literally over a mile! I did not stand a SINGLE CHANCE of making it! You didn't even try to make this work, and you only care about your agenda!

&#x200B;

Now I hear that my connection flight is further delayed! Why can't you just get your act together? I'm sick of the delays, the lies, and the treatment from your staff. Hopefully this post begins a signification of whistleblowing opportunities that people has to expose your corrupt organization!

&#x200B;

And don't even get me started on the 69 year old doctor you tackled because you cared so much about money. Because you don't even care about people, obviously.

Looking for advice on my experience with unauthorized charges and reservations,1,bpuiis,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/bpuiis/looking_for_advice_on_my_experience_with/,1,"On April 16th I tried to book tickets for a flight which created a reservation and paid for the tickets, but something went wrong and I didn't get the tickets. After 2 hours of supervisors trying to straighten it out, they eventually just canceled everything and told me I could call back if I wanted to purchase the tickets. At least they were able to void the charges and I was refunded immediately. I told them I didn't want to buy them that day because they had charged my debit card twice and refunded me a bunch of times and my account was looking very screwed up. Because of this, I ended up booking this flight through another airline. 

&#x200B;

On May 16th, I get a voicemail from United and someone telling me that I need to call and pay for my reservation or it would be canceled. Since I wasn't planning to fly United, I didn't bother calling back after spending hours on the phone with them before. This morning I noticed United has charged me for the tickets anyway and sure enough when I log into my [United.com](https://United.com) I see the fresh reservation confirming they charged me. 

&#x200B;

I immediately call and after being on hold for about 1.5 hours while they call ""support"", I am told that the charges must be from the original agent (which they aren't) and that United isn't responsible for any of it. I ask for the supervisor. I get put on hold for another 30 minutes just to get a supervisor on the phone to which I found out they haven't been briefed and have no idea of my scenario. After 2 minutes of me explaining, they tell me they'll just cancel it. I express my frustration with the entire scenario and tell them that I would like just a partial refund and to actually keep them so I don't have to drive to another city and fly from another airline and avoid all of this inconvenience. To which they reply, sorry, not gonna happen. I tell them to go ahead and proceed canceling whatever unauthorized charges had happened and after another 5-minute hold I'm told to keep my confirmation number from the original reservation, that they canceled it, but that I have no indication other than the itinerary disappearing on their website and that I just had to wait for 7 business days for the money to just show up in my bank account. I ask her supervisor because I want confirmation I'm getting my money back, she declines and tells me to fill out a ""feedback form"" on their website. 

&#x200B;

Now I'm stuck. I see that the website says it was canceled, but I haven't gotten any money back. Last time they refunded me I saw pending refunds in my account the same day, so I'm not sure if I can even trust them with this refund at this point. I'm confused as to why they kept my credit card number without my knowledge and charged me for this reservation I had no idea existed still without my authorization. Should I call my bank and report fraudulent charges on my debit card? Ironically, I have another reservation with United on Jul 5, 2019... I really would have kept the tickets, but no one was willing to even work with me on the cost of the cancellation with the other carrier and  I was laughed at twice when I asked people about it. 

&#x200B;

I've flown United 11-15 times and they have a bunch of convenient routes from the airport that's less than 10 minutes from my house, but now 6 hours into these issues I'm not sure I will ever fly them again.... I guess I'm just looking for feedback on if this is a normal occurrence, advice on how to handle the mystery cancellation that I didn't even get a confirmation of and if anyone has experiences similar and how they might have handled it.

United Premium Plus - one month in review,3,bgj711,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/bgj711/united_premium_plus_one_month_in_review/,6,"Three days ago I posted looking for some reviews on Premium Plus. I was given a helpful one that was a day or two after it went live, so I wasn't sure what to expect. My review here is my experience. It does not include airport concessions or anything not related to Premium Plus.

UA862 HKG-SFO B777-300ER.

Premium Plus gets premier access check in and free checked bags. I already get this, so it wasn't really useful.

By far the most useless benefit is the $42 United Club access.

Premium plus also gets boarding group 1 or 2 (from HKG, we were group 2. On our next two legs, we were group 1). Again, this is something I already have, so it wasn't useful to me.

As we boarded, the experience was largely the same as economy but with dedicated overhead bins in a microcabin behind Polaris Business. No preflight drinks (including water) was served. I asked the flight attendant for water specifically and they brought me some and apologized for being so busy. This may have been a flag for them that something was up and I was grading them, but more on that later.

The amenities were the same as Polaris Business, minus a second pillow and sheet. The amenity kit itself was also the same as Polaris (though this should change eventually).

The screens on the TVs were far larger, with a great picture. Noise reducing headphones, the same as business are also provided.

The seats themselves have decent recline as well as a leg rest and foot rest. The leg rest and foot rest left a bit to be desired in terms of flexibility, but it was workable in specific positions.

Once we took off, a menu was provided. A drink service began with complimentary cocktails, and I opted for a vodka and lime seltzer. They forgot to give us ice, but we forgave them. Then, then dinner came around. I had ordered the chicken; however, they ran out of chicken. This was disappointing, as the Premium Plus cabin had several empty seats. As we boarded, I saw that Premium Plus had filled mostly with non revenue standby passengers, and I asked the flight attendant politely if he was sure I couldn't have chicken. This was likely another cue that I knew what I was doing and was grading them. He said no, my choice was pasta or nothing (the flight attendants should have ensured all revenue passengers got their first choice before offering meals to non revenue passengers). After dinner, the same ice cream economy class got was served. However, our meals came with the same chocolates business class gets as a dessert as well.

The meals in Premium Plus are much heartier and more tasty than in economy. This is a major plus, as the Hong Kong flights are notorious for not feeding you enough in economy.

Mid flight, the same sandwiches economy class gets were offered, with the addition of a basket of assorted snacks. Healthy snack options seemed lacking during this service, and the sandwich was very dry but edible. We did not have a problem with lights being switched on midflight for the snack. Our cabin's lights were in sync with business class.

Prior to landing I was given first choice of meal - the crew likely figured out they were being judged, watched, and graded... especially since they saw me taking photos. The breakfast options, like dinner, were both heartier and tastier.

Pictures of all the food and some other noteworthy stuff here, including both meal options for both meals:
https://imgur.com/a/a3LyLEA

A few small, easy things to improve service: newspapers, a second drink service for alcoholic beverages, waters offered pre departure.

Overall, the experience was largely positive compared to economy (as you'd expect), and worse than business class (as you'd expect). It succeeded in becoming a hybrid class and I'll be taking it again.

AMA about specifics if I can be of assistance.

Horrible service after flight cancellation/24 hour delay,10,bd8b10,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/bd8b10/horrible_service_after_flight_cancellation24_hour/,10,"How much compensation do you all expect for being delayed 24+ hours from your destination by United? I was just delayed 24+ hours into Buenos Aires in March and only received a $150 voucher. This seems like NOTHING to me on a $1000+ flight. A $150 voucher doesn't even cover the upgrade cost to an economy plus aisle seat, which I did not receive on my rebooked flight.

&#x200B;

Here's what went down:  


Starting in January I switched from Delta to flying Star Alliance (I'm in Toronto so direct options on Air Canada and United are generally favorable to connecting in ATL/MSP/DTW for every trip via Delta. I also knew I was doing more international travel this year that was more convenient via Star Alliance). I could have status challenged but I knew I was going to hit Air Canada 35/50k pretty fast (already at 30k miles now) and would be Star Alliance Gold very quickly.

&#x200B;

I was booked on UA4216 from YYZ->EWR Saturday, March 16. I was to continue on from EWR to EZE that night on UA979, where I had an economy plus aisle seat (24K). I paid $200 USD for that seat (one way), on top of a W-class fare. The point of arriving Sunday was to be with a customer Monday morning first thing, and not be jet lagged/direct off a 10 hour flight.

&#x200B;

My flight to UA4216 was cancelled due to crew scheduling issues. I had to hold for over an hour to talk to a United booking agent. She was great, but the earliest flight they could rebook me on was the following evening from YYZ->IAH->EZE, arriving at 10am local time in Buenos Aires. Further, they had no aisle economy plus seats (or any aisle seats period) left, and I was placed in the middle seat of a 777, losing my preferred chosen seat that I had paid for. I was not given or even offered a refund for any portion of my flight, but told to 'open a support case'.

&#x200B;

After being delayed 24 hours due to a United controlled issue(causing me to be a half day late for a customer meeting, and having to attend there direct off a 10 hour flight), moved from a premium economy aisle seat to a middle seat without refund, and having to pay for a night of a hotel room I didn't use, I was offered a $150 travel voucher.

&#x200B;

This seems like the worst airline customer service I've ever had at this point. (I'm on year 4 of flying at least 25k miles)

&#x200B;

For taking volunteers to move their flight to the next day I frequently see Delta, Air Canada, and United offering $800 or more in vouchers. My bare minimum expectations were:

&#x200B;

* At least $800 for a 24 hour delay that was in United's control. Honestly I think it should be more since I did not volunteer.
* A refund of my $200 premium economy seat purchase since I was unable to use it on my rebooked flight, that had to be rebooked due to United's crew scheduling issue.

&#x200B;

Am I being unreasonable? Anyone know how you would challenge customer services decision to give me a $150 voucher?

&#x200B;

Honestly if this is how United does business I won't be flying them again, and certainly will be thinking of switching back to Delta despite connections.",1555308593.0

I was flying Alaskan basic economy, which still guaranteed my carry-on, had better leg room, and saved almost $75 off of United's basic economy price. What gives?

Arriving at the airport we found out our flight was horrendously delayed two hours due to lack of flight crew to ORD.

Which was going to make us miss our flight from Chicago to Japan.

The United Staff at the airport showing no concern or care, they gave us the 1-800 customer service number to call.

After well over 40 minutes on hold, I spoke with someone on the line that showed just as little care.

We were told to fly out to Chicago and hope we make our connection.

We did as we were told, only to watch them close the doors to our flight to Japan as we approached.

Followed by nearly two hours of standing in-line, and begging for help we were finally put on another flight for the next day. (After we had to look up flights ourselves and beg them to put us on it). Making us lose a day in Japan, costing us thousands in hotel fees, and planned tour - setting us back on our planned itinerary. 

We had the pleasure of being scattered throughout the plane, majority of us sitting at the far back most row against the bathroom. With no room to recline, and no possible way of getting any sleep with the constant activity of people going to the bathroom (that we're basically seated against).

We hoped our return flight from Japan to New Jersey to Florida would be better. We were sadly mistaken.

Our flight was once more delayed. We rushed out of the plane, with no chance to pack our duty free sake into the checked in bag as we literally had minutes to catch our connecting flight. Only to have it confiscated by the TSA. (Even though I had no issue bringing the same sake set through less than a year ago). Losing $300 in an instant.

We barely made the flight, only to arrive and find out our luggage never made our flight. The medication I stupidly packed would arrive on a completely different flight.

I've flown with numerous airlines through the years, but this without a doubt had to be one of my worst experiences by far with any airline. The seer lack of care for us missing the flight, and showing little to no desire to help us find another flight to Japan was astonishing.

My girlfriend and I saved up for over a year, sacrificed to get time off work, and bent over backwards to organize our vacation to Mexico. We arrived at the airport at 4:30am the day of our trip to discover our flight had been cancelled. After spending over an hour at the customer help desk, we were told there was nothing they could do, they couldn't possibly get us to our destination within the next four days. We were offered nothing in compensation. NOTHING. Nothing but a half hearted apology from the frazzled woman at the United desk.

So, rather than accept complete defeat, we went to the Delta desk. We spent an additional $2,100 on an entirely new set of tickets for the following morning. Of course, first class was the only option available. Delta was more than accommodating, for the right price. We bit the very expensive bullet and accepted we would lose a day off of our four day trip. Non refundable, of course.

Now, here in beautiful, idyllic Cabo (a day late), I'm stuck in my hotel room, on hold with United's customer ""service"" line because, since we never made our first flight with them, THEY CANCELLED OUR RETURN TRIP. THEY CANCELLED OUR ROUND TRIP TICKETS. With no warning or notice. We only found this out because we drunkenly joked about something awful happening with our return flight and decided to check. Like, surely nothing else could go wrong, right? ..right?!  As of this writing, I genuinely have no idea if we will be back in time for work. Or to pick up our dog. Or at all, at this point.

I see there is a service allowing people to use virtual US cards ([https://www.usunlocked.com/](https://www.usunlocked.com/)) but they don't accept new members at this time.

"For the price of upgrading, Premium Plus is completely worth it. Here is a quick list of pros and cons.",16,awtmah,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/awtmah/for_the_price_of_upgrading_premium_plus_is/,16,"I flew roundtrip from Newark EWR to Tokyo NRT the other week, and decided to upgrade from standard economy to premium plus. Each way, the seat upgrade was $200, so $400 total. 

For a very long flight, such as mine, those $400 are $400 well-spent. This is especially the case if you have a credit card with travel credits. If I were to use some of my credit cards to make the seat upgrade, up to $200-300 of it would have been free. 

Edit: I forgot to add. For my outgoing flight, I had a 7 hour flight delay due to snow. Since we kept trying to deice over and over, those 7 hours were all on the plane. So, in total, I was in my premium plus seat for 21+ hours, and it still wasn't uncomfortable. 

**Pros**:

* The seats are one tiny step below domestic first class. They are not as cushiony, but they are a massive step up from economy and premium economy. I believe they are entirely leather or pleather. 
* The arm rests in between you and your neighbor(s) are about 3-4 as wide as normal ones. There is a little rectangular area for sitting drinks and other items featured. 
* The seats recline back a lot farther than economy or economy plus. It's not an extreme recline, but it is quite comfortable. 
* There are leg rests, and they can be adjusted quite a bit. There is a retractable foot rest, to give your feet a solid platform. 
* The leg room feels great. I could really stretch my legs out whenever I needed. 
* Food seems to come first, and stewardesses seem more prompt. Whenever food arrived, you could see nobody else had any, so that's awesome if you are starving. Whenever I called for the stewardess, she was there pretty quick. 
* The layout of the premium plus mini cabin, on the 777, is 2-3-2, rather than the standard 3-4-3. For me, I sat in the window rows both times. Having a single person next to me was awesome, and the extra space of the arm rests makes it feel like you have some space and privacy. 
* I *think* you board earlier, but am not sure. For both flights, I felt like I was on the plane when it was pretty empty. 
* There are built-in trays for food and drinks that come out of your arm rest. The trays can be adjusted quite a bit, as well.

**Cons**:

* It can sometimes be very tricky to book a premium plus seat. I didn't even know that's what I was booking when I upgraded and chose my seats, because they were labeled ""economy plus."" I was wondering why some ""economy plus"" seat upgrades were $120-150, and others were $200-210. I just thought it would be cool to be in the front of economy plus. Thankfully, I looked into it further and discovered I had booked one of the earlier routes to receive premium plus seating. If you are on one of the routes that has the seating, but it wasn't crystal clear, definitely call the airline to double-check. 
* This is going to sound lame, but I honestly can't think of any others. For the price, and given the length of my flight, I loved the seats. There was no single moment where I found myself thinking, ""Ah, now that's a pity."" Would I upgrade for a shorter flight? Probably not. But the value, $400 for 27 total hours of flying, was incredible. **If** the prices were to change after it is standardized on particular aircrafts, maybe the value just wouldn't be there. However, for right now, especially considering how expensive business and first classes are on international flights, premium plus is a total steal. On my flight, the seating was 1) Economy: $1200, 2) Economy Plus: $1200-1350, 3) Premium Plus: $1400-1550, 4) Business/First Class: $7000. ",1551645338.0

My question: do economy plus tickets have a better chance of getting upgraded to business than basic economy?  Also, will my economy plus upgrade be refunded if the business upgrade goes through?",1550534885.0

Name Change NIGHTMARE,4,apaqka,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/apaqka/name_change_nightmare/,5,"Hi all.

I recently got married.  Apparently, United makes it completely impossible to change your name in their system.  The have rejected ALL of my documentation, so I went ahead and created a new account for a 35K point I would be taking for work.

Now, those points are completely lost, because they refuse to apply to them to the new account, they refuse to change my name on the old account, and I have sent them everything from my TAX RETURN which shows my married name, to social security cards, to ID's, and still refuse to change my name.

I need an escalation path, or something here.  35K is basically status.  I can't believe they are doing this.  :(

***UPDATE:*** 

United has finally contacted me and said that I \*need\* to have a photo ID with my old name.  The problem here is that when I got my new real ID, they took my old ID, and when I got my new passport - they took my old passport, so I literally have no old photo ID with my old name.  I have emailed them asking what I send in for that situation.  Wish me luck.",1549875666.0
Meal selection on International flight and bathroom for Elderly,2,apa2gq,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/apa2gq/meal_selection_on_international_flight_and/,2,"Hey everybody I have a question regarding meal service. May 20th I'm flying my grandma back home to Hong Kong. I booked her a Premium Economy seat. Regarding the meal service she doesn't eat any beef, and generally doesn't like the chicken on flights either. 

I saw that I am able to request special meal such as vegetarian. Is there any way I can request fish for her meal on the flight.

My second question is the Seats for her flight are split almost right in the middle of the bathrooms. In past flights since she is elderly and has some issues walking the flight attendants have allowed her to use the closet bathroom which was in business class. Do you think there will be any issues with the United flight attendants allowing her to use the closer bathrooms if they are in the business class?

Basic Economy Seat Selection Question,1,anvo4h,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/anvo4h/basic_economy_seat_selection_question/,12,"Update: Amazing feedback and context, thank you! Seat has been purchased and I'll update after with how it all worked out :) 

&#x200B;

From your experience, WHEN are the seats assigned for Basic Economy ticket holders? I've searched the web and elsewhere on this sub but somehow haven't figured it out, so I apologize if this is a repeat question. ""Prior to boarding"" could mean many things:

1. At the 24-hour check-in point online
2. When I hand off my luggage to the ticketing agents (checking the bag as a MP-cardholder benefit)
3. At the gate in the few minutes before boarding 

&#x200B;

Follow up question: if I purchase a seat assignment, can I change seats before the flight, and if so, until when?

&#x200B;

My SFO --> EWR redeye is next week. I've been watching the seat map fill up on UA website, starting to get anxious about the imminent fate of certain middle-seatdom, and thinking I should pay the $20 to at least secure one of the last 3 aisle seats. Who would have known so many people would want to fly on Valentines Day?!?

Qualifying this post by saying I of course DID willingly purchase Basic Economy, partly because I am a ""cheap fuck"" (a much-used term on this sub :) ) so I know that I'm paying for the difference in the stress I'm experiencing now :) I'm  curious to see how this will play out... traveled Lufthansa's equivalent Economy Light for SFO --> MUN in November, didn't pay for an assigned seat and ended up having a row to myself for both flights. Possible I used up all of my good travel karma...

(They gave me major attitude about rebooking too, acted like I was inconveniencing them for having a cancelled flight, and apparently tried to upsell one of the other passengers to a higher-class ticket - not for free, they asked her to pay for it - when they rebooked her.)

When they cancelled the flight (second United flight cancelled/delayed this week, both for ""mechanical issues""), a heavily armed security officer with a dog came up and started circling the passengers. Several of us were audibly upset, but we were complaining about United and its policies, and everyone was polite to the airport staff the entire time I was there (staff consisted of one poor guy with a trainee for ALL the United gates, he was running back and forth).

A few minutes later, 2-3 more heavily armed security guards showed up, and moved to create a perimeter around us on all sides. They continued circling while the passengers rebooked their flights with the solitary United rep. I finally left to run to the main United desk past security since the rep had taken literally fifteen minutes rebooking one passenger (and still wasn't done). The armed guards and dog were still circling the other passengers when I left.

Probably my last flight with United!

Edit: Commenter pointed out I'm not including much info, which is legit. I'm trying not to have personally identifying info out there cause I'm a med school applicant and they comb social media for complainers, but I'm probably being a little paranoid, so here's more details:

Flight was UA4117, Milwaukee to Newark Liberty International. Flight was supposed to depart at 5:00pm; maintenance issue came up at around 4:45pm; cancellation, dogs, and security went down at approx. 6:00pm.  


Edit 2: The other flight this week with delay due to ""maintenance issues"" was UA4130, from EWR to MKE, Thursday Jan. 31st, scheduled to depart at 8:37am. That flight had an issue with ""gangway freezing,"" which I wasn't too bothered by because it was the polar vortex. But the maintenance issue for UA4117 was also apparently due to a ""gangway problem"" (which they apparently fixed, but not before the flight crew 'timed out' and left the airport, which was the given reason for the cancellation).   
Could just be bad luck, but two gangway issues affecting two flights in three days makes me a little suspicious. I believe it was the same model of aircraft for both flights, which definitely makes me wonder if there's some sort of manufacturing defect or larger problem.",1549190579.0

The AUS>PMI flight on 09/20/2019 is operated by Lufthansa from AUS>FRA. I see a W class flight for $1293  (the lowest I can get) RT on United, and a Q class flight for $1533. 

1. Are GS members restricted to the same fare class terms on Lufthansa or would my friend be able to upgrade us on W class? I know, for example, that GS can upgrade even an XN award fare on United, even though others normally can't, so not sure if GS might have extra perks in this regard as well, or if everyone is bound by Lufthansa's fare class rules the same.
2. Do y'all think it's worth the extra $300 pp to ensure we are in the appropriate class for an upgrade?

But in part I also am wondering what the chances are of actually getting the upgrade in the end. On United's website, the fare class buckets for this flight show as follows:  J4, C4, D4, Z4, P4, O6, A6, R6, Y6, B6, M6, U6, H6, Q6, V6, W6, S6, T6, L6, K6. I've researched this a ton and not really found great answers on exactly what fare class I need to ensure an upgrade (I do know that he'll need to call and change my flight number to the LH native number) and what effect a GS member using a GPU might have on that. Can someone clear that up for me?

I think my friend would be able to call the GS hotline to get answers to these questions, but he's already being so generous with offering us his GPUs that I don't want to bother him any further and wanted to see if anyone here has had experience with this!! Thanks so much in advance!",1546997198.0

How to determine number of business class seats available?,4,ad8nah,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/ad8nah/how_to_determine_number_of_business_class_seats/,15,"Hi,

I'm looking to use miles to upgrade a flight from San Francisco to Melbourne however I don't believe United offers confirmed upgrades at booking for these flights, so it would be waitlist. My plans are flexible by a couple of days so I'm trying to figure out what day gives me the best chances for the upgrade.

&nbsp;

I know using the seat chart isn't reliable to see the number of actual business seats available, but I'm not exactly sure how to tell from the fare classes. 

I believe the business fare classes are: J, JN, C, D, Z, ZN, P, PN, PZ, IN, I but not sure if one class shows the total number of seats available or if I need to add a couple of the classes together for the total.

&nbsp;

Hoping someone on here can help clarify, thanks!",1546830670.0

My sad farewell to United after 18 years flying United. Thanks for all you did.,7,acvn4u,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/acvn4u/my_sad_farewell_to_united_after_18_years_flying/,11,"I've flown United on long haul international flights, multiple times a year for 18 years. Have hundreds of thousands of miles on them.  I'm 6'3 and United changed the seat size on international some time in the last year. I simply don't fit anymore.

I spent a Japan to iad flight with my knees digging into the seat in front of me. And there was nothing I could do. I talked to an attendant and they said, in a fairly snarky tone ""we have industry standard seating."" It was literally painful.  The same flight attendant later saw as the person in front tried to recline, and the wince of pain on my face,  and she quietly comped an upgrade to a bulk head seat. I'm grateful for her change of heart. It was gracious and I forgot the earlier connect she made. But In the face of United's ever decreasing seat sizes, I'm now done with them.

Switching to Delta, I have several inches more room than United. And after 18 years, I didn't want to change so I wrote United a nice letter, tried to call, but no one wanted to listen.

Shortly after, on a long haul flight with Delta, I had a problem.  Nothing major, the lights wouldn't turn on on the bathroom. I mentioned it to the attendant and filled out a form explaining the problem. I got a personal call from Delta a few days later, apologizing and asking how they could make it right. I simply thanked them for the call, and said that continue to focus on their customers, that would be enough. I never recall getting a call from United.

Later, a flight from Asia came in earlier than expected and I called Delta on a whim, to see if they could put me on an earlier flight home. They did so without pleading and free of charge. United never did that for free, they always wanted a change fee plus the difference in cost. Two hours earlier, was never worth $300 to me.

I really did like United, they got me safely to and from work around the globe for years. I'm grateful for all their great staff... But I simply cannot fly with them anymore due to their seating, and I'm realizing corporate policies significantly restrict what their attendants and staff can do, to make the United experience more pleasant for flyers like myself. And since no one in the corporate office wanted to hear why a high mileage flier would suddenly change, I'm simply posting my reasons here. Perhaps someone up there might want to pay attention.

Farewell and thanks for all the fish.",1546735126.0

Hi.

&#x200B;

I've been taking UA on and off the past couple of years and this year, I've been working harder on being primarily a UA (& Star Alliance) customer to accrue miles and PQM/PQDs. I am trying to reach or aim for *Premier Silver* status under the Mileage Plus program next year. I know the 2 biggest perks of the *Silver* status is having the opportunity to get E+ for an E ticket purchase and a premier hotline. But my concern lies in the boundaries between *Premier Silver* and United Explorer card benefits.

&#x200B;

1. United Explorer Card - ""*Premier upgrades on award tickets*"" under travels. Exactly how does that work? Is this simply an E to E+ upgrade or is it an actual E or E+ to F/B?
2. United Explorer Card -  ""*Priority boarding*"" perk. What group would I board under this perk?
3. Premier Silver - ""*E to E+*"". Do I need to call or will I automatically be able to select an E+ seat at booking? or is it T-24 check-in? Check-in seems much harder to achieve for an E to E+ ""upgrade"".
4. Premier Silver - ""*E to E+ for yourself and companion under PNR*"". Is this 100% true to happen? If so, do I need to call premier hotline or can we both select E+ seats? Is this at booking or T-24 check-in?

Plus - with United having the most uncomfortable seats in economy in the business, I am eager to try out new carriers. 

Now that earning miles through United's MP is off the table - the time seems to be right to start utilizing Delta, American and Southwest more frequently.  

I understand that I am not the ideal consumer for United (spending less than $10k annually on the airline) - but is does seem to be a bit of a short-sighted business model. Am I missing something?

Already at the mornings we saw that our flight was delayed and we will miss the connection to Germany.

So we asked to get an earlier one. The best flight was leaving about 1pm so we would have plenty of time to get our connection. So what we got?

2 Tickets confirmed and 2 on a waiting list (low priority) so we didn’t get a place on that plain.

Next person from United Airlines did a better job. He gave us again two tickets and and two on the waiting list on first position. We got that plain. But missed the connection:

Now at costumer service at San Francisco:
We were offered to sit SEPARATE on the next plain. The personal said “you should be happy to get a seat”.  We declined because we didn’t want to flight over 10h on a worse plain(not dreamliner).

Then we asked to next flight just 1h later that is offered on the united airlines website an operated by Lufthansa. It was harshly declined.

So we are forced now to take a plane at 16:55 pm to Frankfurt. 

We will miss our already booked trains to the other city (300€ ). No compensation was offered like a flight to our target city. 

Now the best part comes. We were first offered a hotel one room for 4 persons. For 4 adults (since one reservation).  Only after strong complaints we got two rooms.

And finally we were told that it’s company s policy that id we want our baggage, we habe to wait 3hours and take them ourself. Instead of maybe bringing them to the hotel? That was not at the table.

&#x200B;

I have previously booked IAH-AMS via 3rd party (Priceline) with Lufthansa via FRA/UA on the return. I have an opportunity to purchase a 3 month mileage plus gold pass and have a few questions, hope someone can help. Many thanks in advance!

&#x200B;

Because the booking was made through a 3rd party, will the gold status retroactively apply to the reservation I currently have for IAH-AMS? Traveling on 12/26.  Assuming it does, am I correct that all gold benefits will apply (E+, same day ticket change, club pass)? This seems like an easy way to have these benefits applied to a low cost ticket, and potentially change connecting flight in FRA to an earlier one, as I currently have an 8 hour layover.

United bait and switch?,1,a0kzxp,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/a0kzxp/united_bait_and_switch/,2,"So this page popes up after I purchased my flight to Shanghai. As you can see, there are 3 options available. I automatically get on the upgrade for 1st while traveling in the United States, so #1 and if available #4 never get my attention. However, #2 and #3 did get my attention. $9,999.00 for 1st class from San Fransisco to Shanghai and the return flight for $133.00. This was so crazy, I took a screen shot and purchased the $133.00 PVG to SFO leg.

About an hour later I realized I did not get a seat assignment for the upgraded seat. I looked in my inbox and there was 4 emails from United. The first 2 were for the original purchase and the second 2 were confirming the upgrade I purchased. All was correct on the invoice and confirmation yet there was no mention of a seat. I decided to go online to my  mileage plus account and look at my trip and I see they upgraded me on the last leg from San Fransisco to San Diego.

I called United and they said I need to file this with customer service online so that's what I attempted. After many attempts to submit online but getting denied because the dates were in the future, I called United again. After another hour of discussions, the manager said, you have to wait until after the trip to complain, there is no way for them to do anything. She then said I could try driving to the airport and see what the check in desk could do.

How can they sell an upgrade, send 2 emails confirming the exact upgrade was charged to my credit card and another one confirming the completed upgrade for the PVG to SFO leg, then say sorry our computer now shows you bought the SFO to San Diego????

Bought what was offered and switched to something I did  not want with the answer being that I can't complain until after I take the flight.....

Missed my family vacation flight but managed to remediate the situation through UA customer service,3,9xpq24,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/9xpq24/missed_my_family_vacation_flight_but_managed_to/,2,"
So I travel every week for work (with Denver being home base) and reached 1K status this week! But last night my flight from BOS-DEN was delayed and I didn’t get home until 3am, had to move my car, take my skis off and put them in my apartment and get ready for an 8:15am flight to Vegas with my family 5 hours later. I woke up at 6am, after 2 hours of sleep, and despite my best efforts I passed out again and my alarms didn’t go off, putting my wake up time at 10am MST.

I woke up to a million missed calls from family and friends wondering where I was and the top push notification was that my flight to Vegas had landed. I immediately called the 1k line and opened with the overly dramatic “I’m super freaked out and don’t know what to do”, prepared to buy a new ticket or use miles to meet my family in Vegas.

The customer service desk was so helpful and put me on both the standby for a 2:30pm flight and confirmed me for a 4:30pm flight, and told me to do whatever I can to get to the airport and be ready to jump on a standby flight. Checked in again at the counter to get my standby ticket and I got moved to the front of the standby line because of my 1k status. 

I am here hours before any of my flights at the United lounge just getting wasted to forget how much I screwed up, and I’m not trying to brag (even though it comes across like that) but wanted to share a positive story about how United customer service at every step of the way stepped in to make sure I got to spend the most amount of time with my family, with no extra cost or change fees (even though it was an award ticket)

I know a lot of people hate on United because of customer service, so I wanted to share my story of how well it worked today. And I also acknowledge that much of my “luck”  can be attributed to my status, but I have been delayed, canceled, crammed into small seats all along my journey to 1k so I finally feel justified in my years of loyalty to this airline. Also keep in mind my flight last night from Boston was supposed to land at 9pm and ended up landing at 2am, so it’s not all rosey. 

Anyone else have fun customer service stories?

Issue with united automatically checking you into to both legs of your trip that contains a connecting flight when you check in to the first flight?,1,9ok94v,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/9ok94v/issue_with_united_automatically_checking_you_into/,1,"I try to avoid connecting flights like the plague if I can help it but lately I have had some travel the required connections. Say my itinerary is: 0600 IAD - 0659 ORD, then 0855 ORD - 1041 FSD. 24 hours before my flight I checkin to my 0600 flight and I am able to select my complimentary E+ seat. well for some reason the united app, website, whatever I happen to be using at the time also checks me into my connecting flight (the 0855 leg) which is weird because I am not within the 24-hour window yet for that flight - but it does and it gives me two boarding passes. no big deal right, it ends up saving me time from having to check in to the 2nd leg later right? well no, its not alright and I think it is a big deal because united won't allow me to select my complimentary E+ seat at that time b/c I am not in the 24 window for the 2nd leg - so WHY does united check me into that leg of my trip at all?? this is so infuriating because then the only way I can get my complimentary E+ seat on the 2nd leg of my trip (the 0855 connecting flight) is to wait until I am within that 24-hour window, but then I have to CALL the united premier desk or go to a united customer service counter because I am already technically checked-in to that flight and united app/website won't allow me to change my seat after I have checked in. Once I get a hold of a united rep on the phone or at the counter they say they have to UNCHECK me out of my flights, so that they can change my seats to get me the complimentary E+ seat for the second leg, then I have to re-checkin from the app so that the boarding passes appear on my phone. I have had to call united for this exact situation 3 times within the last 2 months and it is pure madness! twice the united reps who helped me told me to go into my united mileage account online and ""un select the auto checkin feature"" but I have looked all over my united accounted and there is no 'auto checkin feature' listed anywhere. then when I called the united premier desk for help they told me there is no such feature as ""auto checkin."" one rep tried to tell me to get around this issue: don't checkin to any of your flights until the 2nd leg (the 0855 leg in my example above) is within the 24-hour window. but then I might miss out on selecting the E+ seat I want for the 1st leg, and as others have previously pointed out - the time you actually checkin can be used as a tie breaker when determining your CPU eligibility so that particular bit of advice is completely asinine.

Im curious if anyone else has experienced this issue and if there is anything I can do to get around this other than having to call united customer service every single freakin time I have a flight with a connection. thanks!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: United automatically checks you into both legs of a flight when your trip includes a connecting flight, but only allows you to select your complimentary E+ seat for the leg that departs within 24-hours which necessitates you having to call united or go to a customer service counter in order to change your seat for the 2nd leg of your trip to the complimentary E+ seat",1539692478.0

worst customer service,3,9npkbb,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/9npkbb/worst_customer_service/,3,"\#UnitedAirlines, #worstcustomerservice

I intentionally purchased an initial flight (to Houston) that would only have me waiting 2.5 hours before my next flight-- this cost me an extra $80. About a month before I was leaving on my trip, United decided to cancel both flights I had booked… they called it “rescheduling”. My definition of rescheduling entails the departure time shifting from 7 pm to 8 pm, however United simply didn’t offer a flight around that time-frame any more. So they offered to refund my money, but when I looked into other options I had none that didn’t involve rebooking three other flights on two other airlines as well. So my only option was to take a morning flight that was $80 cheaper and left me with an 8 hour layover in Houston.

I ended up paying $550 for a flight that should have cost $300 (first class was about $650) without getting reimbursed the extra money I had originally spent on a more convenient flight (that was “rescheduled”).

Over the next month I called United at least three times, emailed them a couple times, and left a voice message with the customer care department. I did get one response stating I would get a “delay letter” but it never came. I had simple questions. Can they do something about the extra $80 I paid? Will I get reimbursed for the hotel I had to stay in because of the cancellation of my return flight? And those questions were never answered.

That’s only part of my complaint. When I got to the airport to fly to Houston, I told a lady representative of United about my situation and was basically told she couldn’t help me. As I am checking in and I am handed my boarding pass it says I am in row twenty-something. I told the lady I had paid for the first row and for economy plus. She told me her system doesn’t show that. I show her my email confirmation with the seat selection, and she acted like I must have created that email myself and it was completely bogus. She called someone else over and I explained the situation once again, and got the same response. Then she was said something along the line “I’ll do you a favor and put you in that row so you will be a happy customer!” Giving me what I paid for is not doing me any favors!

Furthermore, on the plane with a $500 ticket, there was no TV, no port to listen to music, no power port, no sort of entertainment whatsoever!

When I got to Houston, I saw a United Airline Customer Service Center and decided to talk to them, to see what I need to do, or what they can do for me. There was no difference in their response… also “sorry I can’t do anything”. I decided to fly business class on the next leg of my journey and while waiting for the ticket agent to issue the new ticket I explained some of the issues I was having. She told me to try the people inside the Polaris Club, they might be able to help. Nope, they weren’t any different. But when I did ask about the reimbursement for a hotel she said just get what I can afford and they  will pay me back what they thought would be a reasonable amount. She said they couldn’t give a dollar amount because some people take advantage of that and get the most expensive room possible.

Fast Forward to my return flight home, I arrive and get my hotel room. At the airport the next morning I tell the lady assisting customers checking in I will have issues because of how United rebooked me. She insisted there is nothing she can do and its whatever the computer says, finally after having to insist a couple times to talk to someone who would be able to help me, she directed me over to another counter. They lady there to said it’s whatever the computer said and go and check in. I go and check in, and once again I was assigned a seat at the back of the plane, after I had booked and paid to be in the front row. Once again I showed her my reservation showing I booked the front row and paid for it, once again she was like nope my computer doesn't show that so you didn’t! After insisting some more and showing her the email from United and my credit card statement (granted this only showed the total amount) she was like well so you will be happy I will put you in the front row as a gesture of good will! Seriously, no you just gave me what I paid for!

My flight home was absolutely no better than one going to Houston, absolutely pathetic.

I decided to email United one more time, and stipulated if I didn’t get someone who could actually answer questions I'll just file a dispute with my credit card.  I finally got a response other than “sorry I can’t help”! But it was tough luck, there was “no discussion to be had” and they refused to reimburse me for anything. She offered a voucher for a gesture of goodwill, but seriously?! What kind of gesture is that? The voucher they were offering me would involve spending another $500 and United would take only $100 off and that is still only if I use the voucher within 3 months. So what with the cost of the ticket and all the extra incidentals, my flight from Tucson to Houston was the same cost as the flight from Houston to Istanbul and to Rome and back: $1000! Worse still, I never received an apology until I said I would never fly United again, and they simply said that they were sorry to hear that.",1539418538.0

A Bunch of Questions,2,9jghdq,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/9jghdq/a_bunch_of_questions/,4,"Hello, I am a first-time flyer about to embark on a solo flight from the east coast to central USA. I don't really have much in the way of experienced fliers that I know personally so I hope someone on Reddit can help me. My questions are as follows:

I purchased a Basic Economy ticket on United's website, meaning I can only bring a 9X10X17 personal item on board with me. From what I understand there is a bag check area before the security checkpoint at every airport. What does this area do specifically? Is this area the place you go to drop your luggage off so they can place it in the cargo hold of your flight? That can't be because it'd need to pass through security first right?

In addition if I check in online 24 hrs before the flight I will need to visit the airport to 'prove' that I don't have anything but a personal item is what I hear. Is this true? I have a round-trip ticket and I can't feasibly go to the airport 24 hrs before my flight that takes me back home. What can I do here? Just go to the airport and not complete my check in online for that second flight?

So if my information is correct I will: Check in online the day before my first flight and will have to travel to the airport's United bag check-in area to prove my 'luggage-less' status if I want to complete my check-in early. Then a day later I arrive 2 hours early with my e-boarding pass thus allowing my to skip immediately to security where I keep my personal item with me at all times. Then upon my return flight I'll have to manually receive my boarding pass at that airport's bag check-in area because I can't prove my luggage-less status by going to that airport a day early this time around.

Is all this correct? I'm sure most who see this won't have a clue. These little details you can't find my Googling and are quite frustrating. It's the little things, you know? Ugh

Kudos to United Airlines,11,9g7mvh,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/9g7mvh/kudos_to_united_airlines/,1,"Today, I was returning home from vacation.  About 2 hours into the flight from PDX to ORD, a passenger two rows behind me started having chest pains.  The flight attendants quickly attended to the him. One of of his coworkers on the flight was a former EMT and jumped right in.  As his health deteriorated, the flight attendants asked over the speaker system is if there was a doctor onboard.  There was along with his daughter who was a nurse.  The doctor dad and nurse daughter quickly assessed the situation and had the flight attendants ask if there were any passengers onboard carrying nitroglycerin. There was and it was administered to the ailing passenger.  

The passenger’s health continued to deteriorate and he was move to the front of the cabin and laid down on the floor.  Shortly after, the man stopped breathing and had no pulse. CPR was immediately started. The onboard AED was used 3 times, unable to revive the passenger.  The EMT did a mitochondrial chest thump and the man’s pulse return very faintly. They hit him again with the AED and his pulse started getting stronger.

The flight was diverted to Billings, Montana for an emergency landing. By the time the plane landed, the man was alert and breathing on his own. Another coworker of the man left the plane to go to the hospital with him. 

After the emergency landing, we continued to ORD. When we landed at ORD, the captain spoke over the speaker system thanking the individuals involved with resuscitating the passenger.  The captain said that he was informed the man was out of the operating room in Billings and recovering in ICU.  The captain also said that United was able to contact the gentleman’s family and was covering the cost to immediately fly them to Billings so they could be with him.  United was also going to cover the cost of the hotel for the coworker who stayed behind and put him on another flight tomorrow so he could continue with his journey.

United doesn't care about its customers!!!,0,9ergi1,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/9ergi1/united_doesnt_care_about_its_customers/,6,"On August 28, 2018 I flew with United from Vancouver to New York. As this was a relocation from Canada to the US, I had a bit of luggage that I was bringing with me. One of my checked luggage was my Wacom Cintiq Digital Drawing Tablet.

As an animator/digital artist, I require this device for work and thus took great care to wrap and package this as I was greatly dependent on it for my income. I wrapped the tablet multiple times in bubble wrap and even padded it between two pillows just in case there was impact. The entire package was then sealed up and labeled as fragile.

Fast forward to August 29th, over a day later, after a long flight with delays that resulted in a missed connection and a night spent in Chicago, I finally arrived in NYC. I collected my bags and went to my new apartment, and started unpacking. As I was unwrapping my Cintiq tablet, bits and pieces started falling out of the packaging. The tablet and the stand that holds it was completely destroyed. The power button fell out as I was unwrapping it. A solid piece of metal that was part of the base had snapped off. My $1600 equipment, which I need to make an income, was completely unusable.

The very next day, I contacted United and filed a claim to report the damages done to my luggage. On September 5th, I made my way back to LaGuardia airport to show the damages to the United agents. I explained to them all that I had done to ensure that it was protected during the flight. Explained to them that it was essential to my work. Explained to them that it cost $1600. The United agent then proceeded to tell me that although items may be marked fragile, all that means is that they ""TRY"" to handle with a little more care, but that in order to make sure they get all the luggage onto the flight, they have to then stack luggage on top of each other in no particular order, fragile or not. On top of that, ALL the luggage ends up on the same conveyor belt that has sweeping mechanical arms that smack the luggage around as they're separated into their designated areas. Essentially, marking anything as FRAGILE doesn't mean anything.

I then proceeded to ask if there was anything that could be done and all I was offered was a $50 flight voucher (initially it was $35, but the agent changed her mind after seeing the incredulous look on my face when she stated it). That goes to show about how much they cared. In shock I went home. My brother tried to help me out and called United on my behalf. After a long discussion with United claims department, they told him they could give me a $150 flight voucher. First, that just goes to show that they could have offered more but didn't feel the need to despite how critical this loss was for me. Second, what need did we have for a flight voucher, regardless of the value ($150? that's just laughable compared to what I lost), from an airline that I was NEVER going to use EVER again. So we told them no that we didn't want the flight voucher. So here I am writing this to let others know how much this company cares about you and the service they provide. I will never fly United ever again.

I dig United Airlines,6,99mrn1,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/99mrn1/i_dig_united_airlines/,1,"I flew from California to New York and back with United. I have to say, I was impressed at their service. I needed to tell someone and figured this was my shot since I don't really go off on a rant too much. 

I had a trip with my girlfriend to Sequoia national park that led to a quick pack and leave situation for me to get to SFO from where I was. I drive up to the airport. I could have been earlier I'll say. I had to drop off my pup at my cousin's house. 

I got to the airport, get my ticket and head off to TSA. At TSA, I realized I've lost my driver's license somehow.  I was already cutting it close with getting onto the flight.

The TSA rep takes for fucking ever to get me a pat down and search my stuff. I'm not saying it's wrong but it took forever. It was my fault. Regardless, I miss my flight. So I head back to United which got me another ticket. 

I missed that flight. I underestimated how long the search would take. 
Got another ticket. Took that flight. Got to my destination. 

On the trip back, I will say United cancelled my flight. I understand. I was in the Air Force as a C-130 mechanic for 7 years. It kind of sucked to cough up the bucks for the hotel, but whatever. 

I missed that flight. Not because of the ID. But because I slept while literally at the gate. My sleep schedule was off canter with the switched flight times and what not. Whatever. 

Again, I go to United - They get me on the next flight. 

3 missed flights. Regardless of the situation, I just wanted to say thank you to the employees that work here. They were happy to help me at every problem. At the same time, not once was I interrogated as to why I missed the flight. United just wanted me to get onto the next one so I got to where I needed to be. 

Thanks

I travel around 40-60k per year by car and stay at a lot of hotels (been a Diamond Member with Hilton for 4 years).  However I only had status (Silver) with United 1 time in 2014. When they made changes around 2016 I always got close but never made it to Silver. 

Anyways I just got silver and suspect I’ll get close to Gold but won’t make it. Anything to be aware of?

Side note: I was soooo pissed when Hilton got rid of their “double dip” where I earned 10 points per dollar spent with Hilton and miles with United.

Terrible Experience with United,11,909jfp,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/909jfp/terrible_experience_with_united/,3,"This is adressed towards United. 

I’m writing to recall our disastrous experience with United Airlines on Sunday, July 15th and Monday, July 16th traveling from Cancun, Mexico to Newark, USA. Our original flight 1051 was not only continuously delayed but also cancelled and rescheduled without any proper notice. 

Initially, the 2:35pm flight was delayed by 2 hours, then 2 more, then an additional hour to 7:35pm local time. My family of six along with our six month old infant planned our departure from our resort accordingly, but were suddenly notified that the flight time was pushed forward to 6:15pm that very day.  By no means did this give us adequate time to reach the airport to make the newly scheduled time - an hour and twenty minutes earlier than we were told - since we had arranged to make the 7:35 time, but nonetheless we rushed to the airport in fear of missing our flight. 

After barely making it by 6:15 for the rescheduled flight, we were notified that the flight was delayed and we had no need to undergo the stress we did in order to get to the airport. A thirty minute delay turned into forty five minutes, then an hour, then almost an hour and forty minutes. Throughout this time, there was nearly no communication from United representatives regarding the delay, our flight status, or when we should figure out alternate accommodations for ourselves. In the midst of this all, we were unable to feed and change our infant’s diaper because we were led endlessly from place to place and were not sure when we would suddenly have to get on the next available flight home. 

We were finally informed that our flight was cancelled due to operational difficulties, almost 6 hours after our originally scheduled departure time. Some passengers ran to another gate though the rest of us had no idea why. We would later find that these passengers were told by United representatives to run to the other gate to try and make that flight if they could. Again, no announcement was made about any of this and we were left clueless as to what was going on. 

We were told that our flight would be pushed until 10am the following morning and we’d be picked up by a 7:30am shuttle when we repeatedly asked a United representative to give us more information. This did not leave an adequate window of time for any of us to call out of work, but we had no other choice. This is when the stream of disrespect from United staff ensued. Passengers on the same flight as us were put up in hotels of much better caliber, but we understood that we needed to stay wherever there was availability. However, it is not acceptable that we had to ask numerous times for our family to stay in the same hotel. We had no intention of splitting up, especially with the uncertainty of where we would be going, but the staff was dismissive and insisted we had no choice. Thankfully, we ended up finding three rooms in the same resort. When we asked about our accommodations for the night, we were essentially laughed at by representatives when they told us that the hotel we would be put up in (Adhara Resort) “wasn’t nice” and “didn’t have good food”. After a long day of disappointment, you can imagine that this would be incredibly rude and off-putting to us when we simply wanted to know where we would be sleeping that night. This lack of professionalism and general disregard for our comfort and dignity is directly in violation of what United tauts as their core values. 

We finally reached our hotel just to find that the United staff was correct about its quality.  Of the three rooms we stayed in, two of them did not have a working air conditioner. Our infant was in one of these rooms and suffered through the heat all night. Aside from this, the room was filled with mosquitoes and it is safe to say it was a sleepless night for all of us. 

The next morning, we anticipated a smooth ride to the airport and a timely flight, but we were mistaken. Around 7:15am, we received notification that our 10am flight had been pushed up to 9am. Never in all of our years of traveling have we seen a flight time moved forward not just once, but TWICE in a span of twelve hours. Our shuttle rushed to the airport and we barely made it by 8:10am, ten minutes before boarding time for the new 9am flight. 

As if this experience had not been enough of a nightmare, we began to check into our new flight. This is when we saw on our new boarding passes that three of our passengers were moved forward to the 9am flight and 3 were left on the 10am flight. We immediately went to the desk to let them know that under no circumstances was our family to be split up. However, United member Roman Dominguez told us nothing could be done and encouraged the three passengers on the 9am flight to rush and try and make it through security and board the flight. Even in such circumstances, we were not escorted through security to cut the line despite our requests. Three of us left, unsure if and when the rest of our family would make it home. 

Meanwhile, United representatives were still giving the rest of our family a hard time. Staff member Patty Amora quite literally chastised us, asking why we didn’t arrive on time for a 9am flight and speaking to us with no decency whatsoever. By no means were we accountable for the events that transpired, and if United sent a shuttle at 7:30am for a 9am flight, I’m not sure what fault we were at in the situation. 

Our three passengers made it, boarding passes in hand, to the 9am flight. Upon reaching the gate, United staff members were incredibly confused. When they scanned the boarding passes, they read as “unavailable” - because they were on the 10am flight too! At the desk, Patty Amora had switched our entire party to the 10am flight without even saying a word to us, seeing that half of our party had departed. 

As loyal customers who have been traveling with United for years, we’re incredibly disappointed not only with the lack of informed communication from the airline, but also with the way we were spoken to by airline representatives. The cumulation of events was stressful enough to begin with, but the fact that representatives were not willing to talk to us to keep us updated on our flight status was unacceptable. The times we were able to speak with someone, the information they gave us ended up being incorrect and we wasted an entire 24 hours being misguided.",1532061533.0

Bags Delayed for 6 Days and Counting,3,8vmi4b,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/8vmi4b/bags_delayed_for_6_days_and_counting/,0,"On the morning of June 26 at O'Hare airport, I was supposed to be on a Delta flight to LAX. I paid $25 for a checked bag, but the employees forgot give me a bag tag. There were severe thunderstorms in the Midwest that day, resulting in many delayed flights, including mine. I booked a flight with one stop in Minneapolis. Although it was scheduled for 9:01 AM, it had not left Minneapolis since 6:00 AM and was expected to arrive at O'Hare around 1 PM. My connecting flight from Minneapolis to LAX would leave at 12:45 PM, so Delta transferred me to a nonstop United Flight at 11:00 AM. They said they would transfer my bags over, but United had no way to confirm because Delta forgot to give me my bag reference number. I could not go back because it was 10 minutes before boarding at that point. 
After arriving at LAX around 3pm, I realized that Delta indeed did not make it. I tried filing a report, but the United kiosk guy said I needed the bag number. So I walked from Terminal 7 to Terminal 3 (also separated by a Tom Bradley International Terminal) to the Delta kiosk. They told me my bag would be arriving on a Delta flight at 8 PM that same day. I didn't want to wait 4 hours, so I went back to United and filed the report for delivery. After seeing that my bag arrived via the tracker, I was relieved and expected it the next day. 
It was not delivered the next day.
I then called Delta. They told me that United had to make the effort to pick up my bag from them. So I then called United, requesting them to pick up my bag. 
Two days later, I see the bag is listed with the following:
Estimated Delivery Time By: 06/30/2018 10:30 PM
Current Status: Your Delivery Is Ready For Driver Pickup.
After not receiving my bags on the 30th, I give United another call. They contacted the delivery service and said my bags would be delivered by yesterday afternoon.
After not receiving my bag yet again, I check the tracker, which hasn't updated, and give United another call. They basically say/do the same as yesterday, except the delivery service and airport did not respond to their inquiry. 
My bag contains materials for a diorama I'm submitting for a contest on the 4th. They need at least 24 hours to set. At this point, I'm considering going to LAX in person and retrieving my bag myself, but the CS rep warned that the airport may not know where my bag is at the moment. I'm not sure what to do right now.
tl;dr Delta flight got delayed because of a storm, transferred to United but bag wasn't, Delta and United have known the whereabouts of my bag for the past 6 days but haven't done anything about it, not sure how to retrieve bag before too late.",1530596175.0

United airlines will steal your ticket home,6,8uwdhu,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/8uwdhu/united_airlines_will_steal_your_ticket_home/,16,"Last week, my company needed me to go to Columbus, then Boston to do a network upgrade.   
So I purchased my tickets from DC to Columbus for Monday during the day, then Columbus to Boston for Wednesday evening, and flying back from Boston to DC on Friday evening.  
So I get to the airport Tuesday, and as soon as I got there, it showed a 1hr delay on my flight.  No worries, I have the time.  
And hour later, another hour delay.  Then another 1.5 hr delay soon after.  United reps are telling us nothing, so I figure it is a weather issue.   
So then it is starting to get a little late, 9pm, and the flight was supposed to have landed in Columbus at 7pm, so I ask a rep.  And they told me there are mechanical issues on our plane coming from Charolette. I ask will we be flying today, and she said she was fairly sure we would.   
10pm rolls by, then 11pm.  At 11:30, the flight boards say our flight is cancelled.  And United reps go silent again.   We get in line at the gate to try to talk to a rep, and after waiting in line for about 45 minutes, the lady says she needs to go, and we need to talk to customer service.   Well that line is about 3-4 hours long because of the weather.  Finally at around 12:30am someone stops by and gives us a phone number to call so we don’t have to wait around unless we need a hotel (which I don’t know why they didn’t tell people, but all of the local hotels were booked hours ago, so those people waited for nothing).    
I go home and call the number.  I ask to have my flight changed to Wednesday, but the earliest they have isn’t flying out until 5pm, landing at 7pm.  My flight from Columbus to boston is supposed to take off at 5:30 from Columbus, so that won’t work.   

So I call my boss, and he said to see if I can transfer my ticket to go directly to Boston instead, and we would come back to take care of Columbus later in July.  

I call them back and explain I’d like to transfer my ticket from DC to Columbus for a ticket from DC to Boston instead and to fly out Thursday so I have time to finish before my flight back Friday night.  She takes a look and says that the flight from DC to Boston is $55 more which makes sense.  But they would waive the $200 transfer fee since my flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues.  So I pay the extra $55, and I have the trip sorted out.   

So I fly to Boston the next day, and do my work.  When I get back to the hotel I hop onto my United app, and try to check-in.  But the app isn’t finding my flight.  So I call them up.  

A rep gets on, and tells me to hold for a moment while they check this out.  A few minutes later, they get on and say “You made your flight a one-way yesterday”.   
I told him, no that is a mistake, I would have never given up my way home.  And I never called yesterday, I called the day before.   They needed to fix this.  He said, sure we can fix it, you just need to pay us for this ticket again another $266.  
I said no, I already paid for the ticket, they need to fix their mess up.  And he refuses because he knows I am stuck in Boston with no way home, and eventually if I wanted to get home I would have to pay.   

I tell him I want to speak to a manager.   A few minutes later the phone comes back on (but it sounds exactly like who I was speaking to before, and they say they are a manager).  Is it Fraud to impersonate a manager?   
Anyway, they get on and ask me how I would like to pay.  
I explained exactly word for word what happened and they ignore every word.   
I ask him, if he were in my position, would he just bend over and take this sort of abuse?   Would he accept being lied to, having your ticket stolen, then being forced to pay for a ticket already paid for?   He stayed silent.   
I asked him, is them screwing me over for $266 really worth losing the business of a firm with over 500 employees who fly a lot? Or worth losing money from a disgruntled customer who will tell everyone exactly how they treat their customers?   Again silence.   Are you still there? I asked, and I did get a response then.   

So I tried another approach.   I pulled up how much I spent.  
I paid $215 for my flight from DC to Columbus (originally was flying from Columbus to Boston on Delta so I didn’t mention that one) then another $255 for the flight from Boston home to DC, then an additional $55 to transfer my ticket from Columbus to Boston.  So I spent a total of $525 and all I got out of it was a flight from DC to Boston.  And now they want me to pay an additional $266 to get home.    That would be nearly $800 total, and I wasn’t given first class or even business class.  But instead they stuck me beside this very large woman who paid for 2 seats. So they screwed her over too in this situation.   

So since I could not get home any other way other than by letting United Fuck me, I was forced to pay the $266 to get home.   

I am now making it my mission to make make sure that United at least does not get anymore money from me or my company, and will tell anyone and everyone I know to avoid United at all cost because given the chance they will fuck you over any way they can, at any opportunity they can.   

The CS rep I spoke to had the opportunity to fix a mistake, and make a customer happy.  I would have gone to every social media sight I’m on to sing their praises for helping me out.   But they took that opportunity, spit on it, wiped their ass with it, and told every customer that they only want to squeeze as much money out of you as possible even if they have to lie, and steal to do it.

Management played favoritism so hard that I fell into deep depression and contemplated the unthinkable. The final straw was when I tried seeking assistance at United through HR about management corruption only to get nothing but a cold shoulder. I had to seek professional help. The only thing that held me through those times were my friends' encouragement to leave the company.

The story:
I had a flight out of Atlanta to DC cancelled due to *reasons* which then prohibited me from getting on my flight from DC to Lisbon later that evening.  They redirected us from ATL to Amsterdam with a flight shorty after to Lisbon so in total maybe a 5-6 hour difference then our original landing time, not bad I get it I understand the only bad thing was the seat situation but once again I’m happy I’ll be getting there. Land in Amsterdam go to the gate of the next flight but they say my GF has a ticket on the next plane but I don’t because the flight was overbooked. They direct us from one ticket counter to the next because United didn’t have any representation at the airport that day. Get on customer service only for them to keep trying to rebook us on TAP even though I’m at Swissport’s , TAP’s, handling agency only for them to tell us those flights are also booked and the same thing will happen. Eventually we get booked tickets for the earliest morning flight the next day, I have our boarding passes printed out at the airport before we leave. The morning of the next flight we get to the ticket gate of the boarding flight only for the gate agents to say that I don’t have a ticket for that flight even though I have a printed ticket in my hand. Eventually ,after I forced my gf on the flight, I was told that due to some error my ticket reservation was deleted at some point in time. I then go to the United ticket agent and they tell me it wasn’t their fault it was TAPs BUT they would not book me on the next earliest flight which was with Vueling, they said I had to take TAP it was their issue that I wasn’t able to get on the flight. I am not sitting in the Amsterdam airport with another physical ticket for a flight I hope I can get on.  So maybe this saga isn’t over yet but I have a lot of time to kill in the meantime.

Things I’ve done so far:
1) email United and basically say the same story as above. 
2)call United but they keep saying I have to fill out a survey, when that comes to me. 
3) go to the Swissports counter, TAP’s handling agency, about compensation for not being on the flight. Per the representative I have to call TAP
4) Try to call TAP but I don’t have ticket confirmation numbers as United was the one doing the booking

I feel like I am reasonable and understand these things happen. So any tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated.",1527174368.0

I tried to fly with United Airlines on the 22nd of February from Melbourne to Vancouver. The pilot hurt herself before takeoff and United were unable to find a replacement.

I was told to take a taxi across the city to stay in a hotel provided by United. I was told the costs of taxis would be reimbursed ($200) along with any other costs i incurred (food and transfers $200.)

I eventually flew 24 hours later and I was told my the airline that I would be reimbursed once I emailed them on their website. The journey was terrible. As i flew 24 hours later I missed my transfers, arrived in a blizzard so was delayed for several more hours. Total travel time was 65 hours. I even spent an extra $500 on this flight to minimise my travel time.

I have tried emailing United three times over the last 4 months and have not received any response. I am disappointed they have not been proactive in remedying their mistake and I am outraged that they havnt been reactive in reimbursing me.

I am unsure what to do next. I would like to take legal action and would like to know which body I should complain to. Im not really that bothered about the money at this point, its just the principle and i'd like to warn others about how bad their customer service is.

Ive received no response despite being told I was due compensation and despite waiting 4 months.

I hope someone has some help on this.

The flight was UA99 from Melbourne - LA - Vancouver on 22nd February 2018.

Forgot item on the plane. Was told cleaners would throw it away instead of turning it in to lost and found.,7,8928d7,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/8928d7/forgot_item_on_the_plane_was_told_cleaners_would/,3,"UA 340: Dulles to SFO, yesterday. At baggage claim my wife realized she must have left her jacket on the plane so we went to ask for help. After waiting for the two available clerks to finish having a personal conversation we were able to ask them to see if they could call the gate and help us search for it. The plane would likely still be unloading our fellow passengers, so it should not have been a problem. The clerks said No and handed us a paper with a generic United Airlines web address on it. Kind of useless. They told us to go the website and report it. We protested, as of course we were at the airport right then and the plane was right there, and so too was the jacket we left. There was no reason for them not to pick up the phone and check. They insisted it was company policy, but that we could check the lost and found later. 

This upset me so I tried to call customer support. The women on the phone simply called the clerks we had just spoken with and and relayed back the same message about the website. Customer support proved to be both uninformed of company policy at the airport and a generally useless service as well. I asked if I could speak to a manager at the airport and this time a supervisor on the phone was unwilling to provide me the contact information.

After going to pick up our car we decided before leaving the airport that we should check one more time. Maybe the jacket made it to lost and found. 

Two new clerks were at the post by this time, and they exclaimed that we “should have checked sooner” as the plane had left the gate by now. We told them about our previous encounter, pointing out we had attempted to seek help immediately but were sent to a website instead of provided service. The clerk this time was kind enough to call the gate and ask if anyone had found anything. But as expected, it was too late. The plane had left, staff had changed, and there was no clear evidence of our item being found. 

The clerk pointed out that the cleaners may report it to lost and found. So we asked if she could check, she did. It was no there. So I simply asked, “assuming they actually cleaned the plane, and did not steal the item, it should have been reported.”

The clerk agreed, but pointed out that the cleaners are not policed and “Often throw items away.” 

I’m livid. Obviously. 

1: Why were the first group of clerks unwilling to help us in the same way as the second group of clerks? Had they done anything at all we would not have lost our property, but they told us it was company policy to do nothing, which later proved to be untrue. 

2: How can a company knowingly allow their staff to throw away, or perhaps even steal their customers personal property? It was clear to the clerk that we would probably never see our property again. Even if it were found, no one in the company seemed to care. 

3: How can anyone feel safe on an airline who does not see fit to properly inspect the cabin of their planes before the next departure? The cleaners should not have had to find it first. Something as obvious as a jacket should have been nabbed by a flight attendant. 

4: How can we feel safe on an airline if the last people to be on our planes are unsupervised and essentially encouraged to be criminals, as in the case of United? 


This isn’t the first time we have left an item on the plane but it is the first time I realized it soon enough to take immediate action, and I am appalled at the lack of support I received. I was also troubled to find the reason why after filing the online forms for missing items in the past, that I received no response. As United Airlines never intended to respond.",1522720247.0

My wife and I were flying United Airlines from Wisconsin to Hawaii for our honeymoon just two days ago, and while on the runway ready for take off, the plane's generator malfunctioned and we were pulled back to docking. This was a flight from MKE to ORD (Chicago), then ORD to OGG (Hawaii). The delay made us miss the connecting flight in Chicago to Hawaii and so we had to rebook a new flights. Long story short we did not get to Hawaii until 8hrs later (landed at 11pm instead of the original 2:45pm) and missed the entire day, including multiple events that we paid for, as this was an all inclusive trip.

Are we entitled to compensation from United Airlines? I asked multiple  people at the airport and they told us they cannot do anything at the airport but gave a number to call.

Thus, I want to find a way to get her the true full experience that I think you only find on long haul intercontinental flights (labeled Polaris I guess with lay flat seats and such).

My research has turned up that you can use ""regional"" upgrades on flights to Oceania. I am in California. The trouble is, I don't see any united flights to places like Fiji, Tahiti, etc. Just partner airlines like air new zealand.

Any United experts know if I can use my regional points to upgrade to a true biz class somehow to Oceania or any others?

I doubt I will get to 1k status this year for global upgrade points ;)

Additionally, specialized pet transport services exist.  I used one once when I brought a pet back with me from living overseas.  It costs, but you're paying for the extra care they take to ensure your pet is safe at all times.

I know this is a wall of words, but read it anyway ... it contains
several suggestions for improvement.

My current work assignment is a full time technology consulting
project in Houston, so each week I fly round trip from my home base in Minneapolis.  My return flight on Feb 22-23 was interesting, to say the least:
https://weather.com/news/weather/video/united-flight-skids-off-icy-runway-in-green-bay-wisconsin

Yes, I recorded the video clips and that’s my voice you hear.  The Weather Channel did a nice job editing and adding dramatic music.  But that just shows the icing on the cake.  There's a lot more to it.

My timeline of events:

We boarded United flight 878 IAH (Bush Intercontinental) to MSP on Thursday, February 22, 2018 about 7:10 pm with a scheduled departure of 7:40 pm.

The flight was nearly full, a Boeing 737-900 with 200 people on board. I was wedged into 21E, a middle seat in an exit row, between two guys who weigh 300-400 pounds.  I’m not exactly svelte either, but these guys made me look small.

I showed the people around me how to turn off the seat-back
entertainment units that would otherwise be flashing annoying DirecTV ads for the entire flight. Protip: Hit the minus button that dims the screen until it reaches its lowest setting. Every flight should include these instructions. Little did I know we’d be glued to those little screens long after midnight.

We sat for about 30 minutes, then the pilot announced there was a mechanical problem and “this plane won’t be going to Minneapolis”. The crew instructed us to get off and await instructions for a plane change. The United app notifications told me it was a problem with air conditioning.  (8:15 pm)

I begged the counter agent to let me pay to upgrade to one of the several empty first class seats. Travel policy doesn’t allow
reimbursement for this, but I’d gladly eat the $79 cost of the upgrade I'd been offered in the United app when I checked in. “Sorry. We have to keep them empty because the plane isn’t balanced.” My brother does weight-and-balance verification for another airline, so I understand this can happen. My brother later told me this is typically done when the aft baggage compartments are out of service or very lightly loaded
with low-density cargo like flowers (he calls this a “fluffy load”). He also told me that when there is a plane change, he re-plans the loading of the plane from scratch. If those bins were not loaded due to a mechanical problem with the first plane, the load plan should have been revised for the second one.

Gate change. Checked again to see if maybe those first class seats were available, but no.  Boarded plane #2 and pushed off.  Same seat, between the same two guys.  Because we were seated in an exit row, the flight attendants must ask us if we are willing and able to open the emergency exit door.  The same attendant asked the same questions on both planes.  The second time around, I jokingly asked her “If I were to say ‘No’, would you move me to one of those empty seats in first
class?”  She furrowed her brow like a scolding school teacher and said “No, then we’d have to open the door.”  We all laughed and I said, “In that case, I’m a ‘Yes’.”

Plane departed IAH about 9:10 pm.

The tall 400 pound guy in 21D, who needed a seatbelt extender and spilled into my seat, said “You know you are kind of hot” (referring to my body temperature). I reply, “Thanks, I have my moments.” He’s actually a nice guy from Mississippi on his way to MN for a probate court hearing in the morning to settle the affairs of a relative who had passed away.  Spoiler alert: he won’t make it to the hearing. I recall him advising us not to die without a will.  Prophetic?

Scheduled arrival time at MSP was 10:40 pm but at that time we were somewhere over Iowa.  I had slept for an hour, and that power nap served me well through the adventure that was coming our way.

The plane arrived in MSP airspace at the height of a snowstorm (~11:15 pm)

Aborted landing attempt #1 and we circled for what felt like an hour. 

The plane’s seat-back entertainment units include a map and shows altitude and speed; I switched mine on out of curiosity. I wasn’t feeling very comfortable about all this low-altitude flying in icing conditions. Pilot announced we were running low on fuel and were diverting about 200 miles to Madison WI for fuel. (~ midnight)

The landing in Madison seemed harsher than average with loud landing gear noise and some twisting (crosswind correction?) at touchdown. Not the worst I’ve experienced, by far, but enough of a jolt to make a seasoned traveler go “Huh?”

Best part of the night … after we landed in Madison, the 400 pound guy in 21D jumped to the front of the plane and sat in one of the unoccupied first class seats.  Nobody said a word and he stayed there for the duration of the flight! (Friday morning, ~1:00 am)

After refueling, pilot announced he has to be back in the air within 35 minutes or FAA rules will ground him and we’ll be stuck in Madison. My phone’s weather.com radar forecast showed the storm wouldn’t be clearing MSP until after 4:00 am, I recall thinking this might not end well.

We flew 200+ miles back to MN, circled some more, and aborted landing attempt #2. Pilot announced that runway conditions left braking distances too long for safety, so we were done for the night and diverting to Green Bay (it is now roughly 2:30 am)

My immediate thought: ""Why are we flying EAST?  The storm is heading east.  Shouldn't we be pointing at Des Moines or Omaha?""  Steady rain fell in Green Bay on frozen ground.  Glare ice formed. There’s little-to-no air traffic at that time of night to report conditions.

If the pilot thought braking distances at MSP were bad, he sure had a nasty surprise waiting in Wisconsin.

During landing, touchdown was quite smooth. But I heard the thrust reversers at full throttle MUCH longer than normal and I also noticed the complete absence of the usual sounds, vibrations, and deceleration of brakes. I recall thinking ”Wow we’re using every bit of runway.” Then there were some mild bumps (like a car going over speed humps). The guy on my right looks out the window and said “Holy shit, were in
the weeds!” I later learned we stopped 250 feet past the end of the runway. It was a flat and grassy field, and the ground was frozen solid.  The plane wasn’t quite perfectly level, just a slight slant to the right.  (3:15 am)

Pilot announced that we had left the runway and would be staying put. Stairs and a bus had been requested. It is going to be a while.  A few passengers stood in the aisle, nobody seemed to be injured or even terribly upset. Emergency vehicles arrived on the left (port) side of the plane. The guy on my left said ""I am a huge Vikings fan.  Why Green Bay of all places?""

I submitted reports to the news tip lines of two Minneapolis TV
stations.  A reporter from KARE (NBC affiliate in Minneapolis) immediately called me.  I sent him video clips showing calm passengers and flashing lights outside, and he recorded an audio interview.  His report was forwarded to NBC News and to their Houston affiliate KHOU.

Plane is unloaded. The bus had a capacity of 60, so it took at least four trips to get everyone to the terminal. I was in the second group. I recorded a clip from the staircase and sent it to KARE (5:00 am). 

Crowd control was excellent at the plane, nobody could possibly wander off.  At the terminal, we were free to roam and people were scattered throughout the terminal.  One suggestion would be to announce a gathering spot in baggage claim where passengers can hear announcements.  Fortunately it isn't a very large airport.

200 passengers milled around 2+ hours waiting for baggage and further instructions.  United called in help and they handed out cinnamon rolls and bagel/egg sandwiches. I high-fived the 400 pound guy from Mississippi for having the nerve to sit in first class.  I receive messages requesting permission to use my video clips, which I granted to anyone who asked nicely (free, perpetual, and unlimited use … sure, why not?).  I was interviewed by Brandi -- you cannot make this stuff up -- Smith at KHOU, and she put together a nice segment for their
morning news show.
http://www.khou.com/article/news/local/houston-flight-to-minn-slides-off-runway-in-green-bay/285-522392079

About 8:00 am we were given the choice between a 5-6 hour bus ride to MSP or a hotel room for the morning followed by a 1:00 pm flight.  I took the hotel and flight option, but 2/3 of the other passengers went for the bus.  (Riding a bus across icy northern Wisconsin seemed particularly silly to me.  Planes are much safer.) . I was issued a room voucher, $10 meal voucher, and a boarding pass. The hotel shuttle
driver told me he was called in at 4:00 am and the hotel was expecting a much larger group; my guess is that United’s dispatcher tipped off the two nearby hotels to get ready for the full inbound jet before the runway excursion.

I slept for about two hours then returned to the airport at noon for the 1:00 pm flight.  United sent what seemed to be a brand spanking new 737-900 to Green Bay to pick about 60 of us up. The cabin crew looked younger than usual (newbies that just finishing training?) but quite professional and polished.  I had an entire row to myself. The weather was clear. The flight attendant didn’t ask for my credit card when I ordered a beer.

United has offered me the choice of a $300 flight credit that expires in a year or 15k miles.  The text from the apology on the customer care site is below.  Do you notice something missing? Zero acknowledgement that the plane left the runway.  Zero acknowledgement that a mechanical problem with the first plane caused us to fly into the worst of the storm. Sure the weather was involved, but there was plenty of poor efforts that contributed. I think I'll pass on this offer.

“We Apologize

I can understand your concern when inclement weather forced your flight to divert to Madison rather than continuing to Minneapolis/St. Paul, as scheduled. Once we were given clearance to depart for Minneapolis and were en-route, I understand that, due to further weather conditions, an additional diversion to Green Bay was required
and the flight subsequently cancelled.

Your safety is always important to us. I trust our staff was attentive to your needs and able to work with you in a pleasant, quick, and organized manner to offer alternate arrangements to get you safely to your final destination.“

But on the bright side, I survived a plane crash.

p.s. Hey United, the seat belt extender you gave the guy in 21D somehow wound up in my computer bag.  May I keep it as a souvenir? Otherwise, you can come pick it up. I am usually home on Fridays.",1519613162.0

"United wrongfully denied my wife and me clearance to fly, and we missed our flight. What can I do?",3,7wvfpf,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/7wvfpf/united_wrongfully_denied_my_wife_and_me_clearance/,0,"Thanks in advance for any assistance that you are able to provide, let me explain what happened. 

I'm travelling from Santiago, Chile to Indonesia via United. The first leg of my flight goes from Santiago to Houston. While checking-in, United staff told me they were unable to clear us to fly because we didn't have a ticket leaving the country within thirty days. In fact, we did have a ticket leaving within two months, and there is a perfectly legal option to extend a tourist visa for an additional 30-days once in Indonesia, which we were planning to do when we arrived in Indonesia. The company which helped us arrange the travel assured us that this is perfectly legal and they do it regularly, but the United desk in Santiago Airport was not able to clear us. They told us it was impossible for them to account for the extension, even after we showed them the Indonesian Embassy's website, which said that there was a perfectly legal way to extend a Visa-on-arrival. They said that without the 14-digit ticket number leaving Indonesia within 30 days of arrival, we wouldn't be allowed to board the plane. 

We were unable to contact the company which helped us arrange the travel, as it was about 4 in the morning Jakarta time. So we were without help. 

In order to try and board our flight, we immediately purchased flights out of Jakarta within 30 days from a smartphone. When we showed the booking to the United staff, they said that we were still unable to board, because the confirmation e-mail we received didn't contain the 14-digit e-ticket number. There was proof of purchase, a reference number, and an itinerary, but it seemed without the 14-digit ticket number we couldn't board the plane. 

We called the airline with which we purchased our flight out of Jakarta in order to get the ticket number, and they politely informed us that they only provide such details 2-weeks before departure, and there was nothing they could do.

Just to clarify, because it's confusing, we bought tickets leaving within 30 days from Jakarta. We showed the proof of purchase and confirmation to United, and it still wasn't enough to board the plane. What we were trying to do isn't illegal, and nowhere on the Indonesian Travel Requirements website does it even say that travelers must have purchased a ticket out of the country within thirty days. It says it's possible to extend a Visa-on-arrival to 60 days. 

As a consequence of this, we missed our flight, and had to call United and change the date of our flight. This cost us $600 in change fees. Additionally, we had to book a last-minute hotel and charter a taxi to it and stay there for three days until the next available flight. All of these additional charges totaled in the hundreds of dollars. We are not rich people. These charges set us back quite a bit. 

We believe that we were wrongfully denied boarding, and that we are owed compensation for this ordeal. We think that United's computer system couldn't account for our situation, and indeed our travel company told us that this hadn't been a problem with other airlines. What steps can I take to get help from United to rectify this situation? 

Again, thanks for your help and patience.

We hear nothing for weeks, and when we finally get around to calling them, they say they'll send us an email within 24 hours.
A few hours later we get an email which starts the conversation that follows:


Dear [us] 

I'm sorry you didn't receive a response to your previous inquiry. 

The notes stated that you weren't advised of the $2X fees per person when changing your ticket last year. When a change is made to a nonrefundable domestic ticket, there is a $X change fee per person and a fare difference may apply.  We send out an email immediately after making the change and ask our customers to review it and call us back right away if an error has been made. 

Regards, 
[United employee]

(to which we reply)


Hi [United employee] (or anyone else reading this),


Thanks for getting back to me. I wish the person to whom I spoke last year communicated the fees as you have.


I fail to see how United sending out an email immediately after making the change has any bearing on the fact that I was told, by a representative of United Airlines, that the price of changing my itinerary was half of its actual value and sold this change under false pretenses. If I'm following your logic, it seems you're saying I should have checked my email, reviewed the online receipt, etc. I am under no obligation to double check the work of United Airlines. I should have been quoted the correct price. I should have been immediately reimbursed after review of the call. And more importantly I should not need to go back and forth over what was clearly a blunder on the part of one employee, whose blunders should be shouldered by the organization employing him. To be clear, it appears United is in possession of a recording of an employee misrepresenting the price of a flight change and charging me double the stated amount.


When I first called about this error on the part of the United employee with whom I spoke, I was told that the recording would be reviewed to determine whether I was appropriately informed of the price of changing my itinerary and that after a review of the recording, proper action would be taken. It seems that after review, the notes have reached the conclusion that I wasn't advised of the fee amount. Because I was not properly advised of this fee before my purchase, and was in fact given false information by an agent of United Airlines, are we able to move to the topic of reimbursement? I am ready to provide any necessary information to expedite the process.


Regards,
[us]

The next day we called again because they're by no means trying to actively resolve the issue, and they said they would call us *the next* day (today). Well, we got a call but missed it because we were at work, and we got the following email:

Dear [us]

I'm sorry I wasn't able to speak with you a few minutes ago, and unfortunately I don't have a direct phone contact that I can be reached at. 

We regret you continue to be disappointed with our response.  As I stated in my voice message, the change fees and fare differences are per person.  Unfortunately we don't have the database to store calls for long as we get thousands every day. 

As we are human and we can make mistakes, it is always advisable to review purchases you make online or in this case, a change made to the reservation over the phone.  Since the fees are nonrefundable and we disclose them up front, we are not reimbursing anything nor are we providing compensation and consider this case closed. 

Regards,
[United employee]

As you can imagine, this is pretty frustrating, and a few hundred dollars worth of unfair. Their reasoning for not refunding us the money is based on non facts (we disclose prices upfront), and it seems like there's no real recourse. But I figure I'd bring my problem onto the internet to see if there's any way to fix it.

TL;DR Analogy: Say you go to a burger place, and you look at the menu, which doesn't have prices immediately available. You could look them up online, but you're talking to a cashier who says ""this costs $X"" and feel as though you can go around that part. You place an order, and (s)he gives you a total, looks at the register, and says ""that'll be $X."" You hand him the card, which he swipes, and a receipt is sent to your email. You then eat your burger, and sometime after, while checking your email, you see that you were charged $2X. How do you navigate? Say the burger is a flight change, and the place is United.

Why not just book on Air Canada you ask? Tried that, Online checkin works perfectly! The only problem is I while I earned the correct PQM I earned 0 PQD! For cheap flights who cares, but for flights that are expensive, this is problematic.

United booked me on airline that went bankrupt. Offering refund of $29.83.,7,7qv8ax,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/7qv8ax/united_booked_me_on_airline_that_went_bankrupt/,4,"Wondering if/how I should fight this.
Booked flight through Expedia.  All United flight numbers.
Try to check in through app, told to go to the airport to check-in.

Phoned United, system confirmed I was booked on three hops, and confirmed flight numbers, times, and that the first hop between Hawaiian Islands would be with Island Air.

Went to airport and checked in with United.
Rep can't find reservation, digs further, and informs me first hop is with Hawaiian Air, and I'll have to check-in with them.  In hindsight, there is no way the reservation she was looking at said that, pretty sure I was being made SEP (somebody else's problem)!

At Hawaiian Airlines they found my ticket was not valid as the airline they were for had gone bankrupt two months before.  Expedia did not notify me.  United, as of that morning, still had me on the bankrupt airline.

Hawaiian Airlines had room on their next flight.  If I phoned United or Expedia, the hold time, and getting it sorted, would probably make me miss connecting flights, so grabbed the seat.  $180.

Back home, phone United.  Told to talk to Expedia.  Phone Expedia, who say it's Uniteds fault.  Tell Expedia I booked through them, they didn't tell me of the change, they need to take care of this.  

Expedia phones United and gets them to process a refund.  United just emailed me that it will be a total of $29.83.

Should I say good enough? Talk to United?  Talk to Expedia?  Pretty sure it's just going to be a frustrating exercise, which is probably the whole point.  

In the end, it was my choice under pressure to solve their problem at my expense.  It's still beyond me why this wasn't fixed two months before when the Island Air went out of business, especially as it had a United Flight number tagged to it!?

I think I'll stay around a bit longer also.

I had the thought the other night about finding a way to bypass the need to co-pay and just use miles to upgrade international flights, where you would normally have to use a GPU, or some other instrument to upgrade. I have a trip to HKG in March that I want to explore the ideas of getting to Business in on their 777-300ER.

The idea came into using the idea of getting into the correct fare class with the SDC (Same Day Change) rules, along with the all fare classes evening out over T-2h from departure. This, and utilizing the MilagePlus Upgrade Awards. Upon checking into a flight from LAX>NRT this past year I noticed I had the same day buy-up offer, along with the Co-Pay with Miles option on the screen.

I think the ability for this to work, assuming there is a systematic ability to do it and available R Fare, one would need a friendly check-in agent, or gate agent.

This idea goes as follows:

T-2h: Find the Friendly Gate agent to see if you can SDC, then SDC back to the flight you wanted, but in a Y/B Fare (Due to fare classes leveling out, there is no additional fee)
Check Upgrade Options with Gate agent, to see if they still show the MilagePlus option, but showing only miles needed.

I understand rules are rules and everything, so if this doesn't work then back to just paying the co-pay for me, but I wanted to see what you guys thought.

We arrive at night with a hard landing. Not any landing, a near stall. The pilot had the aircraft's nose down, before quickly pulling it up to flare. Pulls the nose up high, stalls a bit and slams on the ground. Oh, you had to pay for food too. 

4 days ago we took off on another United flight. LAX to EWR. We were booked on a 757, but that overbooked. We were switched to a 777, where the 757 flight was delayed 10 hours. This time, the flight HAD internet, but here's the catch. You had to pay, but for free we could have private screening which was limited. I never knew we had this until we took off, where we had to download the United app, but you needed internet, which was overpriced and didn't even let you go on Netflix.

Garbage flights. Never flying with United again. Pay for food every flight, no internet or overpriced internet, no entertainment and cramped seats

P.S. we switched to JetBlue when we leave New York.",1514455566.0
Official United.com website offers itineraries in foreign currency which can't actually be purchased?,1,7mji6w,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/7mji6w/official_unitedcom_website_offers_itineraries_in/,0,"I was shopping for a Beijing to DC round trip ticket and only UA and Air China have direct flights here. Google showed a particular price for a particular date of travel and clicking on the google link sent me to United.com which shows the same price, but it is listed in RMB (Yuan), which after conversion does equal to the USD quote from google.

So I try to order the tickets, and it lets me go through the entire process, passenger info, selecting seats, and putting in the payment information at the end, and after all that, when I hit submit order, instead of giving me a confirmation number and email, it somehow sends me to a new search page showing flights from the same dates I requested, but now in US dollars and costing about $500 more.

So instead of going through the google travel link, I opened a new tab, went to united.com, and manually put in the travel dates and airports, and again it brings me to selections offered in RMB and not USD.

What is going on here? Website glitch of some sort? If I try to search the same dates with expedia or Orbitz or something like that, it doesn't offer the same dates or prices, and of course all costs are quoted in USD.

Really confused at the false hope of a really cheap international ticket from UA's own official website.",1514454669.0

I am currently in the market to be added as someone's registered companion for the upcoming year. I had a pass with American, but the employee chose to quit without notifying me whatsoever. I obviously had no recourse. Also, I had a pass with Delta but the employee couldn't re-add me for the upcoming year. This is left me without a pass. It's been so difficult to find as this is a no-no for airline employees. Flying has become a part of my everyday routine. I am looking to get my wings back.

I am an experienced non-rev traveler. I know all the rules to non rev travel and how to conduct myself on your benefits. I'm professional - I dress appropriately, I conduct myself with class, and understand that anything happens it comes back on you and your job. You would not have to worry to have your reputation having me on your pass and know the privacy that is required.

What I would like to know is:

Year you started, preferably looking for a person who worked for the Airline for numerous year to get seniority (N.A. American).

Whether you'd provide direct access to flights booking portal. I know it's not practical to have the holder to book/change tickets.

Let's arrange all the details over phone and e-mails, and prefer to meet you in the city or at any airport over lunch/drinks for the final part - as we suppose you would, too. This is not required, though, depending on how trustworthy would be the information provided.

I'm aware there are many scams related to these, as I've almost been scammed before, so it will be important for both parties to be on the same page. I am definitely going to avoid any requests to send money via Western Union or etc.",1512885969.0

I was fortunate enough this year to be able to travel much more than I have in the past. And I decided next year I am going to pursue silver status. I could never find a straight answer anywhere. 

This year I took 2 trips on United, 2 on Delta, and one on Alaska (however I had a second unexpected leg on Alaska as well). The United segments in question are for the following dates: 8/1/2017 and 8/14/2017 (I traveled 6 legs on United Domestic first and PS Business) earning roughly 10k PQM and 1100 PQD. I found out United probably is the best airline to suit where I am going in the future so I feel going for status with them is best.

I need roughly 2000 PQD and will have enough miles for status if they count from this year.

QUESTION: 
I have a rather long trip and I plan to pay up for Business the entire trip going from PDX to BKK in (May and June). And returning. Will my previous PQM/PQD count? From 8/1/2017 and 8/14/2017?

Problems with United.com booking and bookings over the phone,5,700is8,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/700is8/problems_with_unitedcom_booking_and_bookings_over/,1,"Typically, I'm a die-hard United flyer. They have been my airline of choice for business and pleasure for many years, and I have a tone of miles racked up. I'm very upset with my most recent attempt booking a flight through the United website. So upset that I'm actually posting something.  

I've been trying to book a round trip flight from LAX to ADL from 9/20 to 9/27 (operated by Quantas), and I've had nothing but problems and price increases over 2 hours. Booking a flight normally takes me 5 minutes, and I've never had any issues until today. The specific flight I tried to book online was quoted at $1220 + tax. Once I clicked on the ""pay"" button, I received an error, and the website told me to call United. I tried to book the flight 2-3 more times online, but I received the same error each time. I finally called United to book the flight over the phone. I reached a human relatively quickly and gave the operator the flight details. Then I was placed on hold while he tried to confirm the flight details. I was on hold for nearly 1 hour, which is absurd to book a flight. It shouldn't be this difficult for me to give money to a company, right? Then I heard the line connect from the hold music to the background chatter in the call center, and I was disconnected.  

I tried to book the flight online again. No luck, same error. I reluctantly called United again and reached another human relatively quickly. I gave this operator all of the same flight details, and she told me the flight was going to cost $7000. Seriously, wtf? Oh, yea, it was a mistake. I had to repeat the flight information 3 times to the operator before she finally got it right. Now the price she quoted me was $1550 + tax. I know it's not the call center people's fault when this stuff happens, so even though I'm infuriated on the inside, I make a conscious effort not to be mean. I nicely let her know that I was trying to book this flight for quite a while, and that the website kept giving me errors. I asked for the originally quoted price or a rebate for future flights, but she said that she couldn't do anything. Then I asked to speak to a supervisor. Shockingly, she said there was no supervisor. Really? This lady is sitting alone in a call center with no supervisor? WTF. I find this utterly unbelievable.

My flight was cancelled from EWR to Miami...,1,6ykfex,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/6ykfex/my_flight_was_cancelled_from_ewr_to_miami/,1,"...and I had to be in Miami by 1 pm the following day. I had already checked my bags and when United couldn't find me another flight I was forced to drive to Connecticut to take a Jet Blue flight to West Palm Beach early the next morning. When I tried to retrieve my bags they told me it would take 2-3 hours to locate my bag. Moments later I was told that it would be on the next flight to Miami. So I go home to get a few hours of sleep before I make the trek to Connecticut. When I get home I call to make sure that my returning was still booked and to make sure my bags were indeed on the next flight to Miami. The rep on the phone told me that she couldn't find any record of my bags scheduled for that flight. So I go back to Newark airport and they tell me they don't know if my bags are on the next flight (last flight of the night) to Miami and that they'd only know once it took off because that's when their baggage system updates. I waited at the airport until 1 am because this flight was delayed due to ""operational delays"". At 12:45 am the system magically updated and the rep at the airport told me my bags were scheduled to be on that flight (before it took off, contradicting what they told me earlier about the system updating). So I leave EWR and start the trip to Bradley Airport in Connecticut and on the way there the flight that my bags were supposedly on landed in Miami. I called united again and my bags were still in NJ. I expressed to them that my bags needed to be on the first flight to Miami (7:00 am) because I was going on a cruise that afternoon. They said okay no problem those bags will be on the 7:00 am flight. Turns out when that flight landed it didn't have my bag and it was still sitting in NJ! They told me I would have $500 to spend that I'd be reimbursed for. Now that I'm back from vacation and trying to get my money back I am getting the runaround every time I call and the website isn't working when I try to attach my receipts. On top of this I was never refunded my money for the cancelled flight. Any suggestions on how to proceed? Thanks so much. 

TLDR: My flight was cancelled and they said I could spend $500 that I'd be reimbursed for. The website isn't working and when I call they just tell me to use the website. How do I get my $500 back and refunded for my flight?

To get an idea of what I mean, read the new United Basic Economy Fare posted below:

- 1 personal item only, no access to overhead bin.
- Seats assigned after check-in.
- No upgrades.
- Changes and refunds are not permitted.
- Board in last group.

Does that not scream ""inconvenience"" to you? You can't get a refund, no upgrades for you peasants, oh and you board last. Sheesh, I'm so sorry I'm spending a fortune to fly with you guys... 

With the prices of flights already high, it's shocking to see such limitations put in place. If the prices were half the price I would have no problem with it at all, but Basic Economy Fare seats are essentially about $50 less than their upgraded seats; not worth the crap treatment. 

I know what some of you may say, ""No one is forcing you to fly with them,"" and you're damn right! Which is why I'll be taking my business elsewhere. I'll spend $100 more on a different airline just to avoid United until the treatment of their customer's changes.

Is this really a ""tax""? I've never flown internationally before but have been flying United a lot.

 Dear Mr. <last name removed>:

I’m sorry to learn your flight from Cincinnati to Chicago was delayed on July 10, 2017. We understand your time is valuable and wish we could’ve gotten you and your family to your destination sooner. Especially when traveling with children.

Our goal is to operate every flight on schedule, every day.  Unfortunately, there are times when unforeseen events may cause a flight to be delayed and/or canceled.  Our records indicate your flight was delayed due to Air Traffic Control/Flow Control. This program is not within United’s control and is usually instituted for conditions that require increased spacing between aircraft due to inclement weather, increased traffic at an airport or in route to another airport in the same line of flight, closed runways, etc.

While compensation /reimbursement is not typically offered for flight interruptions resulting from circumstances beyond our control, as a gesture of goodwill and token of our concern for your experience, I’ve requested an Electronic Travel Certificate be sent to each of you via separate email. You will receive them in the next few days.

On behalf of United I want to thank you for being a valued MileagePlus member. We appreciate your business and understanding and look forward to the continued privilege of serving your future travel needs.

 

Regards,

Mireya Meza

Hello Mireya,

I don't think that you fully understand or appreciate what we endured due to United's lack of ability to get us to our destination as we had scheduled and paid for. We were traveling with our children; ages 10, 7 and 4. Not only did an 8 hour day trip back home turn into a day and a half, but we incurred additional expenditures that were unplanned and had to take extra time off of work that was also not planned. We were originally scheduled to fly from Cincinnati to Chicago and then to our destination of Spokane. By the time that your airline was able to get us to Chicago we had missed our scheduled flight to Spokane. I had called Customer Service early that day and was given the assurance by the representative that we would make it into Chicago on-time via our rescheduled flight. As it turned out, that flight was delayed and then delayed again and eventually cancelled and we were placed back onto our original flight to Chicago. Had we been given the option, we could have easily driven to Chicago from Cincinnati in the time that we wasted trying to fly out. You say that the circumstances were beyond your control, but the plane leaving Chicago certainly didn't have any problems flying out as it left on-time. As if all of that isn't bad enough, by the time that we got to Chicago it was about 9:30pm or 10pm if I remember correctly. I waited in line at United's Customer Service desk at the airport so that I could find out what our options were from that point. Getting through that line took about 45 minutes. The agent at the desk informed me that no other flights were heading to Spokane so we would have to wait until the following day to get home. Unfortunately for us that also meant adding yet another stop along the way in San Francisco. I was only offered a discount hotel voucher which also turned out to be absolutely worthless. After making several attempts at booking a discounted room only to find out that they were all booked it was approaching 11:30pm. So now our kids were not only worn out from travel as it was, but hungry since all of the restaurants had closed and it was looking like we would not have a place to sleep. We finally found a Holiday Inn that had room for us and we were elated. Yet another roadblock though. It was too late for them to send a shuttle apparently. We we explored the option of a taxi, but it would be a 35-40 minute ride each way and we would have to take 2 taxis since there were 5 of us and all of our luggage. Can you imagine how much that would have cost by the time that the round trip was calculated? This left us with only one option and that was the Hilton at the airport. That room was just under $500 after taxes and fees and the room itself was tiny and only had 2 small beds, but that is all that we could afford and we really couldn't afford that. Since it was now after midnight, we made due. By this point we were all starving, but rather than spending more money that we couldn't afford on room service we got by on the few snacks that we had. Morning came and we had no choice but to eat in the hotel's bistro. As you probably saw from the receipt, that was almost $40 for 2 breakfast sandwiches, 3 chocolate milks and a coffee. That is hardly enough for a family of 5. We found our way back into the main terminal and checked in through security and then headed towards our gate. The options in the terminal were limited and expensive, but we found the best deals that we were able to and once again spent money that we couldn't afford to spend, but we needed to eat. We kept our hopes up and fingers crossed and our plane left for San Francisco on-time so we would at least be one step closer to finally getting home. Our time in San Francisco was quick and that flight left on-time as well. We got back into Spokane at about 9:30pm or maybe 9:45pm so that cost us an additional day of parking fees on top of everything else. My shift starts at 5:30am so there was no way that I would be able to make it in at that time safely after 2 full days of travel and barely any sleep so I had to miss work that following day.

I am truly surprised and insulted at the lack of service that we received on this trip. We spent $2400 to fly United instead of another airline and that ended up costing us almost $800 in additional charges and an extra day off of work due to the lack of ability for your airline to hold up its end of the agreement. Then you come back with an offer of restrictive $150 vouchers? What exactly is that supposed to cover for our situation? Additionally, anywhere that we would possibly fly would be $400-$500 + tax for each ticket. Not to mention that if that trip were to end up anything like this trip did we would need to plan ahead for spending an additional $1000 in unplanned expenditures. I sincerely hope that your airline can and will do better than what you have offered for the time, trouble and stress that we endured by choosing to fly United.

I have no idea, do I somehow add the bag later? If yes, how do they charge me? Or do I simply walk to the check in counter, drop it off there and pay the $25? It's my first time booking a flight inside the US.. I'm from Europe and you usually choose and pay a checked bag when you book your flight - if you end up doing that in any way later you almost always pay huge fees.

My father is flying to Israel from Michigan to celebrate his mother's 80th birthday. He has received nothing but disrespect from United employees so far.

He arrived at the airport in Michigan over two hours early for the flight, only for the flight to be delayed over two hours, with no reason given by United. When my father asked a United agent about the delay, and about the possibility of missing his connection, the employee was sarcastic, and just plain disrespectful, acting as if it were no big deal should he miss his flight, even though the next flight was over 24 hours later.

He had a connecting flight in New Jersey, which he nearly missed. The first flight arrived so late that he literally had to *SPRINT* across the terminal to his gate. He was not even checked in security due to the flight being so late. The door was held for him, thankfully, but that only led to the in-flight crew being extremely rude to him. 

He, having been forced to run at maximum-pace across the airport, was fatigued, sweaty, and extremely thirsty. He simply asked the flight-attendant for a water. A cup of water, a bottle of water, anything, and was promptly presented with snooty remarks about being the reason the flight had to be held for a few minutes, and denied, stating ""water cannot be served until the flight is in the air."" So now he sits on the packed plane, feeling as if ""he is dying"", and denied any assistance from the flight crew. The flight has not yet even taken off yet, so I cannot speak for any more issues that will surely arise as the short trip goes on.

I'm going on a family trip to Ireland and will be meeting family in Dublin. I'll be traveling from Texas to Dublin with my Grandfather, and I'm looking to get him closer to the front of the bus.

I currently have the Silver status with United, which I've found does very little in terms of help on upgrades, but is super useful for better security lines, free checked bags, and early boarding (Bright Side!).

My grandfather doesn't often travel, so I feel like it would be super cool to get him up into first class (or business depending on the plane). I booked one of our tickets using miles, and purchased the other one outright. 

Do you guys think it'd be best to wait until check-in to see if any cheaper upgrades are available when we get to the airport? If I upgrade now, I'm sure it'll be at least a couple grand, as we're flying direct to London for a connecting flight.

>Customers may carry the following infant and child articles on board, in addition to the maximum carry-on baggage allowance:

>-Diaper bag  
>-Breast pump  
>-Government-approved child seat (infant carrying seat or car seat)

>**Strollers and car seats**

>United accepts one stroller and one car seat free of charge for each child, including children under the age of two traveling on an adult's lap and infants traveling internationally on 10 percent of an adult fare.

>If requested by the customer, United can check strollers at the departure gate. United is not liable for damage to strollers. Customers cannot purchase excess valuation for strollers.

>**Government-approved child seat**  
>...  
> If space is not available after boarding is completed, the item [car seat] must be stowed in an approved storage space.  

Here's what I am assuming will be allowed, based on that. Will you please correct me if I am incorrect?

***Mom*** - a small carry-on suitcase, personal item (probably her purse), and a $25 checked bag  
***Dad*** - a small carry-on suitcase, personal item (my backpack), and a $25 checked bag  
***Baby*** - stroller (checked at the gate), car seat (stowed somewhere on the plane?), diaper bag (carried by Mom or Dad), AND a carry-on suitcase


--------------------------
**Post-vacation Update** - Our interpretation of the language on the website was correct. They were very good about helping us with gate-checking BOTH the stroller and the carseat (and our stroller is kind of a big one, a jogging stroller) - and the stroller/carseat were ready for us both times we got off the plane so we could load up the baby and stroll right off the bridge into the airport. 

All in all, we ended up checking those two items at the gate, baby had a carry-on for all of her clothes for the week, and we also carried on our own stuff plus a diaper bag.

This was all for an international flight - ORD--->CUN .... baby did not have a seat, just paid the 10% adult fare and was a lap-sitter.

Flying as a large group w/ Miles,2,6hde9o,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/6hde9o/flying_as_a_large_group_w_miles/,1,"My Dad is a mileageplus points hoarder, so when our family needed to travel abroad for an event he insisted on booking us all with his miles. I've been traveling on my own for over a decade now, with my own preferred airlines, and haven't ever flown with a group this big, so I have a few questions on how this all works. I tried searching online but couldn't find anything. Thanks in advance!

1) None of the confirmations he sent me had seat assignments, and the flights all look super-full except the odd middle seat here and there (sigh). Does this mean we're likely just given what's left when we check in? And if we complain they'll just try to shuffle around (or more likely just tell us to pound sand or pay to upgrade)? 

2) Am I able to check in without the rest of the group if I have our e-ticket #s? My parents have us flying out of their home airport, but we live about an hour and a half away so will be travelling there separately, and they're always late, so I'd rather avoid waiting on them if I can.

Seeking advice about poor customer service,6,6ager4,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/6ager4/seeking_advice_about_poor_customer_service/,9,"Hi all,

I'd like your input on how I should deal with a customer service issue.

I was on a trans-Pacific flight recently (right after Dr. Dao's aisle-dragging incident). I wanted to be able to stretch out some so I upgraded to Economy Plus for $215. The seat recline button was broken and my window seat was unable to recline. I told a flight attendant about it and her response was, ""Well that sucks."" She offered to seat me between two other people and I said that I didn't pay for a middle seat. Her response was a curt ""No, you paid for ***a*** seat"" (she added emphasis on ""a""). 

Her response made me feel condescended to and unvalued as a customer so I contacted United through their website and left a complaint with them and also requested a refund for my upgrade. They wrote back a week later to offer me a $100 credit toward future flights and gave the following explanation:

> Each aircraft adheres to a maintenance designed to address these type of
> issues.  Sometimes we are unaware a seat has broken until the next
> person sits there.

They didn't mention anything about the flight attendant. I was still unsatisfied so I repeated my request for a full refund and also asked them to address my experience with the flight attendant. Their response was:

> Our records indicate you sat in EconomyPlus and enjoyed the benefits
> (extra leg room, forward seating, priority boarding, priority exit) of
> EconomyPlus. While we understand your recline feature didn't work,
> please know this is not a benefit of EconomyPlus as most seats recline
> throughout the entire coach cabin. Please keep in mind there are some
> seats that do not recline or have limited recline even in EconomyPlus.
> While we are unable to refund your seat fee, we did our best to make
> things right with the travel certificate we sent.
> 
> We are sorry you were disappointed with our employee's service onboard.
> Thanks for bringing this matter to my attention, as your comments help
> to identify training and focus areas. Your honest feedback helps us meet
> that goal.

I'm still feeling burned about the whole experience, and their response has only worsened that feeling. I feel like this is the type of attitude that led to Dr. Dao getting dragged off the plane. United was unwilling to increase the amount of compensation for the sake of saving a negligible amount of money. The difference between what I asked for and what I received is $115. Can they not shell out a little more to address my experience? If I were working for them, I would have sought authorization to refund me the upgrade fee and then upgrade my next flight for free. 

What really bothers me is the overarching attitude of neglecting passengers in favor of saving a few pennies here and there. They might as well be called a freight business.

Do you have any suggestions? Thanks in advance.",1494487356.0

United's Letter to Customers,2,67xj4x,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/67xj4x/uniteds_letter_to_customers/,15,"Dear Miss Ariel,

Each flight you take with us represents an important promise we make to you, our customer. It's not simply that we make sure you reach your destination safely and on time, but also that you will be treated with the highest level of service and the deepest sense of dignity and respect.

Earlier this month, we broke that trust when a passenger was forcibly removed from one of our planes. We can never say we are sorry enough for what occurred, but we also know meaningful actions will speak louder than words.

For the past several weeks, we have been urgently working to answer two questions: How did this happen, and how can we do our best to ensure this never happens again?

It happened because our corporate policies were placed ahead of our shared values. Our procedures got in the way of our employees doing what they know is right.

Fixing that problem starts now with changing how we fly, serve and respect our customers. This is a turning point for all of us here at United – and as CEO, it's my responsibility to make sure that we learn from this experience and redouble our efforts to put our customers at the center of everything we do.

That’s why we announced that we will no longer ask law enforcement to remove customers from a flight and customers will not be required to give up their seat once on board – except in matters of safety or security.

We also know that despite our best efforts, when things don’t go the way they should, we need to be there for you to make things right. There are several new ways we’re going to do just that.

We will increase incentives for voluntary rebooking up to $10,000 and will be eliminating the red tape on permanently lost bags with a new ""no-questions-asked"" $1,500 reimbursement policy. We will also be rolling out a new app for our employees that will enable them to provide on-the-spot goodwill gestures in the form of miles, travel credit and other amenities when your experience with us misses the mark. You can learn more about these commitments and many other changes at hub.united.com.

While these actions are important, I have found myself reflecting more broadly on the role we play and the responsibilities we have to you and the communities we serve.

I believe we must go further in redefining what United's corporate citizenship looks like in our society. You can and ought to expect more from us, and we intend to live up to those higher expectations in the way we embody social responsibility and civic leadership everywhere we operate. I hope you will see that pledge express itself in our actions going forward, of which these initial, though important, changes are merely a first step.

Our goal should be nothing less than to make you truly proud to say, ""I fly United.""

Ultimately, the measure of our success is your satisfaction and the past several weeks have moved us to go further than ever before in elevating your experience with us. I know our 87,000 employees have taken this message to heart, and they are as energized as ever to fulfill our promise to serve you better with each flight and earn the trust you’ve given us.

We are working harder than ever for the privilege to serve you and I know we will be stronger, better and the customer-focused airline you expect and deserve.

With Great Gratitude,
Oscar Munoz

Why the frustrating upgrade delay,1,67quwq,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/67quwq/why_the_frustrating_upgrade_delay/,1,"Flying to CDG in late May ... currently about 17 empty Polaris seats on my flight (and the rest of the cabin is only about half full too).  Put in for a miles-based upgrade when I purchased tix in February, but still am awaiting the upgrade.  

Yesterday I checked the same flight a week out, and then tomorrow (now today) - in each case, anywhere from 5 to 15 empty Polaris seats.  

My thing is, if United (and its computer algorithms) *know* that some Polaris seats are going to go unsold, no matter what, why not confirm upgrades now?  Maybe this is a little whiney, but - it'd be really nice (and god knows United could need positive passenger experiences) to find out about the upgrade a couple weeks in advance ... sure if I'm finally awarded the upgrade at the gate, it'll be nice and I'll take it; but it just seems stupid to drag out the process (which they're obviously doing daily, given the number of empty Polaris seats on every flight to CDG in the next month).",1493267638.0

Then they say there's a mechanical difficulty and have the entire plane load march to the other side of Newark. After being on the other side for not more than 5 minutes some people start getting text messages that their flight is at the first gate, so half the plane leaves. Then they finally get around to telling the other half that the first plane is fixed and have the rest of us march back to the first gate as well.

Back at the first gate the boarding time keeps getting pushed back incrementally but we finally get on the first plane. While on the taxiway they decide it's not actually fixed and turn us around to go back to the gate. They tell us there's a second plane that's ""ready"" and this plane is gonna pull up the to the gate next door so we can take it. The flight was supposed to leave at 7:30pm and it's now like 10:30 or 11, they set the new boarding time for 1:30am!

We wait, 1:30am comes and we dont board. For the next two hours they keep pushing the departure time back by 15 minutes every time we hit the old departure time without boarding. No explanation about what's going on. They finally tell us they've been waiting on the caterer (and why? You think we didn't all just eat dinner when you told us at 11 that it would be 3 hours before we left!?!?!).  Around 3:30 we finally get on the second plane and taxi off.

While on the taxiway they decide this plane isn't right either, we go back to the gate. We have to sit in front of the gate for a while because the people who tow you *into* the gate went home. Once we get into the gate we just sit there for an hour or so while they fix the plane. They fix it, we taxi out, and we finally take off. Takeoff was a 5:20am, basically 10 hours late.

When we got to the destination the pilot apoligized for the delays and then literally said ""we've got nothing to offer you for that"". That isn't technically true, btw, they had us go to a website which offered up a poorly formatted text apology and a 200 dollar gift certificate for future travel with United.

United Strikes Again,8,66cle4,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/66cle4/united_strikes_again/,2,"Never really had an issue with United until now despite all the negative press. We booked our honeymoon trip earlier this year and everything went great. Family emergency came up a little over a month ago and we had to cancel our entire trip. Our plans had once again changed and we tried to rebook everything again.

The original flight we booked was from NRT - CTS, 2 tickets full fare through United Airlines website with partner airline ANA. We cancelled it and the fare was sitting in our United account attached to the cancelled reservation. When attempting to change the reservation and utilize the credit towards rebooking it gave an error and said to call. I called and the first person couldn't do anything, the supervisor couldn't do anything and said to submit a refund form and also couldn't confirm if we would even get our refund on a full fare ticket that they wouldn't even let us rebook.

I was not trying to give them a hard time or be one of ""those"" customers but something that didn't have to be difficult, became another incident that punishes a customer for following the rules. I didn't even ask for a refund the entire time because all we wanted was to rebook our honeymoon flight. 

Supervisor ""Maggie"" could care less about us as a loyal united customer and the one trip that meant the most to us. 

tldr: Booked a full fare flight through united for a partner airline, cancelled due to family emergency, plans changed and tried to rebook, website wouldn't let us use the credit, supervisor wouldn't allow it or confirm that we could get a refund on our full fare tickets. ",1492659843.0

Pretty much every other flight something goes wrong, and the poor United employees I’ve had to interact with seem to have developed a real disdain for their company and unfortunately the self-loading cargo (aka passengers).

Eight hour delay in LAX due to mechanical issues? $10 voucher, take it or leave it! Computer screwed up and moved you to an aisle seat in the back? Better shut up and get on the plane now or we’ll blame you for delaying boarding! Not enough room for your carryon since we pack most planes to full capacity and charge extra for flyers doing the right thing and checking their bags? Better get used to putting that bag where your legs are supposed to go.

I had such a bad experience last time I flied two 5-hr flights that I wrote them an email. The thing that really broke me was that I twice got re-assigned to the non-reclining seats in front of the emergency row which I didn’t find out until boarding, and when I told them this was really uncomfortable they told me not to worry, that it would recline, and to stop holding up the line. I actually got a callback from United, where I had a nice conversation with a frustrated agent, who in the end told me that “United is just following industry trends”. It is apparent where those trends are heading.

It is doubtful United or the other airlines will learn to place long term customer confidence and goodwill ahead of short term profit. Hopefully Congress or other regulators will learn that they are the only way that thing will get better in this non-competitive broken “free-market” airline system, where your only options are to take it or leave it.

I am with United on doctor kerfluffle...,0,6554yk,unitedairlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedairlines/comments/6554yk/i_am_with_united_on_doctor_kerfluffle/,37,"I have a different take on the United kerfluffle. When I first heard of the incident. I thought of all the times I had an appointment at 1PM and not seen until 4PM... Emergencies happen. And they seem to happen a lot at the doctors office. So many doctors - especially GP's and my cardiologist - are guilty of overbooking just like the airlines. I saw it as some kind of karmic payback for those hours in the waiting room looking around and wondering if any of my fellow patients had any lethal contagious diseases.

Yes, I was guilty of a bit of schadenfreunde (joy in the misery of others).  

Airlines have emergencies too. There are very rigid FAA rules about how long a flight crew can fly. If a crew is held up in a flight pattern over say Kansas City, They might not be able to complete the last leg of their flight without exceeding their allotted hours. A new flight crew must be there to take over. If there is not one there, they must fly one in - ""on the fly"" so to speak.

They have procedures listed in the fine print on the ticket. They offered the required payment for the ticket, payment for any accommodations. Plus they kicked in an extra $800.  Seems fair to me. My doctor has never offered squat for my 3 hours in the waiting room.

When they could not get the necessary seats, they had a random drawing and the ""doctor"" lost. There were nobility points given to the ""doctor"" for simply being a ""doctor"" and for being so dedicated - wanting  get back to his patients. We found out he was a ""doctor"" who had lost his license because he traded oxycontin to patients for sex. I took away is nobility points. He was just a guy wanting to get home.

The random selection seems fair. He was escorted off the plane; then he got back on. The officers asked that he leave again. He refused. They explained to him exactly what would happen. He refused to comply. They were completely in compliance of FAA regulations and the fine print on the back of his ticket, when they dragged him off the plane.

He did all he could to maximize the drama. The injuries he suffered are on him. And the laws concerning flight times for crew members are on the FAA. I am with United on this one.",1492115173.0
