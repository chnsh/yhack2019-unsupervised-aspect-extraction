"""asked to move because we have a child""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to New Orleans. I love Southwest, but I’m very disappointed in one of the flight attendants, MCO-MSY at 11:10 on 10/24. She asked us to make sure our toddler didn’t play with the tray because the people in front of us could feel it. I said okay I’m sorry we will try our best, but he is 18 months and doesn’t quite understand. She then suggested that we move by the other people with kids. Southwest is open seating so I don’t appreciate being asked to move because we have a child. If there were certain rules to where families have to sit somewhere specific then Southwest should put that in place. Otherwise, everyone should be allowed to sit where they please - with children or without."
"""I’m without a complaint""","✅ Trip Verified | Alex, our flight attendant on our flight from Orlando to Las Vegas on October 19th on flight 3982 was awesome! I’ve never enjoyed a flight so much! He was funny, took his job seriously, and was so attentive to bat. Southwest is lucky to have him and such a wonderful team onboard their planes. The trip was smooth, fun, and I’m without a complaint."
"""take so long to get bags""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Washington. Why does it take so long to get bags? I could have flown another carrier. But still this is ridiculous 30 min. SWA you out here showing LUV, show some here at Washington Regan."
"""Would not recommend this airline""","Not Verified | Dallas to New Orleans. I had 3 flights get canceled so I had to stay in the airport all night - waiting here for 14 hours. I asked Southwest staff for maybe a blanket or pillow and they were extremely rude. Would not recommend this airline, definitely not reliable."
"""I am told to leave the plane""","Not Verified | Baltimore to Pittsburgh. As I boarded this SW flight, and was attempting to get a seat, utilizing Southwest’s ‘open seating’ policy, the attendant blocked me from getting to a seat, stating he was holding the seats for others. Because I asked him repeatedly about the Southwest policy that he was not adhering to, he got loud stating that I need to find another seat. I did and apparently I needed to have a ‘cheery’ disposition, because before I knew it, another attendant was in my face telling me I need to listen to the attendants. I was already in a seat and was lost as to what she was talking about, sure enough another employee who was not even with the crew, comes on board and is now demanding that I verbally answer him, when he tells me I need to listen to the attendants (and no I was not in the emergency exit, nor was I doing any duties for the airline). So yes we are back in kindergarten and I answered him, but that too was not good enough, because he provides his rendition to the captain and I was told to leave the plane. I was not loud, nor drunk, nor physically abusive, I did not raise my voice, nor did I cause a commotion. And now I am told to leave the plane because 1 person, decided to take his frustration out on me. I did nothing wrong to anyone on that plane, nothing wrong to anyone in the airport and Southwest can justify people making decisions like this. If you are frustrated with your job before 9:00am then why does Southwest have morning flights? Clearly the employees do not want to deal with customers during certain hours. And what is even more disheartening, is the fact that they are allowed to document lies and nonsense to cover their end and nowhere is it documented what I went through as a paying customer. I guarantee I would not recommend Southwest to anyone ever."
"""checked bags had its handle broken""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Orlando. I bought Southwest Airlines flight to Orlando thinking it was good as it used to be. I am traveling with a family due to which I carried 4 checked in bags. One of the checked bags had its handle broken, another bag came with a huge dent. Not sure if Southwest Airlines employees were all playing catch or basketball with my bags. By the way at the express check in they expect you to put the claims tags on the bags by yourself. I have never worked for an airline, due to which I tried my best to make sure that the claims label goes on each bag. The lady at Baltimore check in asked me 3-4 times as to why I did not put the labels in a certain way for them to read the label (it was not even bent). I had to tell her that I did this for the first time each time. She wouldn’t stop. Southwest Airlines you better have people at the kiosk to put those claims labels in a professional way. Just because you are giving us free checked in bags, doesn’t mean that you can do all these damages and don’t even care about that."
"""Southwest used to be the best""","Not Verified | This is the umpteenth time our flight has been delayed a ridiculous amount. Today it is delayed now 3 hours which puts us at our connection at the time it should leave, most likely without us. Southwest used to be the best, easiest, and most convenient and all of that seems to have ended. I choose Southwest for many years now because I’ve always enjoyed the company more than others. Now it’s smartest to go with the most affordable, since the only things that make Southwest stand out anymore are negative. The free bags used to be nice, now it’s cheaper to pay someone to check them. The family boarding used to be nice, now they just let anyone with a minor on at that time, even if the “child” is actually of adult ability. The price used to be nice, now many other airlines are less expensive. The staff used to be nice, now they’re nowhere to be found. Not even one staff member manning the two gates I’m siting at."
"""Southwest charged me an additional 400$""","✅ Trip Verified | I scheduled a flight in May for my September trip. Originally from Orlando. Hurricane was bearing down on Florida and Orlando airport was due to close because of the storm. My tickets were bought and paid for in May. 400$ round trip for 2. At the very last minute before the airport closed I switched my flight to Tampa so I wouldn't miss my trip. Southwest charged me an additional 400$ for the same distance flight that they cancelled 4 hours later when they closed the Orlando airport. Been a Southwest customer for many many years. I will be looking at my options and do what it takes to never use Southwest again."
"""cannot guarantee you will sit with your children""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to El Paso with Southwest Airlines. If you fly with children, expect to be separated and to have your children fly next to adult strangers. They cannot guarantee you will sit with your children, although they try to sell you upgraded boarding. The upgrade also does not guarantee your seating with your family. It's disgusting and reprehensible. Karma is what happened to them with the MAX. Worth it to pay more with another airline and guarantee your seat."
"""couldn’t use the plane anymore""","Not Verified | Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. We boarded the plane only for the pilot to tell us that we couldn’t use the plane anymore because of the window compressor being frozen or some sort. However, this was an inconvenience for me because I’m flying into Fort Lauderdale and now I’m going to be on the road extra late now do to the flight being delayed for an hour."
"""Friendly without a false feeling""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Atlanta. The personnel on the flight is what really made this a great flight. I have never run into a better flight crew. Friendly without a false feeling. On the lookout for problems and a way to help. Paired with the reasonable cost of airfare made this a pleasant flight."
"""New seating is terrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Columbus to Fort Myers. New seating is terrible, I will never fly Southwest Airlines again. Plane was cramped. I could not even sit with my wife on our way to honeymoon. I would not recommend."
"""it was a pretty smooth flight""","Not Verified | I flew from Houston to Columbus in August, and it was a pretty smooth flight. The cabin crew were very nice, so was everyone there. I would reccomend Southwest Airlines."
"""I'm very angry""","✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Denver. Normally I like Southwest, but they sometimes force you to put both carry ons under your seat if neither is a roller bag. This is horrible. I have a bad knee and am not taking up unreasonable space in the overhead with a laptop bag and have a purse with things I need in the seat, and then save room to stretch out to avoid pain. They allow free checked bags and to punish me for not bringing on a huge roller is ridiculous - others can check or gate check a bag! I'm very angry. Maybe I should buy a roller just for my laptop so I don't have a back pack under my seat in addition to my purse."
"""Very unprofessional""","Not Verified | Las Vegas to Columbus. The Male flight attendant had a favorite row. He spent half the flight standing and talking to them. By the time we got out drinks our ""snacks"" (fritos and baby cookies) were gone because he was so busy playing favorites. Very unprofessional when I spent over 1000 dollars flying with you guys this trip. Never again."
"""less than one star""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Charleston. I would give less than one star if I could. When paying to fly you expect to sit by your spouse not several rows behind. Maybe they should think about updating the seating arrangements"
"""lack of communication""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Boston. I pride myself on packing a carry on bag whenever possible, as opposed to checking a bag. I find it infuriating the lack of communication between the flight crew and the gate attendant checking tickets. Overhead bin storage for carry on luggage was cut off towards the end of the “B” group. For those who do not understand who SW operates, you are not assigned a seat. Based on when you check-in, you are either in Group A, B or C (#1-60). My fiancé and I were B45 and B46 and around B35 an announcement was made that no more carry on bags allowed because overhead bin space was full. No big deal, right? Well when you walk down the aisle and see five bins completely open, I was inspired to write this review. (That doesn’t include the bins that were partially full). See below for just a few photos."
"""They have never let us down""","Not Verified | Reno to Phoenix via Las Vegas returning PHX-RNO, Outbound both flights were spot on with departure. Ground staff great in Reno. We were a pound or two over on our luggage, but no problem. All check-in staff very friendly. Even TSA was accommodating when I forgot to remove my IPad from my backpack and had to get rescanned. Reno airport is always great. Flight left on time. Typical snack/beverage service, with a smile from attendants. Onward flight all the same out of Vegas to Phoenix. Reasonable time for baggage pickup. Then out of the airport. Both flights on a 737-700, reasonable legroom and comfort. Return from PHX-RNO on 737-800. Newish plane but seats less comfortable then the 700. Staff still great and seem genuine. Early departure and arrived 20 minutes early. No complaints. Southwest always deliver a great product in and out of Reno. They have never let us down over the years. Also they had free WiFi and movies on the 800 plane. I did not use so can’t comment but saw others using it with no problems."
"""asked to give a round of applause""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Spokane. A flight attendant did something I’ve never seen in more than 40 years of flying. As we were landing, she asked us all to give a round of applause for military on board. Inappropriate. Now lift up the Peace Corps. Teachers. Journalists. All who also do heroic work."
"""Southwest did not provide value""","Not Verified | Indianapolis to New Orleans. I have been a big supporter of Southwest in the past. I would drive the 2 hours instead of using the local airport, because of cost savings and a good flight. I flew in March with no issues, but this September was a different story. My flight to MSY was okay, but the return trip was another story. My flight was cancelled. I did get another flight to a city that was two hours from my destination. I had to drive to the other airport to pick up my car. Southwest lost my luggage and i had to wait several days for it to be delivered to my home. I incurred extra cost to get back to the other airport at such a late hour, and lost money by not getting back home at designated time. I called Southwest to ask about reimbursement for at least my hotel and rental car that was extra, but was told we do not cover those expenses. I have another flight next month, and I decided to just fly from the smaller local airport. My expenses are a bit more, but my time has value as well, and with what happened last time, the flight was not cheaper in the end. Southwest did not provide value and I see no longer to fly with them."
"""100 bucks wasted""","Not Verified | I used to love Southwest because of flight attendants being a pleasure that gave you peanuts. Last two flights to to get from Phoenix to Charleston staff had very poor attitudes to the point of being rude. To supposedly get a better seat we paid $50 for each of us (my wife and I) got a B position. 100 bucks wasted. Hopefully won't ever use them again. I used to write them compliment letters when Herb ran it."
"""never again use your airline""","Not Verified | Earlier this year we took a trip to New York and flew Southwest. On our return flight you cancelled the flight telling everyone there was lightning at LaGuardia and Southwest was not flying. You charged us $320 per ticket for a round trip. We should receive a 50% ($160) refund each for you not honoring your end of the contract. We received $115 each, curious as to what kind of math you used! No assistance of any kind was offered by your companies personal and we were told another flight wouldn't be available until the next day. The worst part is that it cost us an additional $900 to fly home to the wrong airport on Delta that day. We sat in the airport for nearly five hours waiting for our flight watching Southwest planes take off and land. Since this is the way you treat customers we will never again use your airline and urge others to do the same!"
"""absolutely terrible""","Not Verified | Chicago to St. Louis. I flew Southwest and it was absolutely terrible. The crew was rude and grumpy. One kept yelling at me to push my bookbag under the seat and it was as far as it could go because they ran out of overhead carry on storage room so they had to check everyone’s rolling carry-ons as checked bags. It was a mess. I will never fly Southwest again."
"""not use their automated system""","Not Verified | Salt Lake City to Cleveland . I just booked my flight through Southwest then booked a rental car through their same portal after that I booked by hotel. Saved me $53! I thought I had done well for myself. They booked by rental car for an hour and 20 minutes after my landing but my hotel they booked for the next day. Since I continued and confirmed my reservation it is nonrefundable. This is all automated and does not indicate that my check in would be restricted till the next day. I went in again thinking I had just not paid attention and done something wrong. It again tried to do the same thing. After 25 minutes with customer service did nothing but regurgitate the lines they had been taught (to admit to nothing and tell me I should have checked closer). When I told her I was their website trying the same thing again she wanted to hear none of it. I will fly with them in the future but will not use their automated system to book anything else."
"""uneventful pair of flights""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Raleigh to Orlando return this past week on Boeing 737-700 aircraft. The inbound flight arrived 15 minutes early (and had 50 empty seats), while the outbound flight was full and on-time. Had no problems with the ground or plane crew in terms of service, the in-flight phone app entertainment worked fine, and it was an uneventful pair of flights. (Although it took 15-20 minutes for them to start unloading luggage at the claims area when I got back.) Getting TSA PreCheck helps immensely."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Not Verified | Philadelphia to Orlando. Delayed. Two hours. I can’t get home because it is a late flight and there is no ground transportation to my home. No compensation for hotel or travel. I will probably have to Uber for $130. They will not compensate for the shuttle service I cannot make it to because of the delay. The response of their ground crew “sucks for you”. Never again. Oh yes, the flight was delayed to get here also."
"""seats were annoyingly uncomfortable""","✅ Trip Verified | St. Louis to Sacramento via Los Angeles with Southwest Airlines. The seats were annoyingly uncomfortable, but otherwise the flight was smooth. The “Evolve” interior in the 737-700 looks dated compared to the “Heart” interior found on the 737-800 and Max 8. The flight attendants were nice as well."
"""I’ll never ever book a flight again""","Not Verified | First time on Southwest Airlines from Salt Lake to San Diego and I’ll never ever book a flight again. When I travel with my wife I want to sit next to her, not some random strangers. I fly a lot but never will again with this company. Employees were rude and said things slightly offensive during announcements."
"""He was an angel in disguise""","Not Verified | Orlando to Philadelphia. I was trying to get my elderly mother on a Southwest flight to Philadelphia so she would be safe from Hurricane Dorian which was headed towards Central Florida. Regulations did not allow me to help my mother get onto the airplane and into her seat. The Gate attendant was extremely helpful to me as my mother was traveling with her little dog and I was very concerned that she would become confused as she has some dementia and would not be able to find a seat or get into her seat while dealing with her dog and her purse. The Gate attendant made sure that someone assisted my mother onto the airplane and helped her get her dog safely under the seat in front of her. Once all the passengers were on board, he made a point of coming over to me and assuring me that my mother was doing fine on the airplane and that the flight attendants would watch over her on her 2.5 hour flight into Philadelphia. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for his helpfulness that day. He was an angel in disguise and I really appreciate everything he did for my mother and her dog. Many thanks."
"""What a scam!""","✅ Trip Verified | We had to fly from Phoenix to LAX where we had a connecting flight from LAX to London from there. Our Southwest plane was 40 min late and we were running short on being able to make our connection flight in LA. Southwest announced that they were offering early boarding and early exiting for the late flight for $30 per person. We talked to Southwest employee about waiving that fee for us since the plane was late and jeopardized our connection flight. The employee said she couldn’t do that for us because we should have allowed more time for the connection flight. We had 3 hours. It seems that when Southwest is late it uses that to sell their customers early boarding and early exits because they know people with connecting flights are now running late and are forced to purchase these $30 extra tickets. What a scam! I showed up on time and waited for your plane that’s late due to you not being organized enough to get your customers in wheelchairs off the plane in a timely manner. Now you want me to pay extra for you being late? Horrible customer service!"
"""doesn't assign seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Orlando via Nashville. On August 22 flight #2421 was over 20 minutes late arriving in Las Vegas. This caused the flight to leave Las Vegas over 50 minutes late this jeopardizing our connection flight #1296 in Nashville. The flight attendants then said they will hold the plane in Nashville until we arrive there. However, we paid for the early bird check-in because Southwest doesn't assign seats for their passengers. In order for you and your family members to sit together, you have to purchase the early bird check-in which assures you a place in line within the first 60 people. This does not work if your flight is delayed coming in and your connecting flight already boards everyone even the people who didn't pay for the early bird check-in. So you get screwed and lose your place in line which you paid for. So when they boarded us onto flight #1296 and we tell the flight attendant that we paid for the early bird check-in. The flight attendant says well we waited 20 minutes for your flight to get in. How is that the passenger's fault that the flight go in late? So they tell us to sit in the only available seats which are center seats not even in the same row. Also to make matters worse the seats are sandwiched in between 2 larger than normal-sized people. So I had to squeeze between 2 large people and my husband got to sit next to a 350lbs man who was partially in his seat so much so that he had to lay his tray table down to lean on it for the entire flight. Did the flight attendants care? Of course not because they herd people like cattle on these aeroplanes, they don't care if your flight is uncomfortable. The flight lasted 1 hour and 23 minutes to Orlando. When we got home. I called Southwest Customer Service and the only thing they said they can do from their end is to refund us the $12.50 each that we paid for the early bird check-in. They said to call their Customer Relations Department. On 8/30/19 I call Customer Relations and explain to the representative the situation and the terrible experience and she said she can only refund us $50 each in travel vouchers towards another Southwest flight. So this airline company takes your money, gives you a terrible flight experience and only gives you $50 each for your unsatisfactory experience due to their flights not keeping on schedule. I told the representative if Southwest assigned seats in the first place it would not have been a problem because no one would have sat in someone else's seat. We pay for the early bird boarding to get within the first 60 people on a plane so parties can sit together. Looking back in hindsight my husband and I should have walked off the plane and asked to be put on another plane where we would be able to board within the early bird boarding and not lose our place in line. I doubt if I will ever book another trip with Southwest."
"""professional and compassionate""","Not Verified | Columbus to Denver. I had a lot of anxiety about my trip. It was my first time taking my service dog on a plane. Every single staff member I encountered was friendly, professional and compassionate. Both flights and all 3 airports went smoothly. Truly appreciate the experience and will absolutely choose Southwest in the future. Thank you for getting us home safe and sound!"
"""canceled with no notice""","Not Verified | Original flight to Houston for first leg was canceled with no notice or explanation. Total trip was supposed to take 6 hours is now 14 hours. Rerouted to Dallas where most of passengers from Houston were on flight. I believe they cancelled the original flight to Houston to fill low passenger flight to Dallas. In Dallas now and have been shuffled around to multiple gates."
"""be the face of the airline!""","Not Verified | Salt Lake City to Denver. I was checking in and the woman at the counter (Nancy) gave the absolute best customer service I’ve had with any airline! She helped me with my bags and was just overall, a really kind person. She should be the face of the airline!"
"""28 hours to board the next flight""","✅ Trip Verified | On both flights from New York to Los Angeles and the return, Southwest cancelled one leg of the flight leaving me to spend the night in the airport on my own twice now in one month. Today I had to wait a full 28 hours to board the next flight. Never book with Southwest if you are not flying non-stop to your destination. Cancellations and delays are the rule and not the exception. The airline does not provide meal taxi nor hotel vouchers. Delays and cancellations are always magically due to weather even in perfect summer conditions according to the airline. The truth is that the airline does not have enough planes staff and pilots to cover slight delays."
"""flight attendants went over and beyond""","✅ Trip Verified | On this day, our flight was delayed due to storms. I am a copd patient who travels with oxygen. After a long day of traveling, I was running low on battery charge. The flight attendants went over and beyond what I needed to make me feel comfortable. And charged my batteries. The outlets at the airport are far and few that even work. And the outlets are always far from were the wheelchairs are placed. After a 5 hour delay we made it home. Thank you for all your help and assistance. And to all who took time out of their day to help me, thank you."
"""her attitude is the worst""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew Puerto Vallarta to Houston, pilot tried to land twice and was a bad storm, he good decided to come to Austin and get some gas. I am always some stress about airplanes and I have been handling pretty good, when I saw we were over the airport in Houston and had to go up twice I starting very nervous, the Captain explained the situation but was very stressful not your fault. I asked the stewardess if she can give me an alcohol drink and she answer in a bad attitude we cannot do that, I was so stressed. I understand sometimes you can’t but was the mean way she said, she was not nice with anybody please urgent put her in a customer service training; on the back of the airplane the other stewardess were serving sodas and taking care about customers she was only sitting at the time I asked for a drink. You have an excellent employees who always take care about customers and do amazing job but her attitude is the worst I have seen."
"""never had a bad experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Norfolk via Orlando. Yesterday I got on board my flight to ultimately take me to Norfolk. The weather in Chicago was lightning and thundering so the pilot wisely put us back at the gate after finding out that we would not be taking off for sometime. They allowed us to get off of the plane so that we could use regular washrooms. It soon became evident that I was going to miss my connecting flight in Orlando which would ultimately take me to Norfolk. I expressed my concerns with the pilot who suggested that I cancel and re-schedule for today. I went to the desk and got a ticket and will be flying out today. In the meantime I had many questions come up regarding my rewards program and had to call customer service for two different issues. Every single person I got with was perfect at handling their job. I cannot give a high enough rating for this airline. I have never had a bad experience traveling on Southwest."
"""kept changing the time""","✅ Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Atlanta. My family and I were taking a vacation to St. Pete’s beach in Florida. Our flight from Milwaukee to Tampa Bay was at 6. We wanted to fly into Tampa and take a cab to the hotel where we would be staying. We could not fly directly to Tampa Bay so we had landed in Atlanta. Now that would’ve been fine if our two hour overlay didn’t turn into a 10 hour stay at the airport. We missed the first day at our hotel which we paid for. We had to sleep at the airport. And we could not meet the rest of our family who was meeting us down there. They flew on Delta. There was a storm in Tampa Bay at the time yet every single airline except Southwest was flying there. Delta and United were still flying to Tampa Bay. I am sad to say this is not the first time I have had an experience like this. At our 10 hour wait at the airport, the airline kept changing the estimation time from waiting to hours to adding an extra 8."
"""waste if you don’t have beverages""","Not Verified | Dallas to Denver. The staff taking drinks to people was nice, but I watched him talk to co-workers while people are looking around at least twice. $300 each way so $600 is a waste if you don’t have beverages."
"""they could have shown empathy""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Milwaukee via Atlanta. Arriving to the airport from a business trip to be notified the flight was an hour delayed. Frustrating but understandable. Things can happen. A little over a hour later, received a text that the flight was canceled. Although it does text you new flights available, the process makes you pay for the new flight, so I didn’t process but went to the counter at the gate. There were over 50 people in a line dealing with the same situation. There were two ladies working the counter (there were additional stations open that more employees could have been deployed to move the line faster). I was in this line for 1 1/2 hours. Once it was my turn, no greeting from the employee, no apology and only one option was given for a new flight which was the following day with a layover making my direct flight into a much longer trip. I asked if Southwest was offering any compensation to their customers for hotel accommodations and the answer was “the weather in Milwaukee was going to get really bad and by the time the flight would get there, the airport would be closed, so no, they don’t compensate for weather”. That statement was false. I live in Milwaukee and no rain or storms were in the forecast. I left the counter not feeling valued as a customer. In customer service, how you handle a difficult situation is where you gain loyalty. Not one of those 50 customers walked away feeling valued or that anyone was doing all they could to help. I understand a regional airline like Southwest doesn’t have as many flights as the other airlines to try and help people, but they could have shown empathy, be apologetic, offered some type of compensation even if it was a voucher for their airline. But we were all just a number in a line. I will suggest to my company and to my husband’s company to think about this before booking their next flights."
"""simple easy and on time""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Oakland. Always a pleasure simple easy and on time. No problems no questions. Simple and clear pricing. Why is united so all over the place? Always trying to make you feel like a class."
"""get extra cleaners to come around""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Austin. I understand flight attendants have very minimal time to check through the plane before the next flight of people is being shoved on but I think after this flight that really needs to change. My 18 month old loves to pull out the magazine and info cards in the seat pockets and on this flight they were absolutely disgusting. One was sticky with who knows what, one pocket had so much trash fall on our stuff it was hard to tell how the magazine and info stuff fit, then there was a coloring book left right on the aisle seat that they easily could've picked up. Again I understand there's not a lot of time, but that should maybe be adjusted or get extra cleaners to come around, I don't know but it was a gross way to start the journey home."
"""disappointed in the service""","Not Verified | Really disappointed in the service I received. I have TSA precheck but it notoriously does not show up on my boarding pass when I check in through the app. I saw an attendant when I arrived at the airport and was told there was nothing they could do to make the TSA precheck show up on my boarding pass. I’ve been flying for 2 years with TSA precheck and have never had this issue with any other airline. Very frustrating for a frequent flyer."
"""not be using Southwest again""","✅ Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to San Diego via Chicago. Crew is rude, non caring. Probably the worst flight experience that I have had. Cabin of plane smells of mold/mildew. The boarding process is the worst. I will fly any other airline, but will not be using Southwest again due to how much i paid to be treated so rudely."
"""Most uncomfortable plane""","Not Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta via Las Vegas. Most uncomfortable plane in existence. Plane appeared to be newer but the seats were so uncomfortable that my back took 4 days to correct itself. Could hardly move after a nice relaxing vacation. Put a huge damper on my week long cruise vacation. Would rather drive across the US then use this plane ever again."
"""giving up on this airline""","Not Verified | After 25 + years I am giving up on this airline. The free bag perk isn't even worth it any more. We flew out of Reno, Chicago, Denver, Newark and Phoenix, all within the past 2 months, & every flight was badly delayed, this last time causing US to pay for a hotel even though our whole trip was with them. To add insult they gave us a place at the end of their line on the next days flight when we had places way up towards the front on the flight they caused us to miss. Not one bit of compensation offered and we watched them give some other people $600 vouchers to get bumped because they overbook their flights. You lose my business both with your airline and with your credit card after being a loyal customer all these years, thanks for treating me like worse than nothing."
"""diminished with customer service""","Not Verified | Austin to San Diego. In February I flew with SWA from Denver to Austin. I arrived early at the airlines and was allowed to fly standby on an available flight. I explained this to the lady and she responded with, “we just don’t let random people on those seats, we would lose revenue” as she was holding my active duty military ID. Her supervisor then said, “you should have not bought such a restrictive ticket”. SWA has really diminished in the past years with customer service. Her attitude really was rude and unprofessional. Additionally if you do it at one airport you should do it at all or none."
"""SouthWest lost our luggage""","Not Verified | Our family flew on a direct flight from San Antonio to Orlando. SouthWest lost our luggage and claimed that it never left San Antonio. Southwest also admitted that they do not track passengers luggage. Sounds like a serous security issue to me, our luggage has been floating around San Antonio airport for a month and a half but no one at southwest can find it. How is Southwest allowed to run an airline business without tracking passengers luggage? What are those tags for, you put on our luggage ? Dealing with customer service was horrible. Luggage claims experience has been similar : rude and useless. We thought southwest cared about their customers. Apparently not."
"""This was a poor experience""","Not Verified | I am extremely disappointed with this airline. First time and last time for me. What a poor experience. I was supposed to fly from Orange County to Oakland. 1 hour 30 min before the flight, I got a text to tell me that my flight was cancelled. They booked me a flight the next day. The worst part: My original flight was nonstop (1 hour 30 min flight). However, the new flight was with a lay over through Las Vegas (almost 6 hours), even though direct flights were available. I received no compensation for this significant inconvenience. I had to call twice to get a flight from LAX to Oakland. In addition, I had to pay for an extra ride to a further airport and arrive very late at home. This was a poor experience with even worse customer service."
"""timing is not their thing""","✅ Trip Verified | Reno to Phoenix. I would say Southwest is unreliable in terms of timing, especially out of Reno. Sometimes they are on time, but I can say without hesitation, there are other airlines who are more reliable in terms of timing. Also Southwest aircraft are not the cleanest (food on floor, dirt between seats, etc). That said, they are cheap, flexible, easy changes, good bag allowance, good staff. But timing is not their thing."
"""Terrible customer service""","Not Verified | Las Vegas to Long Beach. Terrible customer service, they assigned us the seats number, but when boarding, much to our surprise, some people already occupied our seats, when we requested to seat together they said we have to pay 30 dollars more per person, we are already paid close to 300 dollars for the one hour flight; Highway robbery in America! We definitely flying Jet Blue next time, because they have the ability to guarantee our seats and no surprises!"
"""impressedwith the flight staff""","✅ Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to Phoenix. I am not a fan of flying. However, I want to say how impressed I was with the flight staff on flight 1703 from Pitts to Phoenix. (July 23, 2019) They were super friendly, accomodating, humorous and in general, overall rock stars. As a contractor, I know how you never hear the good things; the focus is commonly on the negative. I am sure it is very much the same for them. They immediately apologized to many of us for the flight delay (only delayed 30 minutes). And instantly went into ""go mode"" to make us comfortable and less stressed. If you have some capacity of letting them know the service they gave was above and beyond, it would be greatly appreciated."
"""belt for the luggage broke""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Lousiville. A belt for the luggage broke so we sat on our plane for over 1 1/2 hours. Very inconvenient when you were supposed to get home by 9 pm and had to get up at 6 am for work the next day!"
"""customer service was outstanding""","Not Verified | Portland to St. Louis. I haven't always been a Southwest fan but I wasn't able to make a recent flight due to unforeseen events. The customer service was outstanding! Very compassionate customer service and I will be a dedicated Southwest customer moving forward."
"""dissatisfied with my experience""","Not Verified | Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale. I have flown with this airline several times and have only come back for the low prices. The ground customer service is terrible. The people tell you different things, are often confused, and have a bad attitude. Both times i’ve flown southwest recently the plane has been overbooked and they also forced people with 2 carryons to check one, even though you are allowed to check two. The seats aren’t awful but they aren’t very comfortable either. Both time we have checked in practically right at the 24 hour mark when you are allowed to but we still end up in C class. It’s incredibly frustrating because I flew with my daughter who is 10. We were told there would be no problem getting us a seat together but when we got on not only were there no seats together but there was only middle seats left. She was really upset and scared to sit between two strangers. The pick your own seat just isn’t a good system in my opinion, it’s chaotic when you get on a plane, and stressful to find a seat. The on flight wifi is really low quality. The plane staff is fine but they in no way go out of their way to be helpful. I am overall very dissatisfied with my experience with Southwest and I will absolutely never fly with them again and unless you are a single flyer I urge you to choose a different airline too. The lower price is t worth the drop in quality. If you’re looking for a comfortable and low stress trip stay away from Southwest airlines"
"""told we could all board as family""","Not Verified | Indianapolis to Denver. I spent a lot of money on 6 tickets to fly to Denver for my brothers wedding. When we checked our bags in the lady at the counter told us we could board as family due to having 2 of my 4 kids under the age of 6. When it came time time board with family boarding the lady at the gate was trying to make my older boys ages 11 and 13 wait and board at the end with c class! She said only the parents and the children under the age of 6 could board as family. I spent more money on those tickets than probably anyone on that flight! I told the lady at the gate that I was told we could all board as family and she said no! For fear of being kicked off the flight I myself waited with my older boys and boarded last and we were all split up all over the plane and I couldn't get a seat close to my husband to help with the younger kids!"
"""ridiculous customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely ridiculous customer service. Don’t fly Southwest Airlines. Remember, you get what you pay for. If there are any issues that would require customer service assistance from this airline your done for. The nightmare initially begun on the 17th of July when I was scheduled to depart from St. Louis to arrive in Norfolk, VA. Arrive at the Southwest ticketing counter to learn my flight had been cancelled due to weather. Once I learned this, I asked the ticketing agent isn’t it protocol for someone to call, text, or email me the customer, to make them aware of the flight changes. The reply I got was priceless. Basically, my question was ignored. So, now the ticketing agent begins to look in order to rebook my flight. Now, they book me a flight for the very next morning. However, this time I will have to fly from St Louis to Cleveland, OH, then to Chicago, Illinois and then onto a Norfolk. Of course, I accept the reservation thinking all has been resolved and there would be no more issues. So approximately hours later I arrive back in St. Louis airport. I board the first flight from St. Louis thinking I’m finally on my way to my destination and I would be good to go. The plane lands arriving in Cleveland with the pilot coming on the speaker stating, “there’s a weather delay and no one can get in or out of Chicago”! After sitting in Cleveland for almost four hours until finally being cleared for take off to continue the journey now to Chicago and then Norfolk. Finally, land in Chicago approximately three hours after my Southwest connection flight had already departed for Norfolk. I immediately go to Southwest customer service counter to explain what I just went through. First, I’m told all remaining flights are booked going to Norfolk. I’m also told that they can fly me to Baltimore, Maryland the next day, which would be the third day! And I’m also told when I get to Baltimore I would have to be on standby in order to try to get a flight to Norfolk. Now, my frustration is beginning to show. I ask if I would be provided a hotel here in Chicago and I was told no. So, I get no hotel, no later flight, and absolutely nothing at all in order to make up for this inconvenience. Not even a bag of peanuts or even a drink. I always knew this was a suspect airline. However, take it from me. Save your money and go United or Delta. If you don’t and something happens. In my case weather!!! Then, your just throwing your money away. I understand weather is not the airlines fault. However, it’s how the customer service takes care of their customers during that inconvenience is what is being measured. I’m a customer who definitely learns from their mistakes. In short, no one should have to experience this, especially in a strange unfamiliar city and then get told that the best they can do is have me sleep on the floor in the airport and then ride to another strange city to then be placed on standby for the final destination"
"""I am very disappointed""","Not Verified | I am very disappointed in Southwest’s customer service. I booked a flight back in March and just discovered 2 days before my flight that they completely changed my itinerary without notification. I originally selected a 1pm flight out of Atlanta because I live 2 hours away from any airport and they are the closest. So, instead of waking up at 8am and leaving by 9 to make it to the airport at 11am. I now have to wake up at 4am to battle rush hour traffic and get 3 small children through the airport. There is reason I needed that flight time. Any later flights and I am looking at getting at my destination around 10pm-11pm and then Driving another 1.5 hours to get to my destination. When I called to see what could be done the corporate office pretty much told me it wasn’t their problem and there was nothing they could do. I asked if they could get my family a hotel room the night before, after spending thousands on tickets to book a flight you think they could throw me bone, but they said they would not and that again this wasn’t their problem. WOW. I always enjoyed flying with Southwest Because I though they were caring, but apparently this is no longer the case. I guess you get what you pay for."
"""Worst customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Indianapolis to Chicago-Midway. Worst customer service. Flight was delayed due to maintenance issues. We were later boarded with them telling us the issue was fixed. We sat on the plan, didn’t take off. The Captain came in trying to be funny asked a stupid question about how old we all were. Then said we weren’t going because of rain in Chicago. I texted my daughter who lives in Chicago and was told it was total sunshine there. Then the same captain came back 30 minutes later to tell us the real problem was the original problem not weather. During our more than an hour of sitting on the tarmac while the captain and maintenance crew were just trying to figure out why we couldn’t leave, we were offered nothing, no water, nothing! After another 30 minutes we were told the plane wouldn’t be going anywhere it was out of commission. This is almost 3 hours after we were supposed to leave. We were told to deplane and make other arrangements. I stood in a line of 6 people to get refund for an hour and a half. I was then told by extremely rude customer service people I’d have to call their customer relations department to get any compensation for sitting 5 hours in both the airport and on the plane. Horrible customer service! I called the customer relations number they gave me to find out they close at 4 pm EST and I’d have to call back tomorrow!! They could care less about helping people, just want your money. Southwest has gone down the tubes with regards to customer service."
"""starving and tired and hot""","Not Verified | Atlanta to Las Vegas. I would never fly with this airline ever. First the flight pattern was changed. Just as we were getting ready to board the took our plane and sent it to Ft Lauderdale. Then we had to wait for them to locate us a plane. Now I paid for a direct flight. We had to first go to St Louis at which point we were not to change planes. We were taxiing in to unload those not going on with us and we were told to change planes. Then we had to go to Austin prior to Vegas. Now they only offered us food in a snack pack of mini pretzels (child size snack pack). While waiting in Austin to board additional people. The staff were begging no one to open window shades as the A/C was not working properly. It was over booked and very hot. 8 hrs later we land in Las Vegas starving and tired and hot. This airline could careless about our first experience with them"
"""great customer service""","❎ Not Verified | Great. All on time, highly recommend from Lubbock to Dallas. Nonstop, cheap efficient and great value for money. Open seating is not a problem, very comfortable seats and great customer service."
"""It is terrible""","❎ Not Verified | Dallas to Philadelphia. Never use Southwest. It is terrible. We had our flight cancelled 2 times because of technicalities. Our flight was supposed to be on the 11th so we went and our flight got delayed. We stayed there the whole day, then our flight got cancelled. Then we came back the 12th, and we now got a connecting flight from Dallas to Houston to Philadelphia. The one from Houston to Philadelphia got delayed for ""bad weather"", but when we checked, the weather was perfect. Then they were like, sorry we don't know if it will be cancelled or not. So we got another flight and we argued with them this time and on the 13th we finally got a single flight to Philadelphia from Dallas. And we were late to a very important camp all because of Southwest."
"""hectic and annoying flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Columbus to Las Vegas. I like their prices, but unfortunately, it was a very hectic and annoying flight both there and back. Arriving at the airport, we were told we would not be able to make our plane switch, due to the plane we were supposed to get on being delayed so much. So we had to re-schedule for the following morning and had to go clear back home and return to our flight in the morning. but we made it to Vegas. Then on the trip home, the flight was supposed to leave at 6:45 pm. We did not take off until almost 10 pm! We sat on the plane after boarding for over an hour. And then the flight was so bumpy and uncomfortable that I was in tears. It was just an all-around cruddy experience. Again, I love the prices that Southwest offers but for the experience we had, it should be even less. I just don’t think that I can ever fly Southwest again, unfortunately. They were apologetic about all of the delays, especially on the way back. But I still wonder how it could happen. It just seems unprofessional."
"""never again fly this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | So dissatisfied with Southwest. My daughter was checked into her flight last night to fly out today. She received an alert that her flight was cancelled due to mechanical. No other options available no compensation provided. It was too late to cancel hotel and she ended up booking with Alaska and at such a late date, spent double what she will be refunded by Southwest. I will never again fly this airline."
"""I was very disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Charleston to Cleveland via Baltimore. After hearing great things about Southwest Airlines I booked a trip with higher expectations. The cost was reasonable and the fact that you could take two bags was awesome! It was my 4 month olds first time flying and I thought because the reviews were grand we would be just fine on this flight even though there was a connecting flight and layover on both round trip flights. I was very disappointed when we deplaned and were informed that our next flight would be delayed due to the air conditioning on the aircraft going out. What started out as a 30 minute delay became a 3 hour delay with a switch of aircraft. What’s worse? The aircraft we were switched to turned out to be having maintenance issues also. They took an hour to figure that out... then when we were called to board, we were turned around again because the plane had “too much fuel”. What was supposed to be an hour and a half layover turned into 5 hours with a starving 4 month old. I had a rental reservation that had to be pushed back twice, I missed my 95 year old grandmothers birthday party, and I ended up having to rent a car instead of the mini suv that I reserved due to the fact that the could not hold the car for me. This was by far the most uncomfortable and frustrating experience and there were no apologies or attempts at consolation from any of the employees at the airport or on the air craft. So disappointed in Southwest. Don’t fly with an infant you never know with this airline I guess."
"""Treated like cattle""","❎ Not Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Las Vegas. It was poor. We boarded the plane, they made us get off. They put us on another plane. Luggage on a different flight. Treated like cattle. The worst experience ever."
"""experience beyond exceptional""","✅ Trip Verified | I just wanted to say as a previous customer of another airline (which I care not to mention their name) I must say that this was my very first time flying Southwest and my experience was beyond exceptional I have never experienced such outstanding service from the entire staff including the Captain on my return flight. he offered to buy me coffee at Starbucks in Detroit and we talked and laughed along the way. No Airline has been that kind to me ever as Southwest has been on both of my flights!"
"""it has turned in to a mess""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Boston. Awful the plane just arrived and they say that the AC is not working. So they said that we need to wait two hours for another plane to arrive. It’s only an hour long flight and it has turned in to a mess. The workers are being unhelpful and telling people to go talk to the people at the other gate (where no people are working)."
"""sad excuse for an airline""","Not Verified | Tampa to Kansas City. I know better than to choose Southwest, but somehow I did. The customer service was horrid. My 11 year old son was flying by himself. He checked no bags. The ticketing agent wouldn’t let me go with him over to the plane and help him make sure he knew where to go. She also wouldn’t let me use my KTN for him to go through TSA Pre, though when I travel with him on other airlines he gets to go through TSA Pre because I do. He’s too young and isn’t eligible for TSA Pre yet. The ticketing agent was rude and weirdly aggressive. I’m definitely never flying this joke of an airline again. If it were just me I’d have no issue, but to do this to an 11 year old is unconscionable. Especially when it was so busy and my son already was nervous and confused. I almost walked over to one of the better airlines and just purchased him a new plane ticket. You definitely get what you pay for with this sad excuse for an airline."
"""shocked at how things were so bad""","Not Verified | Minneapolis to Cancun via Chicago-Midway. After having a flawless flight to Cancun I was shocked at how things were so bad trying to get back to MSP. After leaving Cancun and told we were going to land in Chicago-we circled Chicago for over 20 min because of bad weather. Then told we were running low on fuel-we had to land in St. Louis to refuel. Then waiting on paperwork...we were finally ready to head back to Chicago. After landing in Chicago we were told we had to stay on the plane for an hour because we were not near customs. After 15 min we were able to get off the plane and get through customs and get our luggage. After all of that delay and when we got to a Southwest agent-he told us the next flight back to MSP would take us BACK to St. Louis and then to Ohio and end in MSP! No Way! So the Southwest agent said, “If you think you can make your flight-go ahead and try!” So I booked it through security with many nice people letting me go ahead of them and starting at B1...I RAN to B26. Sweating and panting I made it to my gate with many “C” people still waiting to board. Hooray! (I was an “A” person.) I gave the ticketing agent my ticket and he called someone and said, “She has a ticket, but she is not coming up.” Then asked me to speak with a gate agent. WELL- MY SEAT HAD BEEN GIVEN AWAY SINCE NO ONE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE THE FLIGHT!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT??? With many people STILL waiting to board! Just unreal! They would do NOTHING for me but tell me I had a 9:50pm flight as my only option! Then they tell me I’m the last seat! A “C”-not an “A” like I was last time! Even though I asked if I could “please” get on earlier! No one was helpful at all-such a shame to leave our resort in Mexico where everyone was kind and helped in any way they could! Large disappointment to end a week of vacation! Really had a different view of Southwest Airlines after this return flight!"
"""be made to control their animal""","✅ Trip Verified | Little Rock to Ontario via Phoenix. This was the worse flight of my life. There were 2 claim to be service animals on my flight. 1 of the dogs seem to really be a service animal because it was very chilled and quiet. The other was barking, jumping on people, the owner even let it loose on the plane doing the flight. Prior to boarding I witness this dog doing all of this, so when I was boarding it was hanging out into the middle of the isle, I asked the flight attendant if he could ask the owner to please hold the dog so I could board, I have extremely high anxiety and fear of dogs. He rudely said no, i'm not its a service dog. I said I understand but I have a disability also and I need to board. He rudely said, I am not going to tell another person how or what to do with their dog. A few people on the flight heard him and said Miss, let me help you and blocked the dog so I could get by. Shortly after plane took off, the dog was loose on the plane, a female flight attendant told the owner he would have to keep the dog with him. I don't have a problem with people that need and/or require service animals, but I do think they should be made to control their animal. I paid almost $800 for my ticket was travel for bereavement of close family and then force to have to deal with my anxiety attack because of this one dog that was clearly not a service animal. This was the worse experience flying ever and I fly often."
"""Worst experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Memphis. Worst experience ever. Traveling with 3 children and 5 items of luggage. Our flight got weather delayed and missed our last connecting flight. No one on the plane or after exiting the plane was able to help. No one offered a hotel or even a ride with one adult three children, a car seat and four checked bags and a carry on for everyone. We ended up having to stay and even while in line with all these bags and children I was asking for help and all the employees said: “I can’t I’m monitoring lines.” Monitoring lines. Then after rechecking our bags, I got a call to find our new tags were not added. Which means they probably won’t end up at our final destination. I can’t wait for this day to be over just so I never have to fly Southwest again!"
"""Keep up the good work""","Not Verified | Oakland to Vancouver. Renee at Oakland airport service desk was amazing. She assisted me with a flight change to leave earlier than my scheduled departure. She also provided a complimentary drink ticket which I didn't realize! I really appreciate your assistance and wanted to thank you. Keep up the good work and thank you for everything you do."
"""This is 100% unacceptable""","Not Verified | I regretfully feel obligated to report my experience this previous weekend 6/22 regarding Southwest Airlines and their Southwest Vacations. I have been a loyal supporter of Southwest for over 15 years, and have had nothing but superior customer service and great experiences until this unfortunate event. I went to Southwest as I always do and decided to use their Southwest Vacations options since I was staying at a hotel this trip. Everything was fine, or so I thought, untill 6/22 my scheduled departure date. I go online to check in to my flight only to find out that my flight has been cancelled without notification to me. Surprised I call Southwest and try to understand what has happened. After about 2 hours on hold I was told that my flight was cancelled due to weather and that I had unknowingly booked through a 3rd party and not Southwest themselves, despite using the Southwest official website to book. After a 20 minute conversation I was forced to leave the following day as there were no flights remaining that day (unless I could get to the gate within 10 minutes), causing me to miss previously scheduled and paid for events that could not be made up or refunded. I then call the hotel and try to cancel my room since I will not be staying there and they said that since I booked though Southwest Vacations, they had to cancel the room and refund me. Did not seem like an issue. Fast forward to today, 6/27. I finally am back and get to speak with customer relations from Southwest. Thinking that this should not be much of an issue as they had miscommunication on their end, they could refund me for the nights stay that I would miss as they called and cancelled the night with the hotel, and would be able to compensate me in some manor for the error of not contacting me to allow me to get on a different flight earlier that day that had availability, and some possible compensation for the events that were missed. During the conversation with the agent for Southwest, she specifically said that ""They would take responibility"" for the error as Southwest Vacations is subcontracted though a 3rd party administrator. Even though it bears the offical Southwest logo, is accessed though their Official website, they contract out that to another party, but she still stated ""they would (were taking) take responsibility"" I think, great we can get this taken care of, to only have Southwest offer me a $50 voucher. $50 to cover 3 missed events, a premium room on Saturday night in Las Vegas, and a lost day of my vacation. This is 100% unacceptable as they themselves took responsibility for the error and still refused to at the very least refund me the money for the hotel room that was never used and some gesture for the error. I can not believe that Southwest who allows their logo and namesake to be used to mislead loyal customers into using something that they promote on their website, but then do not stand behind even though it holds their name is despicable. I felt disrespected as a loyal customer to be offered $50 for what was a loss of 20 times that amount. Southwest, if you are going to license out your name to a separate company, back them and have a system in place to contact clients, or do not promote them on your official website to defraud your loyal customers."
"""repeatedly screwed us over""","✅ Trip Verified | New Orleans to San Francisco via San Diego. Where do I begin? This is our first time flying Southwest since August of 2018 and to fully explain my frustration with their customer service I’ll have to start with the story of them cancelling both of our flights and leaving us with no other option than for us to pay 1.2k each for tickets back home in order to catch our out of country flight the next day. We are both wedding photographers and were leaving New Orleans to head to Baltimore for a wedding. The morning of our flight, about two hours prior, we received a notification from Southwest Airlines that our flight was cancelled. They provided us with alternative flight options, which we selected and then put us on standby (without communicating this with us). Fast forward, after a 10+ hour travel day we made it to Baltimore a little after midnight. Keep in mind the direct flight is normally 2.5 hours. The morning of our returning flight from Baltimore to New Orleans we received yet another cancellation notification. However, this time the link to their flight change wasn’t working, no flights were available to select and the help call line to book another flight had a wait time of 2-3 hours. And so I waited, because we didn’t really have any other option. And each time they picked up the call they disconnected us, leaving us with literally zero alternative flight options or any way to get in touch with Southwest Airlines. This charade continued on until 4pm in the afternoon, no contact from southwest, no alternative flights, they straight up cancelled our flights and gave us nothing in return. Because we were leaving the country the next day we had no other choice than to pay 1.2k for a ticket out of Baltimore. Southwest Airlines finally got in touch with us a few days later, not acknowledging any lack in their system, pretending as though the day of our cancelled departure never happened. They offered us a $75 voucher for our trouble. What. A. Joke. Now a year later in hopes that southwest has their stuff together, we’ve boarded our plane from New Orleans only for them to tell us an engine failed to stay on. They asked us to switch planes, no biggie. This stuff happens. Two hours later and we’re finally boarding the next plane. We miss our connecting flight in San Diego due to their delay and end up waiting another two hours for our next flight. They call us to the front desk to adjust our tickets (A group, what’s up - yes, we were quick, we were prepared!) and they had us boarding at the back of the plane. I kid you not. They not only delayed us by 4+ hours but they didn’t even have the courtesy of taking care of us by allowing us to board in our original position, or even during pre-boarding. Come on southwest, we were loyal before you repeatedly screwed us over. So while, Southwest is great with their checked bags, and while it’s awesome that you can be flexible with them, remember there’s a massive chance they’ll cancel your flight and leave you having to spend a couple grand on a new flight and then pretend that never happened."
"""so upset with Southwest Airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | El Paso to Oklahoma via Dallas. What happened to all those employees who help in time of need? There were kids on the ground exhausted, people in distress by the boat load. You guys are so quick to tell good stories and how your employees help. They all went home to bed, the few that were there I could tell were bothered by the chaos and had no answers for anyone. There was one employee walking down the long line of people. I thought finally someone to help give us an update. No she was just trying to figure out why so many hundreds of people were in line at such a late hour. I guess if I didn’t start recruiting people at midnight to help find a taxi, UBER or Lyft to Oklahoma I would have slept on the floor and I think your staff would have left thinking that seems wild. It felt like we were treated just like that a wild animal who didn’t belong in the airport. Left @ 12:30pm from El Paso Texas Flight delayed while on plane 655pm due to fuel gauge? The ramp got stuck and there was an electrical problem. Still stuck on the plane. Pilot in disbelief and apologies We wait back in the boarding area only to be told the flight is canceled, hundreds of people get in line. All the staff looked panicked with no words of comfort to a lot of sleepy, tired angry people. We wait for hours to be told no flights till Tuesday, no vouchers for hotel, no rental cars available, too late to rent by midnight. 1am looking for a place to sleep. Decide to start asking Uber and Lyft after 5 drivers refusing to drive that far. I tried to go back into airport and they wouldn’t let me in. I’m tired, stuck with a floor to sleep on. I call Southwest Airlines 1800 number lady tells me she can’t refund my money because I’m attached to my bags. I’m told by other customer after Storm was over many other flights took off. Yet we were canceled. I took lyft to drive us to Oklahoma city. Now its 6.24 I need to figure out how to get my bags and rental car. what a nightmare I'm so upset with Southwest Airlines right now, they left me stranded, and for some reason decided our plane was canceled while others continued to leave to their destination."
"""had the whole gate area engaged""","✅ Trip Verified | New Orleans to Austin. Flight 2190 was delayed leaving New Orleans because of weather elsewhere but Janez at Gate 4B at Louis Armstrong Airport in New Orleans, La kept everyone in good spirits. She had the whole gate area engaged in a sing-a-long with incoming passengers; more than once inviting passersby to join in the fun. She went above and beyond her duty as a gate agent to insure that our day would not be ruined by a delayed schedule. Thanks to Janez and Southwest, frustrations were eased and smiles were plentiful!"
"""extremely poorly handled""","✅ Trip Verified | Oakland to Seattle. After being an hour late on mechanical issues, then loaded and taxing around then returned to the gate. Finally they bored a cop to escort off a passenger that ""wasn't listening to attendants"" along with his family. While doing it, the attendant joked about how cute folks thought the cop was. It was extremely poorly handled and now we are going to be 3 hours late. The keystone cops and attendants could not find their luggage. It was the worst flight I have had in the last 2 months and I have been on 5 business trips, so 10 flights. Now we have to gas up and get ok to leave again. Maybe we will never get there."
"""won’t fly them ever again""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Houston with Southwest Airlines. They cancelled the original flight, re-scheduled a new flight, delayed it three times. Too unreliable, I won’t fly them ever again, even if I have to pay more."
"""food and beverages substantial""","Not Verified | Flew Southwest back in June from Philadelphia to Kansas City via St. Louis and enjoyed the experience.

The flight was canceled with no explanation given. Then they rebooked us to another flight that would leave 4 hours later. This meant we had to hang around for 4 hours in the airport. Then once it came for us to board see flight delayed for an hour, once again no explanation. Will never fly Southwest again."
"""Overall pretty average""","✅ Trip Verified | Burbank to San Jose. Overall pretty average. Staff was pretty good. Came with snacks and drinks. Inflight entertainment on app worked fine.

Not only did I spend over 10 hours on the Nashville airport floor sleeping on 6/9 because of flights and delays and no accommodations, I have now spent 7+ hours waiting at the providence airport on 6/13 Southwest Airlines where the staff here seem a little rude. I’ve been pushed to the side, delayed, and just have received poor customer service. My flights have been canceled twice now but have other flights flying from and to the same place through the same weather that has canceled my own flight, interesting. Now I have to arrange all my plans, spend more money, drive an hour to Orlando because the quickest way in was to Tampa, I missed work last week during that fight cancelation, I have to rent a car tonight, etc etc. It is just a little baffling there hasn’t been one employee to help accommodate completely ruining all of my plans and pushing me to the side when another customer decided his question was more important. I was told I’m getting two 50 dollar vouchers to southwest by a nice phone employee (the only one who seems somewhat reasonable) but I’ve been sitting here for 4 hours and haven’t received an email about that. Nice."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Not Verified | Las Vegas to Nashville. The tag on the bag came off from Las Vegas to Denver. I was called about the bag, in the terminal. Thankfully the man from Southwest called me and made sure the bag was put on the right plane. It was great customer service."
"""Thank you Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | On June 6 th my family was headed to my sisters wedding from El Paso TX to Island Park Idaho, where I was to be her bridesmaid. We landed in Salt Lake City. All of our luggage made it safely except one, the most important one. None of our clothes arrived. Being that we had a 4 hour drive we were not able to wait for it and later discovered it didn’t arrive until 9 pm or so. Staff member from baggage claim in Salt Lake did everything she possibly could to try and get me our luggage but fed ex wasn’t delivering over the weekend that far from Salt Lake. She told me to get clothes and necessities and Southwest would reimburse us. They did. She spoke with her manager and then called me back to see if someone could drive back and get the luggage they would give us a travel credit voucher. Unfortunately we could not but we still received a travel voucher. So we made the best of it. Upon return to Salt Lake airport the staff were wonderful, I gave them my receipts and they promptly wrote us a check to reimburse us for what we had spent on clothes. They retrieved our luggage. These unfortunate incidents do happen and although it does inconvenience one, it is not the end of the world. Thank you Southwest for making us feel better about our situation."
"""thank you so much for all you have done""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Atlanta to Norfolk Virgina to go to Outer Banks, on June 3rd. Left on June 9th from Norfolk back to Atlanta. It was a rough day. Flights were canceled all over. After a very long day and many flight changes I made it home safe, but my bags were lost. I was exhausted and frustrated. I had made a very dumb mistake and had something in my baggage that was very expensive. I was sick, I went to claim office and filed lost baggage. Was told and filed loss. Was told my baggage would be returned next day. I received a call next day it was found and would be returned by 8pm that night. Sure enough it was. I am very happy to report all was in my bags, the item I was most concerned about was in bag along with all else. I don’t fly much but when I do it is usually Southwest. Have to say that will be my number one from now on. Most staff I dealt with were amazing. Have only one regret, the man who delivered to me was the nicest man and regret I did not get his name. Southwest, thank you so much for all you have done."
"""very pleased with Southwest""","Not Verified | Baltimore to Palm Beach. I was very pleased with Southwest Airlines - I fly with them often and on 5/25/19 there were mechanical problems and the pilots timed out so we had to wait for a new crew. Southwest safely got us to west palm beach, although late, and then gave us a $75 Southwest Airlines voucher for our next flight. They managed the issues that were no fault of their own superbly."
"""Southwest no more""","✅ Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Washington. Disgusting. Flight out of Milwaukee on June 9th was moved two times, by several hours and ended up being a red eye, because they forgot they needed a first officer for a scheduled flight. Agents at gate C23 in MKE said there are no other options and no compensation. And I could not be routed to another airline because they don't have a contract. Their supervisors were rude, gave me a phone number for a closed customer support, and when I told them I will tweet about my experience, one of the supervisors said he could care less, as Southwest PR department will take care of any negative comments. This is the third time Southwest has completely messed up my work this year without any follow up or customer service. Three of three trips. Southwest no more."
"""absolute worse service""","Not Verified | Montego bay to Cincinnati. The absolute worse service & guarantee the other 109 passengers on this 4x delayed now cancelled flight would agree. Horrible service would be a lie. This is horrendous in every sense. The staff has been lazy, not helpful & very slow getting basic information to the passengers. If if were only me this wouldn't bother me so much. Having my 6yr old son with me at 1031pm still waiting to here about tomorrow's flight & what hotel were staying in frustrating. Our original flight was suppose to leave at 355pm."
"""I'm just out for the flight!""","Not Verified | I got no confirmation for my flight so I thought I must have forgotten to complete the reservation. 2 months later I realized I had been charged and after calling Southwest they said there had been a typo in my email address (.com was .cvm). They had my phone and could have reached out or someone could have noticed that I had misspelled .com and resent the email but they made no effort! The person I spoke to on the phone was rude and just said 'well you made the mistake'. I'm just out for the flight! Thanks Southwest!"
"""Southwest ruined our vacation""","Not Verified | We were flying out of Dallas to Rochester for a wedding, the flight was delayed & cancelled, we had a wedding to attend the next day, they put us on a flight flying to Buffalo Ny, I was forced to check in my carryon luggage, I had all my clothes, toiletries for the wedding. Our luggage was lost. We stayed in a hotel in Buffalo & paid for it. The baggage claim for lost luggage service was so rude. Southwest Airlines ruined our vacation. They overbook their flights. The service is terrible. If you are attending an important event or a short visit. I will not pick that airline."
"""my children were far from me""","Not Verified | Southwest Airlines is not an excellent option, because that system of free seats does not work. Groups of families traveling with minors within the ages of 10-15 can be separated from their parents by not finding a seat where they are together. I traveled from San Juan to Miami and back and my children at the ages of 13 and 16 were far from me and my husband."
"""obligated to check on those minors2","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Cleveland. My daughter is 12 and when I asked a Southwest representative If someone would check on my daughter or sit with my daughter to ensure of her safety while flying alone sitting next to complete strangers, I was advised my daughter was an adult and is on her on while flying. I was livid to hear at 12 no flight attendant would check on the safety of my child. If this is your policy the protocol needs to be change immediately for the safety of our children. I am uncomfortable sending my child on Southwest Airlines knowing that no Southwest employee is obligated to check on those minors flying unaccompanied!"
"""We got free drinks""","Not Verified | Los Angeles to Phoenix. We boarded 5 minutes early, departed on time, & landed on time. We got free drinks, free peanuts, & free pretzels. But I then flew on Southwest again from Phoenix to Little Rock & also had a amazing experience. Those were my first 2 times on Southwest."
"""Worst flight and customer service""","Not Verified | Minneapolis to Sacramento via Denver. Worst flight and customer service experience ever experienced. I can understand that weather is out of their control but it’s how the flight changes were dealt with and poor customer service received that prompted this review. We were flying from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Sacramento on a Sunday over Memorial Day weekend. Unfortunately there was a layover in Denver and we missed the connecting flight. Automatically rebooked the flight to the following evening and they did not offer any accommodations. Also, because we were put on standby for the earliest flight the next day their system removed us from the confirmed flight the following day even though we were fifth in line for standby. They did not tell us this ahead of time and we slept in the airport because we would’ve paid $150 for 4 hrs of sleep since we would have to go thru security once more in the morning. When we did not make the cut for the following morning flight the later evening flight no longer had spots available. After two hours, and three service reps later we finally came across a service rep who cared enough to search for an earlier available flight to Sacramento. Abdenbi was so great and a blessing to our rough experience. Regardless I will never again voluntarily travel with southwest. They should have handled this better by making it right with anything (coupon voucher accommodation, etc.)"
"""courteous and helpful""","Not Verified | Newark to Santa Ana. This was our first flight on Southwest Airlines. We had several delays because of weather and had to sit for hours. The staff was so courteous and helpful. Everyone was apologetic and tried to accommodate whenever possible. In Particular, our customer service rep out of Newark, Ramon went above and beyond to get us to our destination. He checked in with us often to make us feel more at ease right up til we boarded our plane. Kudos to him! It was great to see so many smiling faces from that airline. Thank you to all."
"""is the worst airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Oklahoma City to Las Vegas. This is the worst airline I have flown in my 61 years, never again. It was not cheap by any means, I traveled with my wife and 2 children, we couldn’t find any seats even close to each other’s, very disorganized, flight attendants rude, not welling to help. Never again"
"""horrible experience we had""","✅ Trip Verified | We had a flight from San Antonio to Colorado to Vegas for Thursday at 7:45pm we had a wedding to get too. Our flight got delayed so we wouldn’t be flying out till 11:30. We sat at the airport all night for a few hours and then They offered all of the passengers $100 vouchers. As we went to get our $100 vouchers they said our flight was canceled it would be too late for us to leave from Colorado to Vegas when it landed so they said they Can re book us. They rebooked us to fly out of San Antonio BUT they split us up and we all are having to arrive at separate times ranges from early morning to late afternoon. We lost a night of a hotel we had already paid for because the hotel wouldn’t let us save our night for another one. We missed the wedding we were going for and one of our friends was stuck without a hotel since we wouldn’t get there till the next day to check In for her since it was underneath one of our names. Very disappointed they did a horrible job in accommodating us for the horrible experience we had. The lady said it’s out of her hands and we can either re book or leave it alone. Southwest Airlines has done nothing to make us feel like we didn’t lose out on time, hotel money and food and our friend was left stranded alone in the Vegas airport for a whole night."
"""first choice whenever possible""","✅ Trip Verified | We flew Southwest with a connection through Phoenix to San Antonio on March 20th. We boarded in Phoenix and weather in Texas caused a delay of over two hours. The staff was nothing but accommodating. Obviously they can't control the weather. Besides being polite and accommodating when we did finally get going they gave the entire plane a free drink service and then we woke up to find a 100.00 coupon in our emails for future travel. Southwest puts the ridiculous budget airlines to shame and will be our first choice whenever possible."
"""Will not be a repeat customer""","✅ Trip Verified | Austin to Phoenix. Our 7:15 a.m. flight was cancelled about an hour in advance, and the next available seats were the next day at 1:30 p.m. Southwest does not go the extra mile to help you reach your destination; they are not willing to work with other airlines, even when the responsibility for a canceled flight is on them. It’s unfortunate that the best they could manage was a 30 hour delay. My husband and I were planning our anniversary trip for months, and due to Southwest’s operations, we essentially lost two days of travel. Will not be a repeat customer."
"""disaster to incredibly happy""","Not Verified | I thought I had left early enough to get to the airport on time, but I grossly underestimated how long things sometimes take for parking, checking bags, etc. My original flight was supposed to leave at 5:30, but I had just gotten started getting my bags checked at 5:15. It wouldn't let me verify my flight in their system, but within a minute or so the employee had asked if I wanted to be rebooked on another flight at 5:50 going to the same place. So very quickly I went from disaster to incredibly happy, and the rebooking was free of charge. I thanked him, and even still managed to get a good seat on the first flight. Very nice gesture that my late but very much appreciated!!!"
"""no guarantee about the seat""","Not Verified | Las Vegas to Oakland. Never flown Southwest before this trip to the USA. Overall rating would be quite good, save for their seat policy. In Europe or Asia I've flown low cost airlines which, (sometimes for a small premium fee), allow you to choose your seat in advance. With Southwest you are only allowed to pay a, substantial, fee to be among the first to board, but with no guarantee about the seat. Should they allow seat reservation for a normal fee they would make a big improvement in what already is a good airline."
"""Very unhappy customer""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Denver. Watched staff let all of A and B class take on more than one bag then forced people in other classes to stow all baggage regardless of their willingness. The agent was very disappointing in her response to why my single bag had to be checked while other were allowed to bring two or even three bags. She simply lied and said that didn’t happen them started saying sir over and over in a condescending manner. I finally just walked on the plane no ticket for my bag no idea if I’ll ever see it again. Why can’t I have a ticket for my single bag that I paid to bring on to the plane? Extremely condescending employee. Very unhappy customer."
"""I have decided to switch to Southwest""","Not Verified | Good afternoon. I wanted to take a minute to say thank you and share with you why you have converted me from another airline for life. My wife’s Grandmother was in her last days and hours of her life, the last week of March this year. My wife and I had planned on traveling to see her and had a ticket purchased already for my wife and one of my daughters, but we needed it changed and needed to get me and my other daughter a flight. For my work, I travel quite frequently from Nashville to Dallas among other places on another airline. Because of my status I like them to continue to build points with them. I called them first to book myself and my daughter a flight to Phoenix. They were of no assistance, would not budge on the price for an emergency, and would still charge me a large amount to move my points. I hung up. My wife then called Southwest. Not only did they get us booked last minute, they adjusted the pricing for an emergency, and helped us the whole way thru it moving our points around etc.. Even when we got to the airport, they bumped us to an even earlier flight to get us there as quickly as possible. What a blessing it was to fly with you. If we would have gone with the other airline, or had we not been bumped up to an earlier flight, we would not have made it in time to see her grandmother before she passed. We arrived within less than 2 hours of her passing. What you do for people every day may seem routine, but for us, it was a life changing moment. Having my wife be there before her grandmother passed means more to me than I can possibly express to you. As a result, I have decided to switch to Southwest for all of my work and personal trips going forward even though I do not have status with you. Sometimes I fly out of Knoxville where you do not service, but other than that, I will forever use you now. Thank you for making such a hard time for my family, just a little easier."
"""lost trust in Southwest""","Not Verified | Raleigh Durham to Austin via St Louis. My flight was scheduled for 8:00 pm departure. It was delayed waiting for passenger on a flight from Orlando. It looked like I might miss the connection in St. Louis. I checked at the service desk in Raleigh. They called and assured me that the plane would wait in St. Louis. I get to St Louis and I get off the plane and the flight to Austin is delayed 2 hours. I will arrive at 2:00 AM. I use lyft and I doubt that they will running at that time and I live 40 minutes from the airport. They couldn’t offer me a room in St Louis or any alternative. I really feel they are not telling me the truth. I have lost trust in Southwest. They are no longer my preferred airline."
"""on hold for almost 2 hours""","Not Verified | Nashville to St. Louis. After a two month wait and being promised by a customer care rep that my rapid rewards points would be restored (since I had account activity in the last 24 months) within 10-14 days, I found out (after being on hold for almost 2 hours total) that my request was elevated and denied by the administrative division at SWA. I will grease my butt and slide to my destination before I ever fly Southwest again! I don't know why they call it ""customer care"" because I can assure you Southwest could care less about their customers!"
"""What a miserable service""","✅ Trip Verified | What should have been a six-hour flight was changed to a 12-hour flight with 3 layovers. Pretty annoying. We left Philly, got to Dallas Lovefield airport and sat there for 1.5 hours. Then a flight to Albuquerque. Then to Las Vegas. Finally back to Spokane after that. We begged multiple times over multiple phone calls and emails to have our flight changed back or at least a voucher. So far, nothing but a ""sorry"". What a miserable service."
"""prices are low because their level is low""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Oakland. A worst airline you can imagine. They do not assign seat numbers, overbooked the flight, no place for baggage. I will not recommend Southwest Airlines to anyone. Yes their prices are low because their level is low."
"""such a miserable trip""","Not Verified | My handicapped sister and I were to fly from BNA to LAX via Atlanta. Several passengers experienced a St Louis flight cancellation. We all sat on the plane until they figured out how to help them. In the meantime several more of us missed our connections as we sat on the aircraft. Those of us who missed our connection to LAX were sent first to New Orleans then to Austin, then to Phoenix arriving much later than our scheduled flight arrival time. We were exhausted, couldn't get off the plane to get something to eat. Having arrived many hours later than scheduled, we missed our prepaid shuttle at LAX that would have taken us to Ventura, not exactly an inexpensive cab ride home. I have been looking for the card given to me by the lady who helped us at the baggage claim area of customer service for Southwest. She found us a room because we were stranded. I'm very grateful to her for helping us. Its hard to believe Southwest put us in this position and made such a miserable trip of it."
"""just a terrible airline""","Not Verified | Orlando to Saint Louis. We only got 3 of the 4 bags we checked on a direct flight. The employees are clueless and lazy. The little bag of pretzels and quarter can of Sprite to wash it down with is insufficient. All around just a terrible airline and lousy experience."
"""It couldn't have gone any worse""","✅ Trip Verified | I took a returning flight from SJO to FLL yesterday with my 68yr old father who has Parkinson's. When I got off the plane there was no assistance. It was a complete disaster trying to get through baggage, declorations, and customs. I booked my flight to SJO with Spirit Air, who clearly at booking gives option for Wheelchair Assistance. Everything on the Spirit flight went smoothly. Not the case at all with Southwest. It couldn't have gone any worse. When I contacted Southwest customer service, I was completely dismissed and was told it was the airports problem. I was also told I should have not used the app and booked online so I could drop down a box some place and choose Wheelchair assistance. Doesn't sound so handicap friendly. Regardless I arrived at the airport 3 hours before my flight so I could get this handled and was left on my own with my father who can walk far with consistent tremors and dementia. Customer service could not careless."
"""the most horrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Austin to Houston. This trip which ended in Alabama was the most horrible experience I’ve had in all the years of traveling first the company that I went to work for chose the least expensive way to get me to the location. When I boarded the plane I was wearing a leather jacket that was owned by my stepfather who had passed away it was handed down to me for years. I had admired this jacket and I decided to take it with me for good luck at my sales event however it was rather bulky so when I got on the plane they were full and the airline stewardess asked if I would put the jacket in the above head storage. I’ve heard horror stories of arguing with a flight attendant and have seen too many movies so I complied and put it in the overhead bin. However I did not realize of the seating arrangements which is open seating when you get on the plane so the only seats that were available were the center seats which left me at a disadvantage where I couldn’t see the overhead bin that my jacket was it So when we landed I had to wait for everyone to move in order to get out of my seat and by the time I got to the bin where my jacket was to be it was gone I of course did not get upset because again did not want to be escorted off the plane so I asked as I got off about my jacket they said they would check on it once I get off. I waited about 15 minutes or so no one came out finally someone came out and said they could not find my jacket and that I would have to report it online because they had no one there to take the report which I thought was odd as a customer service gesture. When I finally spoke to them they told me that I need to report it online, after I done so all I heard from them is we haven’t found it we haven’t found it to this day. I have not heard from them again it’s as if they don’t care what happens to your belongings and they have no sense of responsibility how sad for the general public"
"""Staff is happy""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Chicago. I love southwest. The airport is near downtown. Flight are on time. Free wifi for messaging and movies with southwest app. Two bags allowed to check in and no cancellation fee. American has 200$ rebooking fees for any airline credit u get. Staff is happy and want to help."
"""delayed and finally canceled""","✅ Trip Verified | Probably would not have been a bad experience if timing wasn't important but we had a connecting flight to meet up with a group of travelers to experience the adventure that most only hope to live. You look over the the rude comments and answers to your questions while checking in and think well I guess “you get what you pay for”. But when the flight was delayed, delayed, delayed and finally canceled. We start scrambling to make the connection only to be told I apologize sir all flights are booked (while looking through those glazed over eyes of I really don’t care sir please step aside so I can brush off the man behind you) we can put you on a flight tomorrow and there’s nothing more we can do. But our connecting flight with the group departs tonight. Again expression doesn’t change “I apologize”. I’m sure she was only caring out the script she had previously rehearsed in a training send down from corporate. Well we missed our connecting flight and because of the logistics will miss the first two days of the journey. I feel bad I was difficult today, I guess you get what you pay for. I assure you this airline will never have to apologize to me again"
"""Terrible customer service""","Not Verified | Indianapolis to San Diego with Southwest Airlines. Terrible customer service. Changed my flight from a non-stop to 1 stop. Ruined my one vacation that I get every year. Horrible ""customer relations"" wouldn't let me speak to anyone apart from a staff member =who kept repeating that there was nothing they could do."
"""taken a sharp turn for the worse","Not Verified | Austin to Phoenix. Southwest had cancelled our returning flight and moved us to an earlier flight and were never notified us of the change. When we showed up at the airport they told us we missed our flight. The ""supervisor"" basically told us it was our fault because the only thing we had to show him was our original booking document. He said, ""Oh that document is from February, so it doesn't count"", but he never even claimed that we had been notified of the change. We ended up wasting an extra eight hours at the airport. Southwest has screwed up three of the last five trips we have taken with them. Their customer service has taken a sharp turn for the worse."
"""never fly Southwest again""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Phoenix. Don't check bags on this airline!! Worst service ever. Injured back and needed to check all my bags to avoid carry on. Checked two bags. When i arrived in Phoenix one bag was delivered to the baggage claim area the other was not. Of course its my bag that includes laptop, along with keys to my truck, keys to my shop and many important documents. When i asked the southwest rep where my bag was she told me to wait and see if it shows up on the next flight. Its 9am here and the next plane lands at 2:40pm. The rep could not track my bag or find its location. I can't even file a claim on the bag until after 3pm today. This airline is a joke. You get what you pay for i guess. I will never fly Southwest again."
"""switching to American""","✅ Trip Verified | Our family of 10 booked tickets to the Dominican Republic, and they cancelled the flight going home. They have another flight the following day, and they said there is nothing they can do. It will cost us $1,200 to stay in a hotel near the airport for another day. The top tier customer service line said they cannot offer vouchers and almost directly said they don't care. They've offered vouchers to offset costs for hour-long delays before at airports (I've seen it), but they strand people in a foreign country for an additional 24 hours and don't care? We waited 2 years for this vacation and use Southwest exclusively to build up points. We will be cancelling our Southwest credit card and switching to American for all points and flights. Unacceptable."
"""On time, affordable, accommodating""","Not Verified | Atlanta to Houston. Southwest is the best thing to ever happen to airfare. On time, affordable, and accommodating. But above all, their Rapid Rewards program is the best. Easy to earn free flights, and easy to redeem / book for free. We've been flying them for a decade and will never fly anyone else."
"""caring, thoughtful person""","Not Verified | On August 28th, 2018 my family and I were flying back from what was suppose to be an amazing vacation. Unfortunately and unexpectedly, we lost my father while we were on vacation and he was with us. As we boarded our flight, one of the flight attendants recognized us from our departure, and asked if we were down a family member.. We said yes and told our tragic story. After learning of our unfortunate circumstances, Gisela was the most amazing, caring, thoughtful person ever to step into our lives at the very moment we needed her! Offering to help with loose ends and comfort. She was absolutely an angel! Thank you so much Gisela."
"""liked Southwest overall""","Not Verified | I enjoy that the flight attendants bring snacks and drinks around multiple times during my flight from Saint Louis, MO to Sacramento, CA. The flight attendants are welcoming and pleasant. I recently started ordering WIFI. I have ordered WIFI 3 times. 2 times out of 3 the wifi connection is awful and end up not being able to use the wifi I pay for. So I will never pay to use this wifi again. It does not work well. Waste of money. Besides my one complaint l have liked Southwest overall and will continue flying with them."
"""nobody seems to know or care""","Not Verified | Las Vegas to Baltimore via Chicago. Never never again. Our first flight was supposed to be to Midway/Chicago then on to BWI but it was cancelled due to weather. Understandable, not a huge issue. We were given a direct flight to BWI which left Vegas 9 hours later then they rerouted us to Norfolk, left us here for 5 hours then just delayed us another 2 hours!! I have no idea where or luggage is or will be and nobody seems to know or care. Never again will I travel with Southeast and I will make sure nobody I know does either."
"""had the worst experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I had the worst experience with Southwest. They cancelled my 6am flight from New Orleans to Omaha without notifying me. I checked out of my hotel room and got to the airport at 4:15 in the morning to discover my flight had been cancelled. I waited in line for 3 hours to find out the didn’t have a flight until the next morning. I had to book another flight with American Airlines in order to get back home. On top of the terrible service and having to spend 16 hours in an airport, I emailed the airline to see what they could do for me and they refused to do anything for my inconvenience. I will never fly southwest again."
"""Not flying Southwest again""","✅ Trip Verified | Southwest is supposed to be a good airline? That’s an urban myth. They cancelled my direct flight from Vegas to Orlando without apology or explanation, and offered nothing for me losing an entire day after having to rebook a connecting flight later in the day. They wouldn’t even provide me an earlier cattle call position. Not flying Southwest again."
"""really helped me""","Not Verified | Recently my friend and I flew from Kansas City to San Juan, transferring through Baltimore. Coming back we left San Juan to Kansas City, transferring through Tampa. My friend had shoulder surgery less than three months ago, and was still handicapped. She had called ahead of time, as she is not able to walk very far, and the airline (when ask) always had a wheelchair and person to put her on the plane, or take her off, which really helped me, as I was carrying our overhead bags. Since she has long legs, one of the flights she had to sit about 3 rows back, with the seat next to the isle. The bad part of this was that she could not stretch her legs, like if she was on the front row, and the arm rest would not lift up, for her to push herself out. The other 3 flights she was able to sit in front, and the only thing she missed was the tray on the ""newer"" flights that helps hold the snack and drink, where the older air planes do not have this. All the airline personnel, no matter who they were were always helpful on these 4 flights. I am used to using a Kiosk in Kansas City outside, and San Juan only has one inside, and that made it hard, trying to drag all the luggage inside."
"""such a bad experience""","Not Verified | St. Louis to Las Vegas. Booked earliest flight 5.30am depart to 7 am arrival to make it to a brunch and even paid extra night at resort to check in before 3. Received email flight cancelled and rebooked automatically 10.30am to 1.30pm - no phone call for other flight options?! Called representative to ask for earlier flight for both of us .. after 30 minutes was able to make the changes for both of us, I thought. Received an email next day saying I missed my flight and was considered ""a no show"". The phone representative booked the wrong date for 1 of our tickets! I called to complain to representative and they were unable to refund my ticket! I had to purchase a new ticket on my credit card. He referred me to another customer service line, waited 50 minutes on hold before being assisted. Then I was told they would ""try"" to refund me when it was clearly the employees fault! After arguing my case politely and being on additional holds, I was told I would be refunded within 30 days. So my credit card remains double charged for 30 days? 3 hours on the phone and 4 people later on the phone and still waiting for my refun. I have been a loyal Southwest Customer and even referred friends for the Rewards Card; however, this was the worst experience I've encountered. Extremely disappointed. You think they would at least give some sort of voucher for such a bad experience. I had to argue to not have to double pay security fees and tickets."
"""so unbelievably nice to me""","✅ Trip Verified | This review is actually for a flight I will catch tomorrow. Southwest was so unbelievably nice to me just now that I had to do something nice for them. Think about that for a second. A large corporation was so good to me that I searched for a way to show a little gratitude? This is a first for me. I am so used to ATT nickel and diming me every chance they can, and my bank finding new ways to pull more fees out for any slip up on my part, that I thought my money was gone when I realized that I forgot to change my flight to tomorrow. Their policy is that you can change or cancel and get a refund on any flight as long as you do this before your flight takes off. That policy, 2 me, makes SWA the best. Buses and movie houses won't give you a thing if your plans change and they would only be giving you a few dollars. Well this time I forgot to change the flight and thought that they are already being so generous to let customers change their minds for free there is no way they would help me out after I failed to simply do my part. I called and my flight is tomorrow. No charge. Any other airline would have cost another $180. Southwest, you had every right to charge me again, but you didn't. I owe you one."
"""I had not canceled it before""","✅ Trip Verified | Due to the terrible storms that recently took place in Dallas, Texas, I was unable to travel to California for two days. The flights the following days, of course, were full since everyone had rescheduled, and I had to cancel my trip. I was traveling on American Airlines to California first, and then Southwest from Burbank to San Jose Airport. Because I could not get to California in time to catch my Southwest Flight, I had to cancel it. It was canceled two days before I was to leave (April 7 canceled). I then received an email at the time the flight was supposed to take off in Burbank that said I had not canceled the flight and that I would lose all my money because I had not canceled it before the time of departure. The huge storms in Dallas were not my fault, and Southwest should have at least credited my account for a future flight. Nearly all other airlines do this. They refused to do this. I won't be flying them anymore. There service has become increasingly worse during recent years, and there pricing policies (e.g., the business seats scam we all know about) are byzantine."
"""Very disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Grand Rapids to Las Vegas. Very disappointed. First, they cancelled my flight 3 days before leaving. They informed me by automated call that it was cancelled but, I could have my money back. No offer of alternate flights, nothing and, I went through a travel agent! They hung up when we tried to book other flights. Offered nothing in return of losing most of a vacation day. Then, coming home more delays and a “sorry” over the speaker at the airport. How about a ticket, discount, drinks, premium seating? Nothing. Southwest needs to work on customer service!"
"""completely dropped the ball""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Dallas. The issue I have with this airline and the flight experience I had stems from the general lack of communication. Flight planned to leave at 8:04 pm from Atlanta with expected time of arrival to Dallas at 12:35 pm (the plane was to stop briefly in Austin with no projected plan to switch planes). We arrive to Austin and hear over the intercom while in the plane, “This flight will be heading to Chicago so if you are going to Dallas you will have to get off this plane to meet with another plane expected to arrive soon. Sorry for the abrupt change, guys.” Essentially, I was booted off this plane with no email/text update from the airlines. As I get off the plane, everyone from my flight who had plans to fly to Dallas were all confused and lost because no one knew where to go to next/what gate will be the next plane leaving to Dallas - nothing! I have never had service like this with them but I believe today they completely dropped the ball! I wish I had some sort of email/text correspondence that would have alerted me of this change. The original flight had no delays foreseen or anything officially stated to those on the flight. It’s completely inconsiderate to those who need to return for work or need to be home to their children for school the following day when abrupt changes as this with little time to make room for adjustments. Ridiculous!"
"""smooth and on time""","✅ Trip Verified | My fight was 1193 from Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale on March 27, 2019. This was by far the best flight I've had with any airline. The flight staff was very courteous and humorous. They constantly made announcements keeping us informed of everything. Treated us like family and kept us laughing and entertained. The flight was smooth and on time."
"""never use this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Atlanta. Received a text at 12:30 pm informing me that my 2:30 flight was delayed until 5:00 pm. Fine, not a problem. Then, on my way to the airport at 2:30 pm and received another text stating that my flight was now leaving at 3:00 pm. Arrived to the airport to learn that those times are only considered “estimates” and that I should’ve been here at 12:30 in case that changed. Nowhere in my communications from Southwest was I informed of this. Got rebooked for a 9:30 pm flight and since I’m now here 6 hours early I can’t even enter the gate areas. Also this trip was originally to take place a week ago but had to be rescheduled because Southwest cancelled that flight. And this the 2nd time in a row that I have had this flight cancelled. And Dallas is a Southwest hub. I will never use this airline again. Buyer beware."
"""leave them without options""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Oakland. Southwest cancelled our flight going and coming home. Instead of trying to help their customers they just leave them without options. Within minutes every flight was sold out. When they cancelled our flight flying out, I called and the customer service rep said my flight coming home would not be cancelled. It was and I was not able to get another flight for two days which was not possible due to a connecting flight. We had to go with another airline that could accommodate us. It cost allot of extra money and time. Southwest could have cared less. Then when I had to cancel the flight I booked two days later after I asked if I would get a full refund if I could get another flight, they tried to charge me anyway. It is unbelievable the lack of customer service they have provided this trip. I’m not understanding why they couldn’t just get another plane to put all of these customers on and leave them where they are rather than just leave them with nothing to fin for themselves. As of now I am considering never flying with them again and cutting my southwest card up. They never once tried to make the situation better. It’s really sad they are treating their loyal customers this way. You need a better system Southwest when you cancel flights. For me personally, I’m scared to ever book a flight with you again. I was really worried about how my family and I were going to get home at the LAST MINUTE."
"""Southwest service is gone""","Not Verified | Tampa to Kansas City. Southwest service is gone. 5 of last 6 flights wifi not working or intermittent. Have gone from economical with great service to mid range pricing with horrible service. So tragically sad! They're now the Greyhound bus in the sky. Filthy, out of date, sketchy planes."
"""expensive and unreliable""","✅ Trip Verified | Indianapolis to Las Vegas. Very poor reliability. Flights on this airline are delayed in at least half my flights. It used to be reliable and now it is expensive and unreliable. The in air Wi-Fi is the worst I have ever experienced. I will not fly Southwest Airlines anymore."
""" Raising the early bird""","✅ Trip Verified | Raising the early bird to $20/one way p/person ($80 r/t) just put Southwest Airlines in the same category with other airlines that charge for bags, peanuts, oxygen, etc. Therefore my travel search will now include those carriers. Just cant leave well enough alone, can you. Just like all the rest, you always have to have more more more."
"""fly home a day early""","Not Verified | We were notified today that our flight home this Saturday to Chicago was cancelled. I called to get another flight home on Saturday and they were all booked as well as the Sunday’s flight! The only other option was to fly home on Friday, a day early, cutting time off our vacation sucks,, on a 6 hour flight to Chicago getting us home at 9 pm! Then we still have a 3 hour drive home. We are prepaid for our one bedroom condo at the Hilton Grand in Vegas through Saturday so we are out $300 because we have to fly home a day early! I will be spreading the word about this experience as well as my husband!"
"""service was extraordinary""","✅ Trip Verified | I recently flew on Southwest airlines and the flight was delayed by a little more than 3 hours. Despite this being inconvenient it is sometimes unavoidable. Southwest airlines offered vouchers to all passengers for the inconvenience. The flight crew was also very apologetic for the delayed and the service was extraordinary. I have experienced delays in many other carriers and never compensated in anyway. I will fly Southwest airlines whenever possible in the future."
"""professional and courteous""","✅ Trip Verified | Charleston to Midway. Flight was delayed about 5 hours. For everyone’s safety the flight was delayed due to mechanical issue. We were given a “Luv voucher” for more than the cost of the flight. All Southwest staff were very professional and courteous. Thank you to Southwest Airlines."
"""cancel flights routinely""","Not Verified | Denver to Tampa via Atlanta. Southwest has terrible customer service with a poor management of aircraft. They cancel flights routinely with the excuse “inclement weather” and then are unable to rebook you in a timely manner. Mind you other airlines and even other southwest aircraft are departing on time. It’s all good on Southwest if you flight actually leaves, but once your flight is cancelled, good luck trying to get another flight with the next 5 days. You might save on the ticket but in the long run you are out thousands because they have limited ability to accommodate one small problem in flight operations. This has now happened to me twice in a row. Other airlines do a better job of rescheduling you. Southwest leaves you stranded and doesn’t help with the expense of waiting multiple days to get back home."
"""did not have a good experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I just wanted to share my recent experience with Southwest so that people can make informed decisions and know what they are getting themselves into when they book with them. I did not have a good experience with Southwest Airlines. I received an email from Southwest on Wednesday night indicating that my Thursday morning flight back from Boston to Denver had been cancelled due to weather. I had heard from my brother-in-law, who used to fly Southwest frequently, that they had a very strict weather cancellation policy, so out of curiosity, I went to check if all flights into Denver were cancelled, or if Southwest was just falling back on their strict weather cancellation policy. I found that both JetBlue and Spirit flights were still scheduled to arrive in Denver on time, which would lead me to believe that although Denver airport conditions may not have been ideal, they were safe enough for commercial airlines to fly in. Denver International Airport was even indicating that they had 4 of their 6 runways open. I called the number Southwest included in their flight cancellation email to reschedule my flight. After waiting on hold for about 1.5 hours, I was disconnected, so I called them back immediately only to wait on hold for 2 more hours. Once I was finally able to get through to a customer service representative to reschedule my flight, the representative told me that the absolute soonest flight they could get me on was not until Sunday, 4 days later. My husband and I had plans to go up to the mountains for the weekend and flying back into Denver on Sunday would have caused us to miss our entire trip. So I called AMEX Travel, as I had booked through them initially, and they were able to get me on a United flight leaving Saturday…one day earlier than the Southwest flight. At this point I was really wishing I would have booked with JetBlue or Spirit, as now I would be stuck in Boston an additional 3 days that I had not planned for. This means 3 more nights in a hotel, 3 more days of having to purchase food, and 3 more days of missing work. If this wasn’t inconvenient enough, my husband and I were also not going to be able to make our trip to the mountains, which we had already planned. Just for fun, I added up all the costs that stemmed from Southwest cancelling my flight. Hotel: $150/per night x 3 nights = $450 (prices had gone up over the weekend due to the St. Patrick’s Day holiday) Food: about $10/meal x 9 meals = $90 Missed days of work: $22/hr x 24 hrs (3 8 hr workdays) = $528. Total amount lost due to Southwest cancelling my flight because of their “strict weather policy” = $1,068 (this is not including the money that was already spent on our trip to the mountains that we were not able to take). I don’t know many people who can afford to just lose out on that amount of money. Southwest did end up refunding my cancelled flight, which naturally they should, considering they cancelled it. In addition, when I called in to see if they could offer any other kind of compensation, they offered me a $150 Southwest flight voucher. They indicated that because the flight was cancelled due to weather, the cancellation was out of their control and is not their fault. I beg to differ. JetBlue and Spirit did not cancel their flights, so clearly, the cancellation was due to some policy Southwest has that JetBlue and Spirit do not.,"
"""the customer service is terrible""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew to MO from NY for my sons Army graduation. We had booked a return flight from MO to NY on 3/15/19 at 8:15 which was delayed until 10:00 then cancelled. I was told it was due to the weather and I would not receive a refund. After speaking to 3 different people I was finally told our flight was cancelled due to safety issues. My family and I had to purchase different tickets through American Airlines because Southwest told us that they wouldn’t have anything for another 2 days. One of the Southwest representatives said that they would return $311.96 per person, gave me a receipt told me it would return to my credit card within two days which was a lie. I spent over $2000 on a rental car and new tickets in order to get home for work thinking I was getting my money back, as I was told. I will no longer be flying Southwest, the customer service is terrible!"
"""I'm very disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | I had a change of last name that I e-mailed well back in Jan 2019. Upon requesting how to get my last name change, I was not informed that I should also include any upcoming flight reservation numbers. That being said, only my Rapid Rewards profile was updated on the site, nothing else. I didn't know what to make of this by the time I went to fly out. I was allowed to fly with my old married last name with no issues, but was almost left to not be allowed to get on the plane from Austin because my ID didn't match my boarding pass name. This caused me to nearly miss my flight and I rushed to the gate losing 4 items! I've never in my life lost so many items in my life- especially not all at once! I was incredibly flustered. I lost 2 items at Austin, one on a plane going to Nashville, then at the Nashville Airport before boarding my flight back to Chicago. The incorrect last name was Baker instead of Anderson. I called to their Customer Service headquarters to where the best they could do was offer me a voucher of $100. That's not even enough for a free flight (round trip) to anywhere! They seriously don't care about their customers because aside from using this voucher, I will no longer be using their flight services again. I didn't even get a promised drink from Nashville into Chicago. I also landed without a jacket (because this was one of my 4 lost items) and ended up freezing. I've reported my lost items twice! TWICE! Because after you call in to report a claim of a lost item, they insist that you fill out a document of theirs to be submitted via e-mail on top of it. This company makes all sorts of excuses as to why they won't do anything further. They say that they had no idea I had an upcoming flight based on my RR#. I had no idea they even needed it! So, they can't point blame on me. What happened to the ""Customer's always right!"" attitude? I'll be taking my business elsewhere and I recommend everyone else does the same! I get that they are not responsible for lost items; however, I would not have lost any of those items if I hadn't been flustered to missing my plane to begin with- so yes, it is their fault when I've never lost anything at airports in my life! I'm very disappointed in this airline company and I cannot wait to use their voucher to just move on to another airline company."
"""continually lets me down""","✅ Trip Verified | I'd rather fly harnessed to the wing of a JetBlue flight than fly Southwest. Worst airline ever, continually lets me down. Started our trip off with an overcrowded flight where I couldn't rest my arm without bumping into a stranger. This was an international flight by the way, 5 hours. Then on the way back we went from Punta Cana to Chicago, then back to Baltimore. Added at least 3 hours to my travel time. Then when we finally arrived in Baltimore they lost my girlfriends luggage so I had to wait for another flight to land and see if it was there, but it wasn’t. So they had to mail it to me. All they gave me for this was a 100 dollar travel voucher, which I will never be able to use because I don’t plan on using their airline again."
"""never fly Southwest again""","✅ Trip Verified | After being stuck in Denver for 3 days and not email to let us know our flight was canceled to to weather, we finally discovered we had to act fast as the airlines were filling up fast. We were told the soonest a flight home would be is 3 days away. After spending more money and extending out stay, I asked if Southwest Airlines could upgrade our boarding zone to B instead of C as it’s first come first serve, the answer was no. We could purchase upgrade. Both the man on the phone and multiple customer service were unsympathetic towards our situation as we were stranded for 3 days. I’ll never fly Southwest Airlines again."
"""Do not fly with Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Columbus via Orlando. I recently thought I’d try another airline other than Delta and decided to take a chance on Southwest. Flight attendant was making extremely unprofessional comments over the loud speaker. Secondly, On the way there and the way back we didn’t make it on time once. Thought no big deal, delays happen. Called customer service to try and bump flights. Estimated wait time 130 minutes. A company shouldn’t even be allowed to say they have customer service with a 130 minute phone wait time. Do not fly with Southwest."
"""I think I’ve finally had enough""","✅ Trip Verified | Southwest continues to underwhelm. I think I’ve finally had enough. They just cancelled my return flight with no explanation. Literally no code is available to the agent explaining the reason. Clearly it is so they can maximize profits during a busy week of flights. Now, my family of 7 is stranded with no rental cars and no hotels available during spring break week. The next available flight home is 4 days away. What are we to do? Sleep outside? On top of it all, the customer service agent put me on a “brief hold” only to hang up on me because my call to figure out options was taking too long for her. I hate you Southwest. Never again. And I will tell everyone I meet about this experience."
"""treated extremely poorly""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Punta Cana. Hostesses were extremely rude and inconsiderate. Very unprofessional. Wouldn’t recommend flying Southwest if you have an another alternative. Flight itself was fine, but our group was treated extremely poorly."
"""I hate this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Orlando. I hate this airline. This was the first time for me with Southwest and this is the most horrible airline I have travelled with. No professionalism at all. Rude staff. No seats assigned (seriously)! I will not fly Southwest Airlines ever again."
"""the typical Southwest fare""","✅ Trip Verified | There was a slight delay in departure from Dallas to Washington; however this delay was made up in the air. On DAL-DCA leg, the aircraft was 737-800. This aircraft with the new Boeing interior design is brighter with curved overhead bins. Seating is very comfortable with ample leg room. Service was the typical Southwest fare. On the PVD-DAL leg, the aircraft was a 737-700. Again, there was a slight delay. We were fortunate to be seated in the very first row thus we had all the extra leg room. WiFi on both flights was excellent."
"""there was enough leg room""","✅ Trip Verified | Providence to Dallas via Washington DC. Both flights departed on time with no issues in the boarding process and/or during in flight. Service was typical of Southwest. Flight Attendants come around and take your order for drinks and service snacks. Both flights were on B737-700. On the PVD-DCA leg, there was enough leg room to seat in comfort. The same could not be said for the DCA-DAL leg. The seating area felt cramped even though this was the same type of aircraft we flew in on from Providence."
"""forced to walk in pain""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Tampa. I had surgery 6 days prior and had medical documentation stating I was not to lift anything over 2 pounds or walk extended distances. I was not even supposed to fly but I was going to see a specialist on Maryland so the restrictions were put in place and we arranged wheelchair assistance. I had zero issues the flight to BWI. The trip back was an absolute nightmare and completely unacceptable. We landed in Tampa after a turbulent flight which in turn heightened my pain. I was 1 of 5 people that had boarded with wheelchair assistance. When we landed we were advised that the wheelchairs weren't available yet. Fortunately the other 4 people were able to walk off the aircraft without a problem. I advised the stewardess of my restrictions and stated I would wait. Everyone had gotten off and the stewardess asked me to walk off. I again told her I could not. They cleaned the plane a bit and again told me I needed to get off. I did not fight it and advised them I could not lift my bag and they carried it off for me and had me stand in pain in the alleyway and wait with the entire crew. She then said I needed to go so I slowly started walking and walked most the alley way where I was then greeted with a wheelchair. The attendant then took off hitting the bump off the gate. I told him I just had surgery but clearly he was in a hurry. This is absolutely unacceptable. I legitimately needed help and had arranged for assistance on advance with documentation stating my restrictions. If there weren't any wheelchairs available I should not have been forced to walk in pain when I was advised by a medical professional otherwise. I had physical proof with me and this trip was not made by choice. I called and filed a complaint with customer service and was advised I would get a response within 10 days. This is unacceptable! My husband and I have always flown Southwest and never had an issue."
"""Need more crews like them""","Not Verified | Salt Lake City to to Bradley via Chicago. All male flight attendant crew - In this day and age it was nice to see a whole male flight attendant crew on the aircraft. They were all professional and very nice especially the lead. With southwest's mission being based and rooted upon great personality they have met that expectation and more. Even with a difficult passenger a few rows in front of me complaining about a simple task of putting his belongings under the seat the lead still remained pleasant and professional. Shout out to the crew for their hard work and positive work ethic! Need more crews like them."
"""flight to Houston is cancelled""","Not Verified | Thursday 2/21/19 receive an alert on my app my flight to Houston is cancelled. No reason given. The flight had a stop and plane Change in Las Vegas. I have a seminar that I cannot miss I spend an hour on hold and an hour online trying to rebook with Southwest no luck book with Spirit airlines. I find the contact link to SWA and send a message cancel my return trip also stating I cannot wait to book a flight and I have one on another airlines. One hour later I receive a call from SWA can we work something out. No I have already booked a new flight cancel and refund my money. Today I check my e-mail and I have a no reply answer from them. It states the flight was cancelled for inclement weather. Las Vegas received an inch of snow on Thursday. I lived in Vegas for 30 years and in 2008 the airport received 8” of snow and they did not cancel flights. Then I get a CNN news alert that SWA is cancelling flights all over because of a mechanics negotiations that has gone on for two years. It appears that most flights in or out of Las Vegas are cancelling."
"""save as many seats as you need""","Not Verified | Milwaukee to Denver. Boarding process - check in to get boarding location to discover passengers are allowed to board and save seats for people that have a later boarding assignment. Will not fly this airline again, but people need to know that according to their customer service department - saving seats is allowed. If you fly this airline - have one person purchase early bird or business class and have that person board and save as many seats as you need for the people in your party."
"""very bad customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Dallas via Chicago. I had flight on Feb 23 early morning at 7:40 Am initially from MSP to Dallas. There was no snow but they still cancelled the flight. Rescheduled to 10:30 am, they just cancelled again. For next day feb 24 I rescheduled to flight for early morning 7am, it got cancelled again. Rescheduled to 10:15 Am flight later it also got cancelled. To be frank I guess they don’t have enough people to fly in their flight so they just cancelled flight by saying weather conditions. Because I have all my friends traveled on both days without any problem since there is no snow. It has very bad customer service. I would not recommend them for my future travel"
"""canceled our Flight""","Not Verified | Chicago to St Louis. Southwest canceled our Flight at 10 pm the night before our trip. The weather was not the reason since their other flights flew. We were given a phone number to call. There was a 105 minute wait to reschedule. Since most flights on this route are close to or totally fully booked we returned by train. Since the last 3 trips on this route have had 3 hour delays twice and a 1 hour 20 minute delay once, we will fly other airlines. This is the second time in 3 years a flight was canceled."
"""declined in service""","✅ Trip Verified | Southwest used to be a decent airline, but has recently declined in service. We took our 6 year old daughter to Disney. Our return flight was canceled without notification. To make matters worse, when I asked the attendant at the gate, I was told it was because of “weather”. Being skeptical of this “weather” related issue, I called Southwest customer service number and was told the real answer which was the the flight was canceled due to maintenance issues. So not only was I not informed of the cancellation, they lied to me at the gate. This is not the first time this has happened; last time I was on business. This is my last trip on Southwest. Unacceptable! Especially when you’re traveling with a child. Southwest, Get your act together!"
"""Our flight was cancelled""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Oklahoma City. Our flight was cancelled and I did not get an email until right before I was checking luggage. Others got an email the day before. Then we booked another flight late that night to get a cancellation 5 minutes making the reservations. They didn't have any flights back to Tulsa until 2 days later. I had to fly into OKC and drive the rest of the way. The line was so long I got out after standing in the same spot for 40 minutes. I didn't get anything for this trouble."
"""Extremely late leaving""","✅ Trip Verified | Tampa to Atlanta. Terrible airline. Late getting to Atlanta. Extremely late leaving Atlanta. Fight to Atlanta there air cart broke. Which I’m sure the reason they even need an air cart is because they have terrible maintenance. This is a 24 hr 365 operation. T"
"""Staff unhelpful and inefficient""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to New Orleans. My originally flight from Oakland to LAX with connection flight LAX to MSY was postponed due to mechanical windshield wiper motor error. Our flight was changed 3 times with the best option staying with original flight and hoping plane would be fixed. After 4 hours we finally flew to LAX where we had to wait in baggage claim for 3 hours and argue to get a hotel (reminder that we missed our connection flight home due to southwest equipment malfunction). Southwest gave us a voucher for travel to and from hotel but second voucher could not be plugged into app as payment. Staffs response was “I don’t know how to help you.” Staff was unhelpful and inefficient having to contact supervisor for hotel then travel arrangements to and from hotel. We had NO direct contact or conversation with the manager. Once we arrived to the hotel which was 30 minutes away from the airport, the service desk attendant told us they never received a call from southwest and hopefully she could find us a room. We decided to Uber back to LAX and payed on our expense due to voucher not working. Get to southwest for 7am flight after 3 hours of sleep due to inefficiency of staff and wasting our time trying to figure out processes which should already be in place. Flight from LAX to MSY was delayed yet again 2 hours due to mechanical errors. I asked the desk attendant if I could have more specifics to document for work and the response I received was “I don’t know anything further” and when I asked if there will be an announcement as to why flight was delayed the response I got was “no we are inspecting the plane and when it is safe to fly then we will notify you”. Awaiting flight in airport which total hours spent is 15+ hours and counting for this one flight on my birthday."
"""never received baggage claim""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to Sacramento. Well this is the second time in a row this has happen with southwest. I and my husband are active military and never received baggage claim. We have important places we need to be at a certain time and don’t have time to wait days without our military belongings. This is ridiculous. They’re service wasn’t great. They didn’t seem to care of the situations we had come across. This is a disaster. Don’t think I’ll ever travel with them again."
"""don't upgrade to early bird check in""","Not Verified | Raleigh to Denver. Huge fan of Southwest. I will use them whenever possible over any other airline. However, not a huge fan of the ""early-bird check-in"" feature. The past 2 times I purchased it, it did not work. Did not check me in and gave me a much lower boarding number. The first time I caught it close enough and was able to get B1 but when I brought it up to customer service at the gate they just kinda shrugged and said ""that's weird, it shouldn't have sold it to you when we didn't have any more available"" and that was it. No apology, no refund offer, no anything. The second time, even though I'd paid for early bird, I made sure I was prepared to check myself in just in case. Glad I did. It didn't work again. I checked myself in and again brought it up to the gate agent and customer service - again, just a shrug and ""weird"". No apology. No refund offer. Nothing. It's very confusing to me, because Southwest has amazing customer service in all other avenues in my experience. But with early bird check in, they just don't care if it works or not. It's an additional $15 per person in my party that they pocketed. So, now I continue to use Southwest, but I don't upgrade to the early bird check in. It's not worth it when it's unreliable."
"""an amazing experience""","Not Verified | Buffalo to Phoenix. I had an amazing experience with Southwest on February 2,2019. Due to a reversal of departure time, I arrived at the airport stressed and late. The staff was amazing. The ticket agent checked my luggage quickly with a late check in tag. I was doubtful it would make the flight. I raced to the gate and the gate agent was wonderful and so helpful. She assured me my luggage would arrive - and she was right. My luggage and I both arrived in Phoenix together and on time. Fabulous experience with Southwest."
"""we're declined seating""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Phoenix. What is the point of Southwest being open seating if people are savings seats for those who didn't check in on time. My husband and I were in the A group and we're declined seating by multiple parties until there was companioned seating on the back half of the plane. Pretty ridiculous. This service gets a 0 for me as when I told the flight attendant, nothing was done."
"""I love Southwest""","Not Verified | Phoenix to Michigan. I love Southwest, my daughter and I made Phoenix our home November of 2016 and we both have flown different airlines back and forth. She sometimes travel alone as a unaccompanied minor and no airline gave her such a great experience on her flight. Thank you Southwest and a special thank you to the pilot. She was excited to sit in the cockpit."
"""not use Southwest Airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | Portland to Los Angeles. Southwest Airlines cancelled my direct flight due to ""Maintenance"" or ""Weather Issues"" (Employees did not have the same reason) then I'm forced to choose a connecting flight with a 3 hour layover. In addition, my replacement flights got delayed causing me hours of my own life?! I hope everyone reads this and let this be a lesson to not use Southwest Airlines."
"""does not include a guitar""","✅ Trip Verified | Ontario to Oakland. The website does not make it immediately clear that 2 free bags checked does not include a guitar. That's annoying. Financially, this flight was a bad decision, and has made me decide I won't fly southwest again."
"""definitely fly Southwest again""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Louisville. Zero problems. Great service there and back. Seats are not luxurious but ok. Plane was a newer one and nice. Paid extra to get front row seat but it was worth it. WIFI worked good even though it cost extra. Would definitely fly Southwest again."
"""canned email response""","✅ Trip Verified | Hartford to Tampa. The fact that we were significantly delayed tonight by 2 hr. 40 min. isn't even the motivation behind this review. It's not even the constant WiFi problems we experience every single flight. The main reason is Southwest's lack of heart. I was A-List Preferred and have flown SW exclusively for a few years now. I was three flights short in 2018 to maintain my A-List Preferred status, and I emailed them explaining that the reason I was short was because I was forced to fly Delta a few times due to Southwest cancelling or delaying the flights in question. It was such a light-hearted plea, too. I thought surely in the name of customer experience, they'll understand and appreciate the fact that I'm loyal to them still and they'll do the right thing. Not so much, unfortunately. Instead, I get this canned email response below. ""We received your email and appreciate your taking the time to contact us. As a valued Customer of Southwest Airlines, your feedback is very important to us, and we welcome the opportunity to respond. A-List and A-List Preferred status provides lucrative benefits to recognize and reward our most loyal Customers, and we must rely on our Rapid Rewards Members to gain entry to these tier levels through their activity in the program. I truly understand your frustration given that you were only three flights shy of qualifying for A-List Preferred. In order to maintain the integrity of our Rapid Rewards program and continue to provide the perks associated with each tier status, we must consistently adhere to the program rules. Saying “no” to a request for tier status that has not been truly earned helps ensure that we are able to say “yes” to offering benefits to our qualifying Members in the future. Your patronage and loyalty has not gone unnoticed. It's our hope that you will continue flying Southwest Airlines as it would be our privilege to welcome you onboard for many years to come.

"""Everyone working was amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Chicago. I have horrible anxiety and gets worse when I need to fly. I am a person that believe my feet belong on the ground. Well I had to take a business trip solo and never flown alone. I saw the pilot coming from grabbing some lunch so I approached him to see if he was flying the plane or going home. If he was going home I was going to ask to sit next to him to help with my fears. He was the flying pilot. He asked me if everything was ok and I told him I was very scared and nervous. He told me it was going to be ok and a smooth short ride. I thanked him for the conversation and went to wait in line to board. Well a few mins into waiting a wonderful man came and said to come with him. They allowed me on the plane and introduced me to everyone working on the plane. The wonderful gentlemen told me to pick any seat and he would sit next to me and guide me through the sounds and bumps so I know I’m safe. Everyone working on flight 1599 was so amazing. I wish I knew each and everyone name working that day to call and tell their bosses how much I appreciate everything they did to help me feel better. Thank you so much Southwest Airlines. You all are amazing and I hope your bosses know this. I cannot thank you enough for taking the extra time to help me."
"""worst airline I’ve flown""","✅ Trip Verified | Oakland to Las Vegas. It’s the worst airline I’ve flown. I’ve only departed on time approximately 50 percent of the time. Alaska is better. Only gave it a zero because there’s not a lower choice"
"""a consummate professional""","✅ Trip Verified | Indianapolis to Ft Myers. From the beginning of the flight to the end, our stewardess, Deborah was a consummate professional. There was a screaming baby, people were not loading with consideration of others in mind, but Deborah took it all in stride. Her beaming smile and wonderful compassion to this harried new parent was a refreshing change to those of us used to being just 'another number' in the airline industry. If Southwest keeps employing stellar employees like Deborah, I will no longer even search out the competition. Quality beats any of the other items that I could possibly consider. Thank you again, Deborah."
"""sit on tarmac for an hour""","✅ Trip Verified | Sacramento to San Diego. On the flight out, the plane pulled away from the gate on time, only to sit on the tarmac for an hour so they could complete a repair. But of course, this was considered an ""on time departure"". On the return flight, the captain informed us that something was dropped under the captains chair, and they had to remove the chair and an access panel to retrieve it. I kid you not. After 45 minutes the captain came out of the cockpit, picked up the intercom, and with a grin on his face, showed the entire passenger area the item that was retrieved, a cupholder. Just great. I feel so confident flying with Southwest."
"""handled the problem well""","Not Verified | Our plane from Baltimore Washington to Aruba had some minor mechanical issues forcing us to divert to San Juan instead of flying directly on to Aruba. There was another plane waiting for us in San Juan and we were able to make it to Aruba 3 hours late which was great considering the diversion. The best part of the story is a few hours later we received a voucher each for $150 from SWA for the delay. Considering we used points and my wife flew on a companion fare(free) it cost me nothing for the flight. SWA handled the problem well and we arrived only three hours behind schedule when it could have been a much longer delay. They were so smart with sending out vouchers to all of us in a timely manner."
"""No organization at all""","Not Verified | Tucson to Kansas City. Never again Southwest doesn't take care of problems. Flight had mechanical issue. Not a problem. Once we had to get off. Only 2 employees to help reroute 150 some of passengers. Once I got a confirmation on new flight from text, they couldn't give me a boarding pass. Finally got new part several hrs later. We boarded again. It took to long on run way. I missed any other flight. Got rebooked again. 6 hrs later I get to KC. No luggage! Now I'm mad. It was a joke flying with Southwest. No organization at all."
"""I feel ripped off""","✅ Trip Verified | On December 26, 2018 I flew my daughter back to California from Phoenix. Her luggage that was checked in was opened and checked by Homeland Security. We did not know the suitcase was checked until the next day in the afternoon. My daughter and I decided to put her Christmas gift cards; PlayStation, Ross, and Burlington, in the selfie light box that she got for Christmas as well thinking they would be safe. Not the case! When my daughter open the selfie light box to retrieve her gift cards because her mother was taking her shopping that day she discovered that the Burlington gift card had been stolen. What a disappointment. My daughter is 14 years old and this was her first experience flying and this is the treatment she received from a dishonest employee. I contacted Southwest and they sent me an email stating that the missing item, my daughter's Burlington gift card is not covered. I feel ripped off and appalled that Southwest does not take responsibility for such misconduct."
"""experienced excellent service""","✅ Trip Verified | Long Island to Baltimore. I have always experienced excellent service from Southwest Airlines except in the area of TSA. The TSA constantly reminds me that it is not their fault that pre-check is not open or in Albany's case, pre-check has no body scanner for pre-check. I know SW is not responsible for TSA agents but since they have not sent me the usual evaluation form, here I am. I met my 1st obnoxious agent ever on 12/27 at 9:45 am at ISP. I asked why pre-check was not open and he yelled at me that it was not his fault. It was SW's. Since I had packed for pre-check screening, it took me a little time to locate liquids. He badgered me the entire time, with a loud voice. At one point he asked the woman behind me if she was his witness. She asked for what and he shut up. The woman who did the extensive pat-down was excellent! And how about this? At BWI my luggage was on the carousel before I arrived there!"
"""amazing flight attendants""","✅ Trip Verified | Flight 3063 had fabulous flight on 12/30 from Orlando to Baltimore thanks to amazing flight attendants. They were both very kind and friendly. Made holiday travel a very nice experience. My thanks and kudos to both gentlemen. Awesome team."
"""No interest in helping""","✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to Sacramento. No interest in helping passengers. They create arbitrary timelines regarding departure time and announcements, with no real structure. Their ability to brush off all customer concerns and ""pass off"" customers to avoid problems overshadows the prices for flights. They are cheap for a reason. Consistently stuck on planes waiting for passengers on one flight, and on the next they turn multiple people away. They state they do hard paperwork for the pilot before each flight, which must be untrue if they pilot comes walking on 5 minutes before departure. Another example of an airline that overbooks passengers. When asked about the status of my luggage, I was informed of a new ""system"" to check luggage. The employee stated she could not see where my luggage went due to the new system. This is a joke Southwest. It is so easy to be an honest and compassionate company, yet you challenge yourself daily by treating customers (the ones that buy the tickets) like second class citizens. I will not be flying Southwest and have since been using Alaska airlines, with no problems."
"""not interested in helping me""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Dallas via Houston. I have been contacting Southwest Airlines to get my check-in bags which was sent from Boston to Dallas. They canceled my flight my connecting flights initially and I was stuck in Houston for hours asking for another flight before I was given another flight to Dallas which got a layover of 7 hours in Oklahoma City. When I reached Dallas, they have no idea where my checked-in bags are. Tried contacting baggage claim office. They were not interested in helping me. Tried contacting customer care. They couldn't help either. Tried contacting baggage office last 24 hours multiple times, but no answer. I am stuck in this city with no clothes and I have to leave from here tomorrow. Now they have ruined my trip and my new agenda for today is to take an Uber and go to the airport which is 20 miles away and check with them if my bags have reached."
"""stranded me at 2 different airports""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been trying to get home for the last 36 hours. Weather delayed my flight at first (which is obviously not their fault) but then the aircraft landed us in a different state, kicked us off, left our luggage and left us. I was then thrown onto a random flight that wouldn’t even be getting me home. I arrived in the middle of the night and they gave me no ticket to even get home. After I went to the counter to get a new flight home it would be another 18 hours before I could board. My luggage was left behind in the other state because of their sloppy work of throwing me onto a different flight at random and I have no clue when I will be getting it. My father is now driving 4 hours to pick me up because Southwest has stranded me at 2 different airports and gave out no hotel vouchers. Therefore I have been in airport chairs for the last 16 hours and I have 13 more to go. Bless my dad for stepping up!!"
"""never fly Southwest Airlines again""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Cleveland. I will never fly Southwest Airlines again. You get up early to check in so you may have the luxury of choosing a seat and if you're traveling with loved ones being able to sit next to them. Well my partner and I got a B boarding pass 35 + 36. When we finally get to board we see these personal items of somebody's placed on two rows of seating. When my fiance and I go to sit down we are told those seats are being saved for someone else's family members. Obviously those family members did not get up to get a higher boarding number. When I asked the stewardess if that was allowed the stewardess replied we don't regulate the seating. Needless to say my fiance and I we're separated during a very long flight. Also we ordered drinks and the stewardesses sat in the back giggling and laughing with each other rather than doing their job we didn't get our drinks until we had to ask them not once but twice. I have been a faithful Southwest customer so has my mother two sisters aunt and many cousins I have told my whole family about my experience and we all agree to never fly Southwest again. Next time I need to fly I will pay the extra money and Fly Frontier Airlines that way I'll pay an extra couple of bucks but at least I know I'll be sitting with the person I'm traveling with and where I want to. Southwest Airlines you've got a lot of cleaning up to do and until then you just lost a lot of business from my family"
""" not worth the money to pay extra""","✅ Trip Verified | Tulsa to Houston via Dallas. I pay extra for Business class every time to board first. Southwest boards all the pre-boarding first and places them all in the front rows. It’s not worth the money to pay extra! Fly American where you know what seat you will be in. It’s absolutely a rip off to pay the extra when the first 4 to 6 rows are already filled up when you get on. Then they try to give you one free drink if you will move seats. Not trying to be an asshole, but the people who preboard don’t pay extra. It’s ridiculous to pay extra when you get nothing from it. I fly at least twice a month and now I know why I don’t fly with them very often."
"""Never again will I fly Southwest""","Not Verified | Baltimore to Los Angeles. Traveled with 17 month old daughter and husband. We got a red eye flight. Daughter was not having it and started screaming crying for about half the fight. One flight attendant in particular kept questioning me if this was our first time flying and why my daughter was acting up. I told her she’s 17 months old to which she replied “In my 20 years of experience experience, I’ve traveled with a lot of toddlers.” Made me feel as if something was wrong with my daughter or me being a bad mother. Never again will I fly with Southwest. I’ve heard bad experiences from family and friends that traveled with Southwest, but now that I have experienced it myself, I’ve had enough."
"""fly Delta next time""","Not Verified | Orlando to Nashville. I arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to my boarding time. Once I checked in I was notified that my flight was delayed. No big deal. Then it was delayed 3 more times. Then it was canceled. I understand that it was raining when I arrived at the airport, but according to the radar there was no serious weather conditions at my current location nor at my destination. Other Southwest planes were leaving left and right. I tried calling customer service, but was put on hold and never got in touch with a real agent. Everything was automated. I’ll fly Delta next time."
"""retrain your staff""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Philadelphia. This is our first time flying with the SouthWest airlines, but I wasn't happy coming back from Orlando,FL - Philadelphia,PA. Check in staff told us that we can board as a family of 5 together. But boarding staff was rude and unpleasant not letting us in, because apparently SouthWest has policy that family can board together only with kids 6 and under. I have a 10y.o.kid and we were scalded and shouted on us many times in front the other people that we just would like to cut the line with small children. She didn't had any rights to humiliate me and my family like this. It wasn't handled this situation intelligent way at all. After this we were seated the last ones on the airplane and basically all of the seats were taken. Our family was scattered all over the airplane, because South West have open seated option. I was surprised that they found two seats for me and my 10 yo.son. I'm not sure what the management thought by this decision, but many families on the airplane was unhappy. I would recommend changing it. People didn't wanted to switch the seats and everybody felt like imprisoned for a couple of hours. I'm happy that it was 2h 25min. flight and never buying cheap tickets anymore from this airline. You should change a lot in your policies and retrain your staff how to handle conflict situations with customers."
"""attendants were so amazing""","✅ Trip Verified | I just got off flight 9 to San Diego from Austin and the three flight attendants were so amazing. My 18 month old daughter was very fussy and not wanting to sleep and the three flight attendants were quick to help! The FA's offered to walk her up and down the plane for me, made sure we had plenty of juice, and kept us supplied with crackers and even made a makeshift baby rattle for her!!Hands down the best service I’ve ever received during a flight. Normally I would’ve felt embarrassed or judged but they didn’t. I will definitely be only flying southwest from now on!"
"""amazing customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Washington to Orlando. Flying Southwest was affordable, amazing customer service, very easy check-in, and TSA preferred is delightful. If Southwest is flying to my destination, it’s my first choice."
"""extremely disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Oakland to Las Vegas. It was over an hour late it took forever to board and then once it boarded we proceeded to sit at the gate for 30 minutes because of a missing bag from another flight. I am extremely disappointed, I’m still sitting here at the gate this very moment. Will think long and hard before I fly Southwest again."
"""would not recommend""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft Lauderdale to San Jose. No mobile boarding passes. Had to wait in line for a boarding pass like it was still the 20th century. Made me check in 36 hours in advance since a purchase extra benefits whereas with any other airline I would just be given a seat next to my girlfriend was not able to take a 3rd luggage and no overweight and I offer to paid I end up leaving so many gifts behind for family that I have not seen in long time. Wifi on flight was good and reasonably priced. Overall would not recommend."
"""never fly this airline again""","Not Verified | This airline is terrible, I had a flight from Nashville to Jacksonville with a layover in Atlanta to switch planes. On both flights the southwest employees had us board the plane only to make us sit at the terminal because something was broken on the plane. I don't know if the maintenance staff with Southwest is the worst of all airlines or they buy the cheapest planes, but it's ridiculous. I will never fly this airline again, I don't care how cheap the flights are."
"""Very poor customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Detroit. Staff on this flight was rude. Captain talking down about competitor on overhead. Attendants were unprofessional and seemed unhappy. Seats are tight, price was too high for being uncomfortable 3 hours and 11 minutes. I will try my best never to use this airline again. We were told the WiFi wasn't working. Very poor customer service."
"""the rudest people ever""","Not Verified | Providence to Tampa. I arrived at the airport today after speaking with the pet policy department 3 times. I was assured that my new puppy would be able to travel in a pet approved carrier and as long as he was less than 25lbs. When I got to the counter he was denied travel because they he was too big, he is a Bernese Mountain puppy I had documentation showing he weighed 16 lbs! I am a rewards member and was a frequent flyer on Southwest, needless to say our Christmas is ruined and I won’t be flying them anytime soon. Rhode Island staff are incredibly the rudest people ever and I can’t even begin to tell you how angry I am. T"
"""experience was wonderful""","✅ Trip Verified | Cleveland to San Antonio. So I was on my way to Lackland Air Force Base to see my nephew graduate I decided to schedule the flight with Southwest. The experience was wonderful. I like the fact that they acknowledge veterans on the flights that’s hard to come by these days. I booked the flights directly through Southwest using their app on my phone. We flew out of Cleveland to Atlanta then to San Antonio. The return flight was from San Antonio to Baltimore then to Cleveland."
"""the staff are unpleasant""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew San Diego to Phoenix. Every time I have flown SouthWest the flight is almost always delayed and the staff are unpleasant. It’s good if you are on a budget but overall the whole flight experience is stressful and plan ahead for a late flight. When I asked why the flight was late apparently the staff weren't even there?"
"""would not recommend""","Not Verified | No mobile boarding passes. Had to wait in line for a boarding pass like it was still the 20th century. Made me check in 24 hours in advance whereas with any other airline I would just be given a seat next to my girlfriend. Wifi on flight was good and reasonably priced. Overall would not recommend."
"""cannot sit in the exit row""","✅ Trip Verified | El Paso to San Antonio. So if you ask for assistance lifting your bag over your head you cannot sit in the emergency exit row. I am a law student and figured I’d add the heavy books to my luggage over the backpack. Well I should have checked my bag because when I asked for a boost to push the bag in the flight attendant first said she had a hurt shoulder and couldn’t do much to assist. She gave it a light push. Then when the bag was up she said if I couldn’t lift my bag over my head I couldn’t sit in the emergency exit row. The 70 year old man with the tiny bag could, but I could not. The elderly couple (the wife could not lift her own bag but her husband lifted it for her) could sit in the emergency exit row. Last time I sat in that row a former pilot assisted me in putting up my bag and did not flag down a flight attendant or even mention that if I could not lift my bag I can’t sit there. The flight attendant could not lift my bag, yet she is still able to work and presumably can open the door. Further, the guests in the emergency exit row were drinking cocktails. Intoxication seems to render them fit. I have already addressed this issue with Southwest on Twitter and they do not seem to care. I lifted my bag from the overhead bin myself and made a mental note to not ask for help/check my bag in the future so my 6 ft tall stature can sit comfortably in the future. This is merely a warning to future customers."
"""extremely unprofessional""","✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Indianapolis to Dallas for four days, for a family Thanksgiving. My bag never made it on the flight. Upon arriving to Dallas, we immediately filed for a lost bag. They located the bag and said they would deliver it. I had to wait two days before my bag got there, which was half of my vacation. The compensation for the inconvenience we got was the bag delivery itself. That is down right ridiculous. I had to buy clothes and bathroom supplies for Southwest Airlines mistake. This was extremely unprofessional and I will probably never fly Southwest Airlines again."
"""very disappointed with them""","✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline I’ve ever had. The only reason I used Southwest was because they were definitely cheaper than other airlines, however I am very disappointed with them. I fly at least once a month with them and every single time, there is a delay with the plane and not just a short delay."
"""big shout out to Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | I am so thankful to be coming home this week to work at Corporate, and to spend Thanksgiving with family and friends. A big shout out to Southwest as I booked my ticket in reverse from Columbus to Tampa leaving today except I’m in Tampa! They were able to get me home today still on the next direct flight and fixed my ticket for the following Tuesday. They even let me keep my incredible price of $199.96 round trip. This is why I fly Southwest regularly. It pays to be a loyal flyer!"
"""most terrible airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Chicago. This is the last time I get screwed by this airline. I will never buy a ticket from this airline again. Flight was supposed to leave at 2.35pm it's 4pm and still waiting. This is by far the most terrible airline service."
"""continue to get my business""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh to Orlando. Nothing bad, service-wise, to say about my trip (RDU-MCO-RDU). The outbound flight was delayed five minutes coming from Phoenix but had 25 empty seats and let customers spread out. Arrived in Orlando on time. Inbound flight back to Raleigh was packed full and arrived 10 minutes early. Service was friendly both ways. Southwest Airlines will continue to get my business for future trips."
"""flight delayed multiple times""","✅ Trip Verified | Oklahoma City to Chicago. My flight was delayed multiple times and their customer service sucks . The staff needs better training as they do not know what they are talking about. It took the 5th rep to be able to tell me the true answer to my issue after being told and promised something different. They do not honor what they say. Make sure you get it in writing because all you will get is a ""I'm sorry this is policy. We will address this internally."" I wasted 4 hours on the phone with them."
"""a scam and don’t bother with it""","✅ Trip Verified | Tampa to Los Angeles via Denver. Just beware of Southwest Airlines “Business select”. When you use the word “Business” in relation to air travel, it usually means: a wider seat, more legroom, better meal service, prioritised baggage and lounge access. If you tick the box and pay for this so called upgrade you get none of those things. Fair enough, you have some fare flexibility and the bags go free. Apart from that and a free drink coupon, you get an economy seat and economy treatment. You get to board early. And, it cost me a lot of money, a few hundred dollars for this so called upgrade - you could say that I should have taken the time to read the fine print, but I made the error of thinking that Business meant Business. My advice - it’s a scam and don’t bother with it."
"""non-professional crew""","✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Portland. My flight got delayed a lot and I tried to catch an early one. I was first on the waiting list, A class. Luckily they had one empty seat so I was prepared to go to the door when a very SW employee flirting around with the male passengers told me that there is somebody else in front of me, specifically her latest flirt. Normally I would have not care much since it was a long shot to get on an early flight but her indolence made me fight for my seat. Her supervisor came, of course said it's me who is supposed to be in the plane and that she will try to make it right. The captain came and help with one more seat. Their help was much appreciated but for me this was last time flying with SW. Too many delays, non-professional crew and higher price compared with the other airlines without any comfort for the money. This happened on 11/09/18 flight 2199 from SJC to PDX (the delayed flight was 0107)."
"""doesn't scan bag tags""","✅ Trip Verified | Richmond to Phoenix via Atlanta. They lost my bag on veterans day. What a nice way to say thanks to an OEF and OIF veteran. What really annoyed me and spurned this review was finding out that this airline doesn't scan bag tags at loading/unloading and track bag movement like the other airlines. How can this not be integrated into a major us airlines technology infrastructure in 2018? Unacceptable. Furthermore, Southwest refuses to admit that the bag was lost and is instead just ""delayed."" Garbage. When I asked the agent where the bag was, she couldn't tell me (since they don't track). I then asked her what you call it when you don't know where something is. Her answer? Lost. I needed what was in the bag to prep for a business meeting on Monday which I am now unable to do."
"""absolutely terrible""","Not Verified | Puerto Vallarta to Houston via Dallas. It's not so hard to understand that delays happen, but we have had more than one delay trying to get from Puerto Vallarta to Dallas, and the workers are absolutely terrible about keeping customers up to date on what's going on."
"""last 12 Southwest flights delayed""","Not Verified | Originally going from Grand Rapids to Birmingham, through Chicago Midway. The GR flight was delayed 3 hours so I would miss my connection. I asked customer service if I could drive to midway and catch the connection. They said no that was not possible to do, but would rebook me on a different flight. I drove to midway for the rebooked flight to find that it too was delayed by more than 3 hrs and would miss my connection in Tampa. So they rebooked me on the second leg of the original flight (the one customer service said was not possible to get on). Sat at Chicago Midway for 3.5 hrs only to find that this flight too was now delayed 2.5 hours. None of these delays were due to weather by the way. I have now had 10 of my last 12 Southwest flights delayed. Shame on me for continuing to use this sub par airline. I guess I’m a glutton for punishment."
"""Horrible service""","Not Verified | Tampa to Nashville . I tried to check-in 24 hours early to get a good seating position. No checking button, but there was an early bird option. I clicked and paid. It said I would be checked in early, but didn't see any boarding info. I kept refreshing screen to see if it would give a check-in button. Finally, about 5 min after the 24 hour advance period, it gave me the checkin button and I checked in. Now have position B44. I have never had B44 when checking in right at the 24 hr mark. This was because the screen didn't give me the button. SW is obviously giving preference to other people and delaying the checkin button for others. Horrible service. Like traveling in a semi trailer full of cattle when you can't check in early. I called and they said that the early bird check-in button checked me in early for the return flight, not the 1st flight. Horrible user experience. Absolutely the worst. In the future I will fly a real airline that actually allows you to have better than a middle seat."
"""disgusted with the lack of help""","✅ Trip Verified | Grand Rapids to San Antonio via Chicago. I have been flying Southwest for years and have been very happy with the airline and Rewards program until this last trip. I checked in my daughter and I 24 hours in advance and it asked me to check a box by each name, obviously can check in a person 1 at a time. That afternoon something happened and my daughter could no longer go. I got on line and went to cancellations. It asked for the passenger name and confirmation number. I put in my daughters name and was able to cancel her flight. Fast forward about 12 hours later and I arrive for my flight at 530am eastern standard time. I was told that my flight had also been cancelled, even though I only ever entered my daughters name. They were able to re-book me, but I had paid 51,000 points for 2 tickets and they re-booked me for 1 ticket at 59,000 points. I called customer service and they could not help. I called customer relations and I was told if I had called them before I re-booked they would have helped. However, they were not even open for business until 7am CST, 2.5 hours after i had to get on a plane. I am thoroughly disgusted with the lack of help and the fact that both flights were cancelled when only 1 name was entered."
"""crew are unbelievable""","✅ Trip Verified | I have flown with Southwest several times, including my very first flight back in December 2017. It was also my 8 year old son’s first flight from STL to Denver and we were all so nervous. It was an extremely early flight, 5:30am departure. When we first boarded, the pilot was standing in the aisle and introduced himself to my son. We told them it was our very first flight ever and he could see that my son was in tears. After introducing himself he told my son that he will safely get us there and will make sure it’s a wonderful flight so he will love flying, so do not worry about a thing, and even showed my son the cockpit area, it made his day, week, year. They also gave him a little airplane sticker pin. We hit a little bit of turbulence on the way however the pilot told us every single time prior to possibly hitting it and even explained why and that it was perfectly safe and how long the turbulence might last. It made us all so comfortable. I have flown at least 20 flights just since then and have yet to have a bad experience with Southwest. Their crew are unbelievable, always going above and beyond for us. My son has flown two more times and looks forward to it every time, gets super excited to meet “his pilots” as he says. And they always shake his hand. We will always fly Southwest."
"""how rude the service was""","✅ Trip Verified | Tucson to Sacramento. Flight attendants were super rude. They were not friendly or welcoming what so ever. One lady in particular was extremely rude on this flight. I am never flying Southewest again after how rude the service was!"
"""I am so grateful for him""","✅ Trip Verified | Oakland to San Diego. I missed my flight and Robert from Southwest San Diego helped me get to my destination. He issued me a standby ticket, but later as I was waiting outside for a ride back home, he found me and handed me an actual ticket. He helped me during this difficult time and I am so grateful for him."
"""awesome crew and pilots""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Colombus. Today when I was flying on flight 1490 I had the best time because of an awesome crew and pilots. There was one individual who made the flight very enjoyable, a flight attendant on this flight. He could not have been more awesome or more funny. Loved having him as a flight attendant"
"""delayed for over two hours""","✅ Trip Verified | Sacramento to Houston via Los Angeles. This airline had me and 50+ passengers delayed for over two hours due to mechanical issues. Don't you think you should get all of us paying passengers to a different, safe and working airplane? The fact that I have waiting over 2 hours because this unorganized airline either doesn't have enough working planes or don't care enough to get us moving."
"""Southwest can do better than this""","✅ Trip Verified | Charlotte to Minneapolis. Our flight was delayed due to other issues than weather leaving Charlotte this evening. In trying to determine whether to book a new flight in Charlotte we asked the staff. We were told that we had ten to fifteen minutes and should sit up front and run to the next concourse. We did not know it was on the other side of the airport. So we upgraded sat up front and ran to B22 in Chicago Midway to make our connection home to Minneapolis. Even though we made it to the gate and saw the plane sitting there, we were told that it was gone and we had to book a flight 3 hours later. And we needed to go back to where we were told to run from. There was no communication to the gate that passengers were running across the airport. This airport is the worst Southwest hub in the world and this was the second and last experience there. Southwest can do better than this."
"""flight attendants were great""","✅ Trip Verified | Louisville to Baltimore via Portland. Best flight ever. We did have a slight delay in initial take off due to a light being on but the flight attendants were great, funny, kind and made the experience excellent."
"""no heart or care in the world""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Norfolk via Baltimore. I flew out of Houston, TX to Norfolk, VA on 5Oct and was to return on 12Oct. My Daughter's 2nd Birthday was on the 7th of Oct. I went to the gate on the 5th for my departure, nothing was said about having to pay for my daughter's return flight because she was ""2"" now. I go to the airport to depart and was rudely told I need to pay for her ticket, and that the information is on the website - and that she is ""Sorry I didn't read it"". I would assume being in customer service and knowing the regulations that it would have still been told to me when looking at my daughter's Birth Certificate and seeing she turns two within the time of my stay in VA. I called the airline and they told me that I have no choice but to pay $243.80 for my daughter to fly back. I didn't anticipate the money and didn't have it. I had to miss my flight, and go back to a friends house that I stayed with. I didn't have a rental car anymore because I had to turn it in, so I had to wait for someone to come & get my daughter and I. After I got to my friends house I called and spoke withthe Customer Relations Dept and she said she was sorry about my situation and that I could apply for a donation ticket back. I went to the website and read that SWA gives away 40,000 free tickets a year to ""those in need"" but the request can take 6-8 weeks. I have a job I had to get back to, didnt have enough diapers, or anything to continue my stay. So, I called them back. Again, ""I am sorry, but there is no way around it- you'll have to pay"". I told the agent I can pay on the 19th, but will it still be the same amount of money for my daughter to fly back, and how much will it cost to change my reservations. She said they can't guarantee the price will be the same, and that she didn't know how much more out of pocket I would have to come out. I live paycheck to paycheck. I only went to VA because my oldest daughter gave birth to my first Grandchild, and it was important I would be there. I could have left my daughter with my Husband while I was gone if I would have known I had to pay for her return flight back. But since I was stuck there, no one cared and upper management that could have helped me, and also didnt want to get on the phone themselves did not help, nor care I was stranded without a vehicle and no place to go with my 2 year old daughter. I was fortunate enough to reach out to distant family and borrow the money to fly back home with my baby. I have never flown with SWA before, I always chose Delta - and from here on out I will stick with Delta. Not only are the flight attendants rude and their customer service is completely incompetent- they honestly have no heart or no care in the world. The Customer is not their priority."
"""went out of her way to help me""","✅ Trip Verified | Norfolk to Boston. When connection flight was delayed due to weather, Lynn was able to help me book my connecting flight in order to make my arrival time within 15 minutes. Mother Nature saw fit to delay us again but she went out of her way to help me even after a colleague said it wasn’t possible. Thank you, you are the best at customer service."
"""find this practice very unfair""","✅ Trip Verified | While traveling from Los Angeles to Denver, I requested to be put on stand-by, as an Southwest A List Preferred, the agent told me I was first on the list, but it was a full flight so there was no guarantee, which I understood. A few minutes later, while I was standing by the podium, I saw a lady ask the Agent to also be put on the A List Preferred stand-by list. This person was traveling with two other people that were not A List Preferred. The Southwest agent immediately gave this person a boarding pass, because she was traveling with two people that paid to get on an earlier flight. I find this practice very unfair to give preferred preference to another A-List Member because they were travel with two other people."
"""disappointed in this airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Tampa to St Louis. I’m disappointed in this airline. The last 2 times I’ve flown with them my flight has been significantly delayed (at lest an hour each time). Last time a drunk person that wouldn’t leave the plane and never should have got on. This time because a captain wasn’t there? And only when leaving St. Louis, never when leaving Tampa. It’s been my airline of choice for years but considering when I can’t rely on departure time to find another airline."
"""Extremely inflexible!""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Los Angeles. Worst airline. Extremely inflexible! Had a flight booked from Denver to Los Angeles, booked the flight early and did not pay top dollar. We wanted to leave on a earlier flight and called the airline and they had 8 open seats. They wanted to charge me $500+ to change the flight to the same exact flight but two hours earlier. They person I spoke with said we can try to go to the airport early and see if they would accommodate us. Went early and they said no - we didnt pay enough for our tickets. They said if our flight is delayed they would change it. Our flight was delayed 10 mins but they said had to be 15 minutes. Had to wait 2 hour, even though there were 8 open seats on the earlier flight. The manager was extremely rude."
"""Not at all happy with Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Nashville to Pittsburgh. I had paid extra for A group but turns out there were already 15 to 20 people on the plane from the previous flight that all moved to the front on the plane. This is not a fair way to board. If they leave the plane they should re board with everyone else and if they choose to stay on thru should remain in their original seats. I feel scammed for paying the extra money to board in A group and I will not fly southwest again. I asked the agent at gate C 22 about this and she looked at me like I was the rudest person for asking why this is. Not at all happy with Southwest."
"""continuously unimpressed""","Not Verified | Denver to Raleigh Durham. I am continuously unimpressed with this airline. The only reason to fly with Southwest is if you are on a budget. Their services are not up to par with other airlines, and if you are a frequent traveler they are consistently frustrating. For example, the past three flights I have been on, the WiFi didn’t work at all. Now that I am on a 737-700 that somehow has working WiFi, I can barely load Outlook let alone this page. I can’t count on this airline for on time departures or arrivals, or for getting any work done on the plane. Why as a business customer would I be interested in this airline for anything other than the price"
"""nicest airline staff""","✅ Trip Verified | One of the friendliest and nicest airline staff, cheerful and helpful. Since I am handicapped that is a great plus. Their assistance to me as a wheelchair assist customer was fabulous. The gates and the plane were very clean and well staffed. Even the Pilots greeted me with cheerful smiles and a good morning. The seats on the 737-700 are somewhat narrow and the seat belts were a little too short to be easy to use. Avoid the seats on the left side front row, extremely tight!"
"""Favorite US airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Santa Ana. Thanks to Southwest in Houston. I am travelling with a friend who was on a different flight landing at a different airport and the excellent Southwest personnel at gate 41 was able to accommodate us on the same flight. Thanks so much Southwest! Favorite US airline."
"""customer service is just poor""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Phoenix. Delays and incompetent staff. Southwest could benefit from teaching all of their employees to take responsibility regardless of who’s job certain things actually are. For example. I entered the airport with an 18 month old. I asked the woman checking us in if I could check the car seat at that time she said no and to check it at the gate. At this time it would have been nice if she had mentioned the baby needed a boarding pass. Since he was a lap child I did not know that he needed a boarding pass until I got to the gate to board. I then had to get out of the line to get the babies boarding pass printed. Is it a huge deal no but the customer service industry needs to anticipate and serve the customer. This just leads me to believe they don’t care about customer service. While I was dealing with this issue the ladies printing the boarding pass pointed out out how that was someone else’s job. After I got the boarding pass I went to board the plane and gave my car seat. I was then told it needed a tag and I was asked why I didn’t get a tag as I was getting the baby’s boarding pass. As if it were my fault. The customer service is just poor. I have several other examples and they of course seem small."
"""disappointment I’ve experienced""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Burbank. Southwest is the worst airline I’ve experience, to put it bluntly. I cannot understand the complete disorganization with this airline. There are constant delays and never assigned seating which make the delays even worse. I have traveled Southwest a couple of times and never been satisfied but this has to be the most disappointment I’ve experienced, seems to be getting worse. I don’t typically post horrible reviews, but this last flight got me so frustrated I just feel it should be known."
"""never had a bad experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Oklahoma City to Tucson. I have never had a bad experience with Southwest Airlines. Unfortunately, I made a bad choice and booked with another airline for my upcoming trip (UA & AA). After booking I realized there were a lot of hidden fees and a lot of restrictions that added an additional 100 to the trip and that is before the checked bag fee. Needless to say I am not happy with my choice."
"""asked to pay an additional $300""","Not Verified | Chicago to Newark. The policy on switching flights needs a lot of work. Possibly start by working on a ""stand by"" situation. My husband arrived at the airport 5 hours before his scheduled flight. So, he decided to ask for an earlier flight but was asked to pay an additional $300 to confirm the switch. Ridiculous. Called customer service, same answer. Sat at the terminal and watched everyone board. Asked the people again, same answer. There were extra seats on the flight. What is the problem? $300.00? Way to go Southwest, way to go. You have lost all my business."
"""Very poor customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | I purchased early boarding when I purchased my ticket. Needed to be in Hartford and have my bags at 12:30 to secure my ride home. In realizing that we were supposed to land at 12 I purchased upgrading boarding for $50. Well lo and behold, the flight was delayed. Their reason was that another flight was late and they were waiting for a bag? Really? You inconvenience an entire flight for one bag? We did not land in time and I missed my ride thus having to pay again to get home. I asked for a refund of the $50 and was declined, because I was able to board the plane early. (I only boarded early from A37 to A7). Very poor customer service. Not my 1st bad experience with Southwest. Will be flying other airlines from now on."
"""being money hungry""","Not Verified | Orlando to Las Vegas. Southwest is being money hungry and also dismissive to concerns on program and pricing changes. And they used a bait and switch method. I booked my flights some time ago and was offered the early bird check in option at an additional cost of $60 RT for my wife and I. I went back to book it and now the price is $100. When I called, I was told that the program changed at the end of August. Mind you the $60 is already a fee to get checked in early so you have a better boarding group time so you can rush on and pick your seats. The other airlines allow you to select a seat at booking so you do not have to get on the plane searching for your seat and beat out someone else like it is the last bottle of water before a hurricane. I would have saved money going with another carrier and not had to pay for the privilege of getting a better line up position to then still have to search for two seats together where we would like to sit. I talked to a few lower level staff that agreed with me that I should be able to get the original rate I was quoted at the time of booking. However, they could not help me. They did say they are getting similar feedback and it is not going over well. I called corporate at their direction and that got worse. The person at corporate was unapologetic and cold professional. She informed me that basically it is an ancillary rate and they have the right to change it at any time. She did understand my point about being offered a price on an already booked flight but was unwilling to do anything to assist. She then said they notified people by placing a disclaimer on their site for 8 days at the end of August. I had already purchased my ticket and have the app so had no reason to go back on the site. No email or reaching out to someone that already purchased. So they took what was already a junk fee for something no one else charges for and increased it to make more profit. She said well at the lower cost too many people were using it so it was not really an advantage to those buying it. And based on that feedback they felt raising the price to reduce the number of people purchasing it would make it more valuable for those buying it. I mean they could have just limited it to the first 50 people that purchase it or something like that. So buy early and get the advantage. That is how the best seat assignments work on other airlines. Instead they would thin the heard by raising the price and pricing people out in order to make it a better experience for those that can and are willing to pay. It is a greedy money grab. They sell themselves as different, and better and “we got rid of assigned seats and tickets to make fares lower.” But really it just is good marketing because they intend to get it from you on the backend. In all actuality I could have gone with another airline and saved and had seat assignments and not had to pay an extra fee. And this day and age no longer do they really have to print that many paper tickets with tickets on phone apps. At the end of the conversation I recapped that they offered a price on a confirmed booking and then changed it later without due diligence notification. I informed her that it was a bait and switch and also poor form for such a respected company. It was underhanded and not appreciated and was just raising what was already a junk fee. She then had the audacity to ask if I wanted to book the extra service I was complaining about, really?"
"""say it wasn't their fault""","Not Verified | Flying from San Diego to Las Vegas. Flight 2828 got pushed back until canceled. Wasn't told why the flight got canceled - rebooking agent said all i can do is reschedule for a flight in the morning. Missed my hotel check in that night and friends party. Got an email reply saying that due to weather was the flight canceled - not sure how that goes because it was clear in both cities that night. Asked Southwest Airlines to reimburse me for that one of hotel and they say they couldn't because it wasn't their fault. So last time we will fly with Southwest Airlines."
"""never notified of delay times""","Not Verified | We were flying from Atlanta to Milwaukee for my sister in laws wedding. Our flight was scheduled to stop in Baltimore then continue to Milwaukee. We hit a storm and understandably we were delayed. We had to stop in DC because we needed fuel and Baltimore was temporarily closed. Upon arriving at DC we were just waiting for fuel. That then turned into waiting over an hour for new pilots. During this entire time we were never notified of delay times or that the Milwaukee flight was cancelled. We finally arrived in Baltimore at 1 am and were told our flight was canceled and they rescheduled us for the morning. We went to a counter to get our boarding pass and to figure out overnight reservations. Southwest would not pay for the hotel accommodations and told us to sleep at the airport or pay for a hotel ourselves. They also couldn’t even upgrade our boarding and we are stuck boarding very last. Overall very disappointed with how Southwest handled the situation. I understand you can’t control the weather but there was zero communication once we were at DC airport. The flight attendants were very nice and encouraged us to write to Southwest."
"""fly again with Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Kansas to San Diego. My son had to have an earlier flight to get to his military post and I called and they changed it without hesitation. The person I spoke to was very friendly and professional. Really made my day and my heart happy. Thanks again and will fly again with Southwest!"
"""unhappy with his attitude""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Milwaukee. Southwest has open seating policy, so passengers like to sit either on isle or next window. My wife and I found two seats and sat, a crew member said “sir sir what are you doing” while I was putting my carry on in the over head. He said there are enough room to sit somewhere else. We decided to sit since I have put our carryons. The customer sitting next to window shows unhappy face why we sat next to him! Then the crew shows face and says we go sit somewhere else while it is non of his business where we sit. Then we found another two seats available and we go sit next to someone else. The crew shows hand and face gestures to the other passenger comes and shows attitude why we asked the other passenger to let us into the two available seats. I don’t understand when they have opening seating policy the crew has any right to tell us where to sit or not and being so rude about it. My wife told him that she was unhappy with his attitude and asked his name and wished him have a good day. His response was “oh I am having a good day, you have a good day” with sarcasm. Totally dissatisfied with Southwest and its employee."
"""airline was the least helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | La Guardia to Indianapolis. I received no call, text or email regarding my flight cancellation. After I got through to security I pulled up my boarding pass to check where to go but the information was not updated. The screens with gate information were all off and not knowing where to go I stood in line to a flight that could have potentially gotten me home hoping there may be room on it because tickets were still being sold online for it. I stood in line and the lady was rude and told me to go to a different line and that she can't help me; I explained where i need to go, that I've not gotten any communication about cancellation, that I've been waiting to figure out what's going on and they said the flight I tried to get was booked. I asked why it is allowing me to purchase a ticket online and they just shoved me to a different gate where i was on line for even longer. Due to no communication of even alerting me that the flight was cancelled via email or text, how dismissive the lady at the first gate was, having to wait additional time, contradictory information about the flight being booked, i was experiencing anxiety. There was not a single person who expressed any empathy in form of ""sorry"" or ""let me see what we can do"" - no one cared. I was told the flight will be tomorrow. I told them if i pay for the ticket boarding right next door - can i get on that flight or will I have trouble. And they kept saying i cannot book that flight even though the site was asking me to input credit card info for that same ticket. I just asked for a refund and booked a flight with a different airline. Delays and cancellations are frustrating for everyone, but this airline was the least helpful in arranging anything to help me get home. Also just about every airline alerts via text about delays or cancellations at this point. But if this is not done, turn on the screens with flight status at least."
"""we wanted to thank you""","✅ Trip Verified | Our child fell extremely ill a day before our business trip to Boston. We called Southwest to explain our situation of not wanting to leave our son the same day he got out of hospital. The agent was extremely helpful. She was able to not only push our flight to a much later flight she didn’t even charge us for the change fee. This is beyond the call of duty. As parents we wanted to thank you for the extra effort. We will always fly Southwest!"
"""Very disappointed in Southwest today""","✅ Trip Verified | Very disappointed in Southwest today. I am A List Preferred so use your company frequently. Unwarranted delays and very poor communications. We are told because the flight is not full that we will wait 1/2 hour for two passengers. Sounds like this was done to save Southwest money. No regard for the other customers getting in 1 hour late. And the crew seemed to not care less. Too busy leaving the plane to get something to eat."
"""never use this airline again""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Hartford Bradley. My first and last time traveling with this airline. My flight was delayed 4 times 1.5 hours total with no explanation. I will never use this airline again."
"""not fly this airline again""","✅ Trip Verified | Cleveland to Baltimore. We are horrified by SouthWest's reaction towards our flight cancellation today. We tried calling at least 7 times and were redirected to a different rep each time with over an hour long wait with NO option to get a call-back. We received a casual text saying our flight was canceled at 930 am while we were already en route from Michigan driving to Cleveland Ohio to catch our flight. We literally had to call them and ask what else we could do, as we all had to get back to work. The reps and corporate acted like we were pestering them about this, when in reality we were the ones stranded - totally nuts. Other airlines were going the same route and didn't cancel. It barely rained. Poor excuse to say they were understaffed. We Ultimately had to buy a rental car which costs so much more than the original flights we had booked. Very unprofessional and will not fly with this airline again."
"""excellent hospitality""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Orlando. I made a mistake when preparing for my flight. I did not check if hiking poles were allowed on aircraft. They did not fit in either of my two free checked bags. Therefore. I attached them to my personal backpack to carry on the plane. I was stopped at the TSA security checkpoint and was told I was not allowed to bring them. They were expensive and I didn't want to forfeit them to TSA. My two previous checked bags had already been taken away for loading. I had pay $75 to check my personal backpack (being my 3rd checked bag). After purchasing the extra bag, I approached the check in counter. The Southwest employee told me that because the poles were not sealed in the bag (they stuck out of the top) there was a good possibility they would be lost and Southwest airlines would not be responsible for replacing them. I had not choice, but the take a chance. I secured them as best I could. The employee did not give me a luggage ticket, ensuring the airline would not be liable. After a nail biting 3 hour flight, I waited anxiously at baggage claim. Sure enough all three of my bags came through. The poles had separated from my personal backpack, but someone had secured them to my larger suitcase. I am extremely relieved and very grateful to that employee which ensured my belonging would get back to me. Thank you! As for the flight, the friendly staff provided excellent hospitality, offering snacks, drinks, and coffees. The seats allowed plenty of leg room. Our flight arrived 40 mins early!"
"""2 hours, twice delayed and counting""","✅ Trip Verified | Booked to fly Los Angeles to Albuquerque. As a small business owner, I understand if I show up 2 hours late to a job, I will owe some type of compensation to my customer. Why is it ok for airlines to delay flights and not compensate the customer in any way? I understand things come up like weather and maintenance issues but why is it my responsibility to pay the consequences for the airline’s mishap? I paid almost $200 to change my flight to a day sooner and now I’ve been at the airport for 4 hours waiting for Southwest Airlines to get things together. 2 hours, twice delayed and counting."
"""never fly with them again""","Not Verified | My flight was cancelled due to mechanical failure. When trying to rebook the staff working the counter was unwilling to help. I rebooked a flight to the closest airport to my final destination as there were no flights until tomorrow and I need to get back for work. They will not provide me with a rental car to get home even though my trip was entirely cancelled. Everyone I have spoke to on the phone has tried to get me to hang up as quickly as possible and placing me on hold for over an hour. This is my first and last experience with this airline. Customer service has been worse than anything I have experienced from the counter to the management on the phone. Learned a lesson and would never fly with them again even if the flight was free."
"""friendly, down to earth""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Washington via Atlanta. Southwest Airlines flight attendants are friendly, down to earth, professional and the aircraft is comfortable. There was a weather delay however the electronic updates were very user friendly and kept me well informed of my flight status. I like Southwest Airlines because they invest in modern technology not just for the aircraft but you are able to use the internet, also when boarding there are electronic/modern technology used. The attendant announces the boarding class and seat (which sometimes it is hard to hear in the airport or due to the person speaking) but South West electronic devices for the lines alerts with the seat or boarding zone so you can visually read it which is good for people who maybe hearing impaired. Also the flight attendants uniforms are not too professional making the customers feel more at ease. Great job Southwest! Also it is important to provide snacks and juice it refreshes the flyer and that shows good customer service and accommodation that you care for your friendly flyers. Thank you!"
"""Thanks for the disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified | I booked a flight with Southwest Airline for Sunday August 12, 2018 leaving Tampa, FL headed back home to Memphis, TN. While checking my email to ensure I had the correct gate location and departure time, I decided to check in online via Southwest website. To my surprise my flight was cancelled. I called their company at 11:00 AM and was on hold for 1 hour literally. The first lady who answered said ""yes it was cancelled but let me see if there is another flight leaving out the same day"" I responded with ""why was I not notified by email"" and she ignored me. I asked again and was told an email was sent at 9AM. I told her I check my emails around the clock and would have received a notification. She told me no flights were available for Sunday but I can leave on Monday or she can refund my money. There was no sympathy for what was just caused to me and my son. I asked to speak with a Manager and her response was ""Mam he's just going to tell you the same thing"" and I said I don't care, I need to speak with one. Well the Manager was horrible because I told them there was no way I could return Monday and that I was completely stranded and needed to get home Sunday. When I asked why was the flight cancelled he said ""the weather"" my response was ""sir I'm in Tampa and it's clear skies"" and the next thing I know I was placed instantly on hold, where I waited minutes and then the phone hung up. I called back several times with no response. I did there call back option when the sweetest woman who took her time trying to get me home on Sunday but said there was nothing else leaving out and it was too late for the one that was leaving at 4. This is how I knew there was a flight but the other two decided my faith even though I informed them of my situation. The agent found a flight and told me I could get to the airport and ask for assistance with a hotel but they don't refund money due to weather. She walked me through the flight details and I said wait let me take the information down, but she said it's coming through email. I saw the email instantly, so how ironic that hers came through but the alleged cancellation email did not. So my 1 hour no stop trip that was canceled has turned into 7 hours + with a stop in San Antonio TX, Dallas, another flight, then home from 3:30 PM -9:55 PM. No apology from Management, inconvenienced, stranded with a 12 year old, no clean clothes, no food, and no money. It's safe to say they can take off anytime without my family. This took away the joy, excitement, and turned my day into a living nightmare. For future events, a simple apology, and a notification goes a long way. I could have tried to make arrangements but I guess that wasn't an option for them. Thanks for the disappointment."
"""No call or text""","Not Verified | Minneapolis to Raleigh Durham via Baltimore. Southwest canceled our connecting flight from BWI to RDU today. No call or text. Fortunately, I checked my e-mail and saw a cancelation message. It was ""my problem"" to fix. There was no proactive effort from Sowthwest. It was too late to book earlier flights, so I will now arrive home after midnight. Worse yet, because I had to rebook, I ""lost my place in the boarding process"", so we will be the last ones on the plane and its unlikely we will be able to sit together or store our bags. Thanks a lot Southwest!"
"""attendants were rude""","✅ Trip Verified | From the moment we got on the plane the flight attendants were rude to the customers. There is a way you can professionally communicate to your customers rather than being hateful to them. Then I had to use the ladies room in flight and the lady was rude to me directly and in front of the rest of the flight which I found very embarrassing. We fly Southwest all the time but this experience definitely tainted my view of Southwest and I will look elsewhere from here on out."
"""misrepresented their values""","Not Verified | La Guardia to Atlanta. Southwest promotes that you can receive travel funds for any canceled tickets. However, they make every effort to make it difficult for you to access your own money. These travel funds are not placed and visible on your account. The expiration information is unclear. Once it expires, if you are willing to hassle them they pay you the ""courtesy"" of charging you a $100 to access your remaining credit. I called and spoke with over 4 representatives over multiple days and was given misinformation. They will not help you with this process but require that you call back after it has expired. It then takes 4-6 weeks to process this request until you are able to access the remaining small fraction of your own money. I will utilize my remaining points and then I will not fly Southwest again. This has completely changed my impression of Southwest. I used to view them as a reasonable company with fair practices. I feel that they misrepresented their values. Delta has harsher return policies but I now appreciate them for their transparency."
"""Flights are always late""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Oakland. Flights are always late. I got to the airport 4 hours early because of a change in my business plans. They would not allow me on an earlier flight even though they announced at the gate there were 20 available seats. Southwest wanted to charge me $169 to change then my flight was late which they did not announce until it was boarding time. That is why as a business traveler my loyalty is to American. They accommodate a change if they can. 8 our of my past 10 flights with Southwest have been late."
"""great cabin service""","✅ Trip Verified | On 7/24/18 my wife and four children were flying from West Palm Beach to Boston via Atlanta on a 8PM flight. We had just concluded a 1 week vacation. My youngest son whose is 12-years old had not been feeling well prior to boarding the flight, probably from eating too much all week/day long. Well we boarded flight 1204 and after a brief delay were air bound. Needless to say, the plane ride was not agreeing with my son, and he soon became ill. Luckily, he managed to get everything into the bags provided in the seat backs. I flagged down one of the cabin attendants and he immediately came over. This man could not have been any nicer, he made light of an embarrassing situation for my son and set him right at ease. Soon the other male attendant came over and also jumped to help. I can't say enough good things about these two guys, they were great! The one attendant in particular assigned to the rear of the plane must have came back and checked on my son at least half a dozen times, truly a nice gesture and a nicer guy! I give this airline serious props for employing caring individuals like these two men, great cabin service."
"""leaving your customers stranded""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago Midway to Newark. It is irritating when you travel with an airline 5 times and a flight gets canceled every. Single. I can understand the cancellations due to the weather. I can also understand the cancelations due to ""scheduled maintenance "" (badly scheduled if the plane was supposed to be flying though.) What I don't understand is how thinking that leaving your customers stranded overnight at the airport is ok. It is not. Allowing the customers to reschedule ""for free"" for a flight the airline canceled should not even be a question much less something that gets thrown in your face. No attempt or offer was made for a hotel or another place to spend the night. No offer or attempt was made to get us back into the same boarding position we had prior to our flight being canceled due to ""scheduled maintenance "" Delays are irritating but at least you get where you want to. Unscheduled cancelations are not ok. Being forced to stay in the bagging area overnight because security shuts down the terminals overnight, is not ok."
"""poor business practice""","✅ Trip Verified | Deceptive and misrepresenting their low fares. Last minute cancellation of my original carrier, Delta, made it necessary to make an alternative flight plan. Southwest ticketing agent informed me that the flight was sold out of lower fares and only the higher fares were available. The 1 way ticket price from Indianapolis to Orlando was $414.98. Traveling with my son required 2 tickets, $829.96. Boarding the plane it was empty, hence we were lied to reqarding the availability of lower fares. We were simply gouged with the higher fare because of urgent circumstances. Called the corporate headquarters of Southwest and they gave me the story that low fares are not available for disparate last minute travelers. The attendant on the flight stated that lower fares were available for this flight as it is low demand flight. This simply is a poor business practice for an airline that markets low fares and has the deceptive image of a friendly and customer service oriented. In the future when I fly again I will try to avoid this airline."
"""Worst flight experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to New York. Worst flight experience to date. I am currently stranded in Chicago with a flight to NYC from Detroit. Our first flight was delayed 4 hours and then cancelled. I got rebooked on a later flight which has now been delayed for the 3rd time. I called customer service only to be told by the supervisor that there's nothing they can do. If you want to be stuck in an airport all day with no compensation, go to Southwest. If you actually want a quality flight, avoid this airline at all costs."
"""not travel Southwest in future""","Not Verified | Providence to Ft Lauderdale. You check in early to get a good boarding group number (B2-4), when you get on the plane one attendant is reserving a row for someone whose other family members are at the end of the boarding line, so now the 3 people you’re traveling with can’t be seated together and have to be separated when it’s first come first serve based on boarding number. They don’t assign seats but then they reserve seats? Umm not okay and completely inappropriate. This is not the first time they have reserved seats or a row for people who checked in late and are in the end of the boarding line. I gave them a second chance and same result, so I can verify I will not travel Southwest in the future. They can keep their 1st bag free policy I rather have assigned seating and sit with who I came with!"
"""avoid them at all costs""","✅ Trip Verified | Southwest Airlines cancelled our flight and could not get us on another for over 24 hours leaving us stranded in New York. We had no place to stay and the cheapest room we could find was over $600. Southwest said it was not their responsibility and gave us $100 vouchers to fly with them again as compensation. I am upset and disappointed at SWA’s lack of responsibility and would avoid them at all costs. They do not care about their passengers, even when it was their issue that cancels your flight."
"""cancelled our flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Philadelphia. Horrible, we had a direct flight they cancelled our flight last minute gave us a connecting flight, this is the fourth time they did this to us. Seems to me [and other passengers] they sell on a direct flight and cancel the last minute. Other people we knew traveled on other airlines with direct flights they had no problems. So Southwest can not use the weather as their typical excuse"
"""service has been subpar""","✅ Trip Verified | I have been a loyal SW Air passenger for years. I fly once a month, at least. For a while, the service has been subpar. Flights are late, like tonight, with my connecting flight, or earlier in July, on my last flight. On my last flight, I noticed a crack near my window. I told one of the attendants and she seemed annoyed. Tonight, I was checked in 40 minutes before the flight and was told my bag probably wouldn’t make it. At the gate in San Antonio, I asked one of the attendants if my bag had made it. She said she had no way to check. Really? This decline started a few years ago when their gift cards for a free drink came with an expiration date. What kind of gift is that?"
"""What a horrible day""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. As I sit on the tarmac for about 20 min now I’m writing this. What a horrible day. We were 1st delayed in SLC flight was suppose to leave at 7:05 then 8:35 and then finally 8:50 and actually departing around 9:15ish. For a flight that has been already delayed you would think that someone would have done something other than leave us on the plane for approaching 30 min now. So many people are now missing connection flights. Me personally had a dinner engagement for someone’s birthday who drove out all the way from Palm Springs. Well you guess it that plan was completely ruined and they have now been waiting around and can not even get into the hotel room to wait. SW really needs to get these things figured out. BTW definitely not the 1st time this has happened and really deciding to pay the extra to fly with some other airline as I have not really had this problem with United or American also no WiFi and no inflight entertainment I fly close to 50 times per year."
"""day was such a disaster""","Not Verified | New York to Amarillo. I was supposed to get home at 3:00 PM. I got home at 2:00 AM. However, because the day was such a disaster, I would love to add extra vilification. The day started off with a casual 4:00 wake up call since security is especially hard being in a family of 10. But, looking back, that was the only part of my day that went right at all. After arriving at the gate on time for our 6:30 AM flight, the airline promptly updated the online southwest app of an hour delay but did not inform any of us in person. An hour later, the crew announced that there were difficulties with an essential radio in the cabin. Regardless, we were all lined up and loaded into the plane anyway. But the plane never took off. Four more hours later, we waited for them to call out all of our names as a role call. However, they still pulled us all off, lined us up, and started it all over again. That flight had no further problems, but we missed both of the connecting flights. Only due to several miracle cancellations were we even able to get the two more flights to Amarillo. The second flight was from 5-6, and, aside from a couple hour layover, proceeded as planned. The third flight was scheduled, at first, to be from 10:00-11:00 PM. Then it was delayed one hour, again with the gate not informing us of the reason for or the hindrance itself. Then it was delayed another half hour. Then another. And then finally we were able to reach Amarillo. As a disclaimer, however, we were fairly compensated monetarily for the disaster. Another less fortunate woman missed her son’s wedding as a result of the flight inefficiency."
"""pleasant and helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | SouthWest SMF-DAL, HOU-SEA, SEA-SMF We flew 3 legs in the USA with SouthWest and were quite impressed. All staff we had dealings with were pleasant and helpful, with the exception of a big man at kerbside check-in at Seattle who blatantly asked for a tip. That was the only negative about this efficient and professional operation. The airline offers passengers 2 checked bags for free, along with carry-on items and a discount fare for seniors. Each passenger is allocated a boarding number and must queue in order prior to boarding the plane. No seats are allocated and passengers choose where they want to sit, with the earlier on-line check- ins and business class getting a higher priority. This boarding procedure expedites the process resulting in a very rapid embarkation. The three flights we took departed and arrive on, or close to, time. On board and boarding lounge announcements varied from good, to too fast to be understood, or inaudible. The crew hand out free snacks, coffee and non-alcoholic drinks. Stronger stuff is available at a price. The seat spacing is generous compared to Australian low-cost carriers with 5 inches (13cm.) between my knees and the back of the seat in front. Interestingly, only a handful of passengers reclined their seats. All crew were friendly and some chatty making for a pleasant journey. I mislaid my wallet in Sacramento Airport and the SouthWest staff in Dallas were exceptionally helpful, understanding and sympathetic."
"""I was humiliated""","✅ Trip Verified | My niece lives with me and her mom (my sister) at our family ranch in Texas part of the time and the other part she lives in CA with her father. I have always used Dallas Lovefield Southwest Airlines for her to fly. Her mom and I always accompany her to the gate. It is an important time for us to be able to say our goodbyes. It is especially hard on her mom when we say goodbye and I am usually there to smooth things over. This time the ticketing person did not allow me to go. He said only one person can accompany. Meanwhile my niece starts crying tears running down her face and i have to tell her i cannot accompany her. I asked to talk to a supervisor and she was very rude and told me no and that the person who let 2 people before should not have done that. I have always used southwest for your friendly accommodations and i will not anymore. My niece was devastated and the supervisors lack of empathy was disheartening. I'm sure that if the supervisor was dropping off her child more than one person could drop her off. I was humiliated and my niece was devastated."
"""service has gone down""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to La Guardia. I’ve been a loyal southwest customer for several years now, flying with them over 30 flights. They’re delays and cancellations are worse than other airlines, but I stick with them due to the no change fees. On the day before my wedding shower, they abruptly cancelled my flight via text. I scrambled to find another flight. I called, and they said it was due to maintenance and put me on a flight the following day, which wasn’t an option, so I paid an exuberant amount for a different airline, which took off within an hour of the cancelled flight (so not weather related). I rarely call for anything, even when I have severe delays due to scheduled maintenance or disorganization on southwests behalf, but this was especially frustrating so I called. The man on the phone was so condescending. He told me it was due to air traffic control and kept repeating himself when I asked for more details and for understanding. He kept interrupting me and yelled at me. He wouldn’t allow me to speak to a supervisor but then said his boss would get him in trouble for helping me out. He was so harsh and given my lack of sleep due to southwest delays, I broke into tears. Customer service has gone down, and I plan on spending my points and running as far as I can from Southwest. So disorganized and unable to admit or explain their actions."
"""they cancelled my flight""","✅ Trip Verified | I was due to fly with my son from Houston to New York for his birthday. My first flight was cancelled, these things happen so I postponed our trip by 24hrs. Same itinerary just delayed, then again today they cancelled my flight. They have no ability to re schedule and the customer service rep I spoke to shouldn’t be allowed to speak to customers. The reason I was given, they are canceling flights in case of thunder storms in New York later today. Utter nonsense. I’ve rebooked with United, twice the cost but at least we might get there!"
"""turned into a 13 hr trip""","✅ Trip Verified | Louisville to Sacramento via Denver. I have had 2 flights cancelled on my last 2 trips. 10 days ago flight from bwi to sdf - (this was a two hour trip that turned into a 13 hr trip). Today my 6 hour trip turned into a 12 hour flight. Both flights were cancelled due to weather. Checking the radar and all is clear."
"""lost the kids' luggage""","✅ Trip Verified | Kansas City to Tampa. Three flying at different times. My children (10 and 12) went solo to Florida and I wasn't able to get a security clearance to go to the gate from Sky Cap because the Southwest rep was missing. My flight down two weeks later was delayed an hour and had two gate changes. The airline lost the kids' luggage during their flight back the following week. They found it at 2pm, was given a time frame of 4-6 hours. Still missing at 8pm, was given the name and phone number of the delivery man. Called at 845, was told that I had the wrong number when I called (I had confirmed the number). Called customer service again, was given a 10pm delivery time instead. Have another hour to wait before I call again. Asked what happens if he doesn't show up, the representative said, ""I really don't know."" Not feeling well about the amount of money spent on all of these flights at the moment."
"""Southwest doesn't seem to care""","Not Verified | We left Austin at 5.30 am on Thursday 7-12-18, got to Baltimore approx. 9.50 am. Flight got canceled and we spent the rest of our day tracking down our luggage. Our final destination was Portland, ME, but we ended up in Manchester, NH. Had to pay for a hotel room and pay for a rental car to get to Portland the next day. The vacation was going fine until we got to the airport today. It's happening all over again. Flight was delayed over 3-hours and we are missing our a joining flight. Paying for a hotel room again, missing work tomorrow. Southwest doesn't seem to care. What money we thought we were saving with Southwest has ended up costing us almost twice as much. Will never fly Southwest again. It's not because of the mishaps, it's because of the lack of caring. I do have a choice when I fly and I will exercise that choice the next time I fly. One Unhappy Customer."
"""the worst flight experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Panama City beach. This has been the worst flight experience with southwest and will not book again. First, after 2 months of having a flight booked they changed the schedule which had an arrival difference of 6 hrs and took over 2 hrs on the phone to have something done. Next, we arrive on time for our flight and are told the flight is delayed because there are no flight attendants available for our flight. This airline is a joke. Obviously customer service is there last priority and they act like they are doing you a favor. Thanks for the wasted vacation day southwest. You sure know how to waste someone’s time at our own expense."
""" lack of customer service""","Not Verified | This will be the last time I fly with Southwest. The lack of customer service I experienced was unbelievable. They cancelled our flight and the next available flight was 10 hrs later. The woman who rescheduled our flight didnt mention that our bags had been pulled and we would need to collect them at the baggage claim. Also, when i asked about meal vouchers, they said they only give those out for mechanical issues not weather related. Southwest makes the customer feel solely responsible for fixing their idiotic mistakes. How about you take some responsibility and make the consumer feel valued and appreciated. Apparently my time isn't worth a knowledgeable employee or 1 free meal."
"""no explanation from Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew from BWI to DAL via HOU and then DAL to BWI. My first time flying on Southwest definitely had some odd occurrences. Flying to DAL from BWI was uneventful, but for some reason before we headed to the airport I received an email from the airline saying that our flight was late. But at the airport the check in staff said that the flight was on time. The problem came on our return flight. our flight from DAL to BWI was supposed to depart at 5:50 pm CST, but I received notification that the flight was going to be delayed by 90 minutes. At the airport the delay became two hours and then two and a half hours! There was no explanation from Southwest of why this was the case as the weather in Dallas was fine. By the time we finally took off from Dallas our flight was delayed for three hours with no explanation from Southwest why this was the case nor an apology from the crew. According to my Flightradar 24 app I was able to determine that the plane started from Phoenix, then flew to Reno, and then flew to Dallas and was delayed by two hours from the beginning. At least Southwest could've brought out a spare plane for the flight to Baltimore if they knew the airplane was behind schedule. I sent a complaint via Twitter and did receive a voucher from Southwest, but at least they should've provided more information with regards to the status of the plane."
"""open seating is a joke""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Las Vegas. This is the absolute worst airline I’ve ever given business to. Open seating is a joke unless you’re traveling alone, their app is completely worthless since you still have to go to a desktop site or kiosk at the airport, and if you are more than a 30” waist size you will be touching the other people in your row, who thanks to open seating are not your spouse/children if you aren’t in boarding group A. I understand now why the tickets were cheaper than the other airlines, it seems likely they are starving for business since I can’t imagine ever booking with Southwest again."
"""crew was happy to be at work""","Not Verified | Portland to Florida Beaches via Baltimore. Our daughter was flying home on her birthday. As a preteen this was not her preferred date of travel but it was the best date for our family. The flight attendants not only helped make her birthday special by singing to her, but they created a special birthday crown, had the cabin turn on their call buttons lights as candles and invited the entire plane in singing happy birthday. The crew was happy to be at work even though this was their last flight after a long day."
"""Rude customer service""","Not Verified | Reno to Philadelphia via Chicago. Our flight was delayed in Reno by nearly 2 hours because of weather. Yes you cannot help that, but Southwest employees ensured us that our connecting flight in Chicago would hold for us and the rest of the people making this connection. Once we arrived in Chicago we found out the flight did not wait and the next flight was in the morning and were told our checked baggage would be there in the morning as well. After roaming the airport all night because we weren’t provided a hotel because it was weather related the time came to finally board our plane. Once I arrived in Philly I found out my baggage is missing. Rude customer service at the baggage claim by southwest. I also called Southwest baggage claims to see if they were able to track my bags. I was told that was coming in the future - why are there bar codes on our luggage if they do not track it? Why do we put our email and phone number on our bags if they don’t call you to tell you where your things are located? Straight trash. I will never fly Southwest Airlines again nor will I recommend them to anyone. Rude customer service that lies to you and doesn’t care about your stuff."
"""never book another SW flight""","✅ Trip Verified | You know this by far is the worst airline, yes you get 2 bags free but you have to wait for all the people that take advantage of the preboarding with 1 white pass who bring an additional 10 people. You pay extra for early bird check in still have to wait - what's the point. My flight had a 1025 pm take off we didnt leave till midnight. I will never book another SW flight. No Sorry for the inconvenience. Just Sad"
""" seats are ridiculously close""","✅ Trip Verified | Providence to Orlando. Waited hour and a half before finally taxiing to take off. Then, only after we were in the air for 30 mind, they announced they forgot to mention earlier that the wifi wasn't working. The seats are ridiculously close to one another, so much so, that the tray pressed against the average adult's stomach when in the lowered position. The aisle is so narrow, even our skinny six year old daughter has difficulty walking down it facing forward. You have to shuffle sideways the entire length of the aisle. Between the aisle size and lack of space between seats, they really manage to cream as many people onboard as possible. In the bathroom, you have to hold the toilet seat in the up position, otherwise it falls down. Which makes it difficult to use the bathroom, steady yourself, and hold the seat up. The faucet of the sink sprays out so hard, it splashes onto you. Overall, it was the second worst flight I've ever been on, (and I can say with confidence that I've flown at least a hundred times on my lifetime). The only worse flight I've been on was also a Southwest flight. Between their standard policies of poor service, unassigned seats, and parts flying off their aircraft; and all of the aforementioned problems, I can't discourage using Southwest strongly enough."
"""my favorite airline""","Not Verified | I flew Southwest from Detroit to Atlanta and later Atlanta to Houston. They were fast and excellent flights. Our Atlanta to Houston flight was very bumpy and had some of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, but that isn't the pilot's fault. The flight attendants were very nice and Southwest offers free drinks and snacks as well as a free live TV system through their WiFi page. My only complaints are their comfort and their baggage handling. My light pink suitcase came back with one side nearly black, and when I flew American a few years to Phoenix my bag was not that ruined and my Phoenix flight was a shorter trip. I haven't flown any airline besides Southwest in the last 5 years and for domestic flights I don't plan any other airline to take their spot as my favorite airline."
"""you don't get a kudos from me""","Not Verified | I fly to and from Chicago and Phoenix Az a lot since we purchased a retirement home in AZ. My mother is 85 years old and I go back and forth every month to help her with Doc appts etc, as she does not drive. I had book a roundtrip ticket to fly to Chicago for May 23, 2018 and a return flight back to Phoenix on June 16, 2018. As the time got closer my husband decided to drive to Chicago so we could stay for the summer. We have two dogs so that is why he wanted to drive. We left Phoenix on May 19th it's a 3 day drive. While on our drive I didn't want to forget to cancel the flight so I decided to do it on my cell phone. Well anyone who has a cell phone knows that when you are traveling signal is not the greatest and in some areas not at all. I tried multiple to cancel my flight on my phone but I guess due to the signal it didn't go thru. I decided to screen shot my attempt at cancelling and would try again once I was at my destination on a landline. Well I forgot. I made a mistake. While here in Illinois on the 23rd of May I received an email from Southwest stating I was a no show for my flight. I immediately got on the phone trying to explain my situation to no avail. I was told because I didn't cancel my flight It cancelled the entire reservation, which is totally not fair. I agree that they didn't have to refund my flight to Chicago, but I also lost money for the flight for June. I am a regular customer I fly Southwest a lot since 2015. I only use Southwest, I sit there and read in the magazine all these great stories, this time my story is not so great. I have tried everything possible to get this rectified and nothing. I am totally disappointed in this airline. If I could tell the world my story I would, but my advice is never book a roundtrip ticket and never try to do anything on a cell phone while traveling thru the mountains. As for forgetting to do it later, It was a mistake on my part I am human. Sorry Southwest you don't get a kudos from me!"
"""threatening to bump me""","✅ Trip Verified | The airport we arrived at Midway at 11:30 and I saw there was a flight at 1:05 leaving for Cincinnati and I went and asked if I could get on it. Originally told that there may be a fee but she called someone and said wait right. She said closer to flight time we are going to be looking for volunteers anyway as your flight is overbooked. So she said if you wait close to 1:00 I can move you and give you $800 credit per ticket too, but be patient. So I was waiting and when it came time and got close I then saw a shift change and they were talking and the original worker said they are right there. Then the plane was almost boarded and she said are you needing something. I told her we are the Cincinnati couple her response was looking me dead in the face and said o we don't do that. So I left nicely and then time for our flight came and she then asked me to move to a 10:00 pm flight instead of 3:00 and if I take it now I would get the vouchers still if not I might get kicked off this flight anyway. Excuse me but I tried to help you and keep you from having empty seats in the air but you told me you don't do that. Now you are threatening to bump me. Now I have filed multiple complaints with this company and they have told me sorry their employees should know better and they will work on their training tools and also that I am not a high enough tier for them to worry about. Thanks Southwest but I don't think so not anymore. Tried to help you and got slapped in the face!"
"""never get another dime from me""","Not Verified | Oklahoma City to Orlando. Never again will I waste my time or money with this joke of a business. It has now taken me 2 days to go on my vacation in Orlando. Yesterday my flight was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight. So SW put me on a 6am flight to Dallas, then to KC only for the plane to break and now I’m stuck in KC. I’m farther away from FL than I originally started, I’m over this vacation. I fly back on Sat and I won’t get there until Thursday now - poor business. They’ll never get another dime from me."
"""their policy on refunds""","Not Verified | This has to be the worst airline when it comes to their policy on refunds. I paid for a flight nearly two months in advance for two people. The person I was going with told me a month in advance that they will no longer be able to make the trip so I had to get them taken off the reservation. When I called them to let them know I needed to take the person off, they told me that the amount I paid for the ticket will go to that person to use instead me; the person who paid for the tickets. I truly do not understand how this makes any sense. They didn’t even try to do anything to make it right after being a preferred card holder and spending multiple dollars with them. I will no longer use their services any longer."
"""hostile customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Southwest Airlines has always been my go-to airline, until today. I recently had to cancel a flight for my husband due to injury about 2 weeks prior to our trip. My husband rarely travels, and I paid for the trip with my credit card which gives us further travel rewards. I was offered travel funds for the cancelled trip, and since I travel all the time planned to use them for a flight for me. What Southwest fails to mention is that the person who paid for the trip is not the one that is allowed to use the funds, its only the ticketed passenger. The lady I spoke to in customer service was extremely rude and told me the policies were clearly stated on the cancellation email (I looked- they are not). It is the worst customer service I have ever experienced from a company to date. I travel a lot and would rather take my business elsewhere then ever deal with such rude, hostile customer service again, especially from a company who prides themselves on transparency when that clearly is not the case! Do not waste your time with this company ever again! They've lost a long-time, loyal customer over this and you better believe I will tell anyone who will listen about their terrible customer service."
"""warmly took care of us""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Chicago Midway. Yesterday (June 25th) I was on WN 637 and the airplane had some major matenainence issues. I was one of at least 20 in wheelchairs, and fortunately we were boarded on the aircraft first, while the problem was taken care of. Our flight attendant was so gracious in greeting us, and for the time of more than an hour, she warmly took care of us and that time, really ""flew by"". She and her crew gave us water, etc, to make each of us more comfortable and that warm and lovely smile really meant a lot to each of us. Southwest is still one of my favorites, and in so many ways your expertise has progressed, and your standards are above the other airlines. I will always remember her, as one of the best flight attendants i have had over the years."
"""terrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Pittsburgh to Chicago. Second time flying with Southwest and my second bad experience. Was separated from my new wife while boarding. Booked the flights 8 months ago and checked in on the same confirmation and she was sat 43 seats behind me and the attendants would not do anything about it. Thank you for the terrible experience."
"""Southwest refuses to do anything""","✅ Trip Verified | Southwest Airlines has terrible customer service! For the longest time, I thought otherwise until my recent problem. I received an email in May notifying me my points were expiring July 1st. I called for details and was told I needed to book a flight with points by the 1st, but could fly after that date. After finding flights, I tried booking. I was told the prior information was incorrect and I had to fly before July 1st. It was June 21st. I called customer relations as I was making my decisions based on their employee's statements and already booked the other leg of my flight and my companion's flight. I was told the only way I could extend points is by spending money with their company or a partner company. Forgive me if I have no desire to spend money with a company that tells me incorrect information then punishes me for believing it. I requested they pull the phone call and was told the records were too old and had been erased. After 2 hours on the phone, I had no choice and had to pay to transfer points, which I didn't need, from my father's account in order to extend my expiration date. I have now been punished for a Southwest Airlines employee's error. Doesn't seem quite right if you ask me, but Southwest refuses to do anything."
"""I will avoid Southwest""","Not Verified | The first flight was ok nothing extraordinary. The trouble started when I landed in Chicago and found my connecting flight to Pittsburgh is cancelled. Southwest says it is due to weather, but other airline flights are still taking off. I do not see any thunderstorm or storm or anything. I would still have been ok if southwest had offered me overnight accommodation because of their cancellation. Right now am stranded at the airport with no flights until 8:30 am tomorrow morning, which will make me miss the 1st half of the workshop I am supposed to attend. This is pure carelessness of the Southwest Airlines not to consider the reasons someone might be traveling. They did not offer to check for tickets with another airlines, no accommodation and no earlier flights. From now on I will avoid Southwest as much as possible."
"""very accommodating for a mistake I made""","Not Verified | Philadelphia to Orlando. Started off my trip by oversleeping and missing my flight. A staff member at the check bag area was able to work his magic and get me an alternate flight at no extra charge. Southwest was very accommodating for a mistake that I made. They went out of there way to make sure my vacation was not ruined. I am so thankful for their kindness and will now only be flying Southwest in the future."
"""the service was excellent""","Not Verified | My girlfriend and I flew to Orlando for a weeks vacation. We decided to book with Southwest as they don’t charge to check bags. Everything was great. When we had our layover in San Antonio we didn’t even have to get off the plane. WiFi is available for $8 and the 2 vodka sodas I had were $7 each, great price considering most bars on the ground charge more money. Both flights to and from Orlando were on time and the service was excellent."
"""not just a paycheck!""","✅ Trip Verified | There are plenty of airline choices out there, but the past few times we have chosen Southwest because of the hospitality, great rates, and fabulous customer service. That was until today. We purchased 2 round trip tickets to go to a wedding. A couple days after booking our trip, we decided we wanted to stay a day longer, and that we would update our reservation. The website clearly stated that changing our flight would make the reservation non-refundable. It instructed that we should instead, cancel our reservation, then make a new reservation, in case anything happened and we needed to make another change. So, we cancelled the initial reservation, and booked a new one. After a couple weeks, we hadn't seen the refund for our initial purchase. I called customer service and they informed me, that apparently I had purchased a non-refundable ticket initially, and wouldn't be refunded the $650 I paid. I advised them of what the website said, they acknowledged that my understanding of the instructions ws correct, but only for ""refundable"" tickets. Nowhere did it prompt me that I was cancelling a non-refundable ticket, and it wasn't clearly stated during my purchase that these were non-refundable. The only place it was made known to me was in the confirmation email and even then, it was in black font, it was in a pale gray font at the very bottom. The customer service agent advised it wasn't refundable and couldn't help me. She transferred me to her supervisor who again stuck by the non-refundable label. it wasn't as if I cancelled altogether. I bought another reservation for $50 more! But they felt the need to hide behind their ""policy"" and not take care of a customer, who in good faith, and by instruction of the website, did what they understood they were supposed to do. Instead of help me, the agent continued to reiterate that Southwest doesn't have many policies, but this was one and I was out of luck. I told her this was unacceptable and that the right thing to do would be to honor a refund as I was still purchasing a product, and got caught up in a technicality. She apologized ""that I felt that way"" and offered me a customer service number to call instead. Southwest advertises, and prides themselves on their excellent ""customer service"", but this is a pure exploitation of a technicality and not at all the way a customer should be treated. Even after admitting that the website tole me to cancel, they refused to be of any real assistance and expect me to pay $650 for absolutely nothing. If this is how they keep their ""low fares"", by exploiting fine print and taking advantage of customers, I want no part of them. This may be the last time I fly Southwest. Damn shame, because they used to be the premier customer service experience, but true colors are showing. You may pay more at other airlines, but at least they might treat you like a customer and not just a paycheck!"
"""rude and cranky""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt lake city to Houston via Oakland. All three flight attendants were rude and cranky. They didn't smile, were annoyed when you asked a question. Made the flight more uncomfortable than it already was."
"""worst experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Sacramento to Los Angeles. The worst experience ever with this airline! Other than being delayed, they change the time of flight when delayed but they don’t care that people change plans based on that. They end up flying whenever works for them without re updating! I have had a name change and had to update my account but not possible to do on the site or app. I called the customer service and was told I had to call headquarters. I called and left voicemail but they call back when it’s convenient for them and if you’re in the middle of work, that’s it! You’ve lost your chance! I went to the agent at airport and she said she Couldn’t change the account and that I have to email the headquarters. I emailed the headquarters a week ago and nothing got done about it. I ended up having to be patted down every time at the airport and due to that I get late. I fly lax-Sacramento every week and today as I was running after having been patted down to make it to my gate they called my name for the first time I heard my name being announced and while the guy was seeing me run he gave order to close doors. couldn’t change the account and that I have to email the headquarters. I emailed the headquarters a week ago and nothing was done about it. Today as I was running after being patted down to make it to my gate they called my name for the first time I heard my name being announced and while I was looking at guy at gate in disbelief and begging him to let me go in but of course he refused. Stay away from this airline if possible. They try to make up for their deficiencies by telling their stupid jokes. In reality, rude and robotic service."
"""Very professional""","Not Verified | Phoenix to Reno. Very professional, would recommend! I was able to change my flight information days before with no hassle. Kind and caring staff took care of my concerns. The flight was a bit delayed but that is not something that is controlled by the airline."
"""crew was extremely nice""","✅ Trip Verified | Was on the plane with 3 kids (1 year old, 3 year old, 8 year old) and had to detour to Austin due to storms in Houston. Landed and deboarded in Austin, then reboarded and sat in the heat only to be told we had to deboard again due to having to change flight crew because a pilot timed out. Had to wait for an hour for the new crew to arrive. We were supposed to land in Houston at 1:20pm, we landed in Houston at 7:40pm. The crew was extremely nice the whole time and then this morning I received an apology email and a $100 voucher for each of us. And did not even complain once. Thank you southwest!"
"""worst airline I’ve ever flown""","✅ Trip Verified | Cleveland to Tampa via Dallas Ft Worth. We were supposed to leave Cleveland at 5:35, we didn’t leave until 7:05. We had a connecting flight in Atlanta to go to Tampa. We were assured several times that we would make our connecting fights. When we were about halfway to Atlanta, we were told we would be arriving at 8:30 and that flights were being held, due to the fact that our flight was a connection for the majority of the passengers. When we landed, we discovered that none of the flights were held. We went to customer service and they booked us on the first flight the next morning. They didn’t offer any apologies, were very unsympathetic, and rude. They refused to comp a hotel, so I ended up staying at the airport with my 2 year old daughter, her first flight. Her car seat was checked as baggage, so I couldn’t leave the airport if I wanted too. This is the worst airline I’ve ever flown. I will never fly this airline again, I don’t recommend them for anyone else either."
"""Not impressed at all""","✅ Trip Verified | Portland to Nashville via Baltimore. I am disappointed in this airline and never going to fly with them again. In the past few years that I’ve flown with Southwest, 2/3 of my flights have been delayed. Today, they delayed my flight so much that I can not make my connecting flight. The placed me on one of the latest flights to get to my final destination. Instead of a four hour travel time, I am now looking at 9+ hours. They couldn’t even place me on a different airline for an earlier flight. Not impressed at all."
"""delay, delay and cancellations""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Dallas to Los Angeles. I never thought I would write a review about airlines because delays and cancellations are part of the flying experience and are out of control by the airlines sometimes. However. I am so fed up about Southwest’s delay, delay and cancellations. Southwest are not my preferred airline because of the airport location, but I do fly Southwest when I am traveling for business. I am almost sure there is at least a delay on every trip. Today, I’m finally sick and tired of it after a cancellation followed by four delays. I am never flying Southwest after this trip!"
"""I’m very disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Oakland to Orange County. 10 out of the 12 flights I had with Southwest Airlines in the past 5 months were delayed. I’m very disappointed since a chunk of my time goes to waste. I always fly out from Oakland to either SNA, Long Beach, or San Diego. I’ve been a loyal customer for 4.5 years because of its customer service experience and the 2 bags fly free on-going promotion. I don’t know how much longer I can give Southwest a “second chance”"
"""disappointed and disheartened""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Chicago. I am incredibly disappointed and disheartened by my most recent experience with Southwest Airlines. Let me preface this by saying that I have been flying Southwest for years, am an active rewards member, and currently have three upcoming trips already booked (booked before this experience). I flew out of Orlando, FL on Thursday night 5/24 at 9:15 on flight 1388 with my husband and 9 pound dog. We have flown multiple times with our dog in the past. I have always given our dog Melatonin to help her sleep while we fly (to avoid her ears popping/hurting). She was given Melatonin before boarding so she was already in her carrier as we boarded. We sat in our chosen aisle, me sitting closes to the window and my husband in the aisle seat so we could put our carry on bags in the middle seat while we got settled and I juggled two drinks. A flight attendant decided to approach us and say ""What's in the bag?"" to which my husband answered, ""a dog."" Terry then said, ""Okay, it needs to go under the seat."" No problem, we know that already so we said, ""Okay, we're just getting settled with our bags and will make sure to put her under."" He then came back I kid you not within one minute to proceed saying, ""The dog needs to go under the seat."" At this point we were getting a little upset. Once again my husband said, ""We know."" He then stayed right behind our seat while I gathered my sweater and tried putting my carry on away. I looked at my husband and mumbled, ""Gosh, can we put our seatbelts on?"" At that time, the FA very abrasively turned around, stepped into our aisle, and proceeded to yell at me saying, ""Yeah you can put your seatbelt on!"" I looked at him like a deer in headlights and said, ""Okay, I think you need to take it down."" He then stopped the rest of the passengers from boarding and continued yelling at me saying, ""Take what donw, tell me what I need to take down?"" By this point my husband and I were visibly upset. I again said, ""Take it down."" but again he continued to yell at me and say, ""I did nothing wrong!"" My husband said, ""Actually, you're yelling at us for no reason so you are wrong."" He was the most ill behaved employee I have ever encountered in customer service. Not one single flight attendant told him to walk away nor did they try to deescalate the situation. There were people recording this. Finally he stormed off. I began crying. The entire ordeal was disrespectful, disgusting, and completely unacceptable. I pay $95 dollars each way (just like every other person who flies with their pup) so by no means was any favor done for me to have my dog accommodated for. In addition, we have flown with her numerous times and have never had such a disgraceful and distasteful experience. I called Southwest to make a complaint and was able to speak to a very nice woman who unfortunately informed me that not much would be done. This complaint would get added to his file and the incident would be used as a ""coaching"" lesson. Basically, this individual's egregious conduct was endorsed by lack of follow through. I am beyond let down. I am in no way looking for this man to be terminated at all, but he does 100% owe both me and my husband a formal apology for his flagrant behavior and nothing is being done to rectify the situation appropriately."
"""horrible customer service""","❌ Not Verified | Newark to St. Louis. Southwest abandoned us in Newark. They cancelled out 7 pm flight at 10:30am and gave no reason. (She said ""well that happens sometimes, sir!). I should contact Southwest to reschedule. I did, no available flights out to St. Louis for the next 4 days. They said they could do nothing about it. On my own, I booked a SW flight to Chicago and then to St. Louis. Now they tell me they can't help out at all because it wasn't booked thru them! Truly horrible customer service! My son just experienced a similar situation flying out of Charlotte. Are they going down the tubes this fast?"
"""won't be flying again""","❌ Not Verified | San Antonio to Denver. Horrible customer service! How this company gets high customer service marks are beyond me. Staff at the front desk apparently don't like customers, or aren't well trained. I'm super excited to be flying an airline where the planes break down and the staff is lazy. I won't be flying again and will suggest everyone I know including my company avoid this airline. This system doesn't allow a zero rating so they get a 1."
"""Very unhappy customer""","❌ Not Verified | San Francisco to Raleigh Durham. This is the third vacation in 9 months where I have used Southwest and this will surely be my last. Each flight was either delayed or diverted. The first vacation flight added a stop after I had already booked my flight. The second vacation flight was diverted to Oakland instead of San Francisco. It was left to me to find a way to San Francisco for me and my family and, at my expense. The third flight (from San Francisco), was diverted to Pueblo Colorado to gas up when it encountered bad weather over Denver. This resulted in us missing our 5:30 p.m. connection to Raleigh Durham. We were rebooked onto a flight departing Denver at 11:00 a.m. the next morning. Southwest offered No accomodations to my son and me. Food, hotel accomodations, and transportation to and from the hotel was left for me to figure out and to exspense. Southwest has mastered the art of telling customers that they are sorry and there is nothing they can do; and, that they do not accommodate customers for bad weather because they cannot control the weather. Furthermore, trying to get any help from customer relations and airport supervisors has proven to be useless. Finally, there should always be someone higher up to call, even on holidays and weekends. Passengers should never be stranded at an airport and met with no solution or assistance from airline staff. Very unhappy customer. I would never recommend this airline to anyone and have them treated so poorly."
"""50% of Southwest flights delayed""","✅ Trip Verified | San Francisco to Las Vegas. Southwest plays a role of a different airline as they like to pose as a company offering benefits that others don't. It's partially true, they offer 2 complimentary bags to be checked and really cool prices. But hand in hand, they also tend to plan their flights on a lowcost schedule though they staff is far from the lowcost effectiveness. That is why their 40-minute-long stops in every destination fail to be fulfilled and major delays occur, frequently. At the day of our flight, at least 50% of Southwest flights was delayed, one, two, three hours, pretty common thing apparently. The plane is a standard B737 with nothing special to tell about. The service consists of a free non-alcoholic beverage (rather small portion with a lot of ice) and a mini bag of pretzels or peanuts. The staff was OK. Plus, their open seating policy (seat wherever you want) is really a terrible thing to offer if you are not a solo traveler. The reason is because the frequent flyers always benefit from priority boarding (and a lot of SW passengers do) and you are entitled to be in the second half of the boarded passengers. If you are not a solo passenger, you would probably end up split to multiple rows, because all the already boarded passengers with frequent flyer accounts are usually travelling alone and all of them like to seat on A, C, D and F seats, meaning when you enter the plane and you see almost empty seats B and E, but almost all A,C,D,F full, it's really pitiful view - again, this applies if you are a couple, family or a group of friends."
"""brand new bag was ruined""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Chicago. My brand new bag was ruined. I literally opened the box brand new the morning before my flight. It was a birthday gift, and after my flight that evening it looked like it had been dragged behind a luggage truck for a mile across the pavement. Since my flight arrived at 1am I was tired and figured no customer service would be open and would deal with it in the morning. Upon calling I was told by the women on the phone that you must bring the bag to the bag to be inspected within 4 hours of your flight to receive any sort of compensation for the damaged bag. I asked to talk with her manager. She told me she was the manager and would not let me speak with anyone else. This policy is ridiculous especially for flights arriving in the middle of the night, and I am incredibly dissatisfied with the customer service I received with this airline. Will not be flying with them again. I’ve attached photos of My two brand new bags next to each other (the smaller one I used as the carry-on) Rips that are all over the bag and wheels that are about ready to fall off at this point"
"""don't take vouchers from Southwest""","❌ Not Verified | Atlanta to Detroit. This is my husband and I first time flying with Southwest. Flying home internationally from Punta Cana, layover in Atlanta on 5/20; plane unable to land due to weather related issues. We were due to land at 6:55 pm and board a connecting flight at 10:05 to Detroit. At 7:08 pm, I got a text from SW that we were being re-booked to leave Monday at 4:00 pm. The plane I was on had to go to Orlando to refuel, and then back to Atlanta. We were on the plane from 2:30pm to 10:30pm, with no additional food, water, or drinks offered. Once in Atlanta, the customer service rep; re-iterated what I already knew, that we could not leave until Monday and gave us a voucher for a discount rate for a hotel. We booked the hotel (Holiday Express) in College Park, Ga, They don't take vouchers from Southwest only Delta and told us to go back to SW for a discount re-imbursement. I just finished talking to a customer rep in TX, who advises me that he could not help me with that issue and tells me how the airline is not responsible for Acts of God - I knew that, but my issue is with the hotel and the voucher. No further offerings of any kind or telephone numbers that I could take this issue further."
"""Absolute terrible experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Cabo to Houston. Absolute terrible experience traveling with Southwest Airlines. Not only did the flight take off late, but had to land in Corpus Christi because we didn’t have enough fuel to wait out a 5 minute storm coming into Houston. Ended up waiting nearly 2 hours on the tarmac in Corpus while waiting for 3 other planes to fuel up ahead of us. Complete waste of time and very disappointed in Southwest's choice to maximize profits by putting in the least fuel possible. Will never fly on this airline again and I encourage you not to either."
"""did not sit with my minor""","✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to El Paso via Las Vegas. I was boarding with my 13-year-old minor I asked him if we could sit together we were the last ones called they had my minor sitting in a spot where it says do not seat a minor under the state of California - yet she sat there from San Jose airport to El Paso airport. On our way home I asked in the flight we could sit together, again yet we were the last ones boarded and I did not get to sit with my minor again."
"""used to love Southwest Airlines""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Salt Lake City. I used to love Southwest Airlines, until now. Boarded a plane in Boston, then sat there for 90 minutes for mechanical problem. Missed connection so I was deplaned. Sat in line for 2.5 hours while missing all flights out of Boston. They literally took 45 min to rebook each customer - finally my turn, and they say I won't get home till 2:30 tomorrow, and I get a $200 voucher and hotel voucher in a roach motel 20 miles and $89 each way in cabs from the airport. Oh and my bags are on the way to Chicago. I have no clothes, toiletries, etc. and BTW, I'm on my own for food. Awesome, Southwest BOS!"
"""such a great attitude""","❌ Not Verified | Nashville to Chicago via Pittsburgh. Our flight to Pittsburgh from Chicago (flight 42) today had been delayed 3 hours, which we wouldn't leave Chicago until midnight and get in Pittsburgh until 2 am. The flight concierge at the desk B9 was so helpful, such a great attitude and got us a new flight and called the ramp to get our luggage off the old flight and onto the new one so we didn't lose them. She was having fun with us and making us calm. I am not impressed with Southwest but I'm so impressed with her."
"""very disappointed with Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Yesterday my husband and I had a flight from Austin to Jacksonville through Atlanta. When the flight out of Austin kept being delayed and reached 4.5 hours late because of weather in the area, we would miss the connection in Atlanta. They lady at the counter told us that meant they would cancel our fair and find an option to get us out the next day. We didn’t like that option, so we found a flight that got us to the Jax the same night through Dallas. That flight was also delayed because they were unable to track down the crew, and once boarded, we sat in line to take off. We finally took off only to be told they were not doing full service because of turbulence. All of that was unfortunate, but I understand Southwest hasn’t figured out how to control weather. When we landed in Dallas, we were told the original plan for those flying through to Jax on the same aircraft has changed and to deplane and check the monitors for our new gate. No Jacksonville flight existed out of Dallas. The flight to Jax we were supposed to be on had left hours ago! They purposefully left us behind. I quote Sean at the counter: “they ditched you to get the other people in the air.” I find this absolutely unacceptable. We should have never been allowed to come to Dallas after our flight had taken off. S The poor customer service continued has they refused to provide accommodations for us in Dallas because they blamed everything that happened on weather which they aren’t responsible for. When we pressed that sending us to Dallas was a mistake, the supervisor said it wasn’t; it was their bad weather plan. I explained again what happened in Austin - It was our plan to fly through Dallas but we were supposed to stay on our plane. And they said that they left hours ago because of weather so the mistake was because of weather. The bad day continued when we found out our bags had made it to Jax and were not in Dallas with us. So we had to find our own accommodations last night and will be rewearing our outfits as we hopefully get home on a flight to Jax today. If everything today goes according to plan, we will be landing 22 hours after we originally were. I am very disappointed with Southwest after yesterday."
"""flight is having a 2 hour delay""","✅ Trip Verified | Oakland to Orange County. Upon checking in, I received a text from them saying that our flight is having a 2 hour delay. Staff told me she doesn’t know about anything. I explained my situation to her saying I had an appointment to be there by 11:15am with the delayed flight I will not be able to make it and the appointment is what I am flying to SF for. She responded rudely and saying they had no other flights and I said how about other airlines if they could connect me to - they just didn’t help at all. I was panicking during the whole flight and hope that I would be ok. I got there late as expected but luckily I got what I need to get done. In the middle of it, they texted me saying my return flight will be 1 hour delay and then half hour later they texted me and said my flight got cancelled after all. I called and asked to put on later flights. They girl on the phone said we had no flight that day, but we have tomorrow. I told her I have no where to stay and asked if they are going to compensate my hotel room. She was like no but I could put you on a flight tomorrow! I said could you also check Oakland, she did and said we could connect you to the flight from Oakland to Arizona and Arizona to OC. I told her no, I wanted a direct flight and that’s what I paid for. She found one and that’s cool with me at least I have more time to explore the city. After checking in, they texted again and saying our flight will be an hour delay. Our flight was originally taking off at 8:25 and now 9:25. I asked the counter if they know they can’t land in OC after 11pm. The girl gave me bad attitude and said it’s the weather, we can promise you anything - and shortly after a customer service manager made an announcement saying they need to fix the plane in order to board u, they will leave us 10 mins to be boarded. If we can’t make it, the flight will be cancelled. Everything was great and started following direction and we closed the door at 9:30, took off about 9:42 and we landed just in time. I don’t know how they had no motivation for situation like this - if they delay or cancel people’s flights that they paid for, shouldn’t they give them free food vouchers or hotel rooms?"
"""attitude was terrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Albuquerque via San Antonio. While I have always liked flying SW in the past, I am now done with them. They are on my “No-Fly” list with United. Our return from Boston on 4/29/18 was perfect on paper, leave at 1:30, get in at 6:30. Checked in 24 hours early and got late “A” spots. Cool. Sunday morning received E-Mail from SW, flight rescheduled to leave at 3:15, 4 hour layover in Dallas then home after Midnight! Seriously!? So I called them. Woman very rude and difficult when I asked if there was anything better then getting in 6 hours late. She acted like this was my fault and she was doing me a favor by looking into it. Yes, there was a better option, getting us in at 8:30. (Why didn’t they put us on that in the first place?). Woman asked if I was sure I wanted this changed as SW would charge me if I called back. Wow. Really? Got to airport and had to check in with an agent. We were actually back on same numbered original flight out of Boston, just two hours late. She gave us “C” boarding passes. I showed her that we had “A” passes for that same flight. She said that since I rescheduled those were gone, but she could Sell us some “A” passes? Really? I never meant to reschedule anything. SW caused this. Possibly comp us A29 and A30 for their screwup? Nope. Wife and I sat in center seats in different rows for the four hour flight. SW used to be great. That is history. Their attitude back to me for their problems was terrible. Never again."
"""how understanding they were""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Saint Louis. I have only flown a handful of times in my life but this was my best and worst flight of them all! So the pilot that flew our plane did the smoothest take off and landing I have experienced yet. The speaking flight attendant was entertaining and made people laugh, all while still being professional. Now for the horrible part - right before I boarded the plane I started to feel ill. Let’s just say the bathroom was smaller than a broom closet (hey it’s a plane what do ya expect?!) I asked the attendants for something to help nausea and other things. - they got right on it! They let me stand back by them so I could stay close to the bathroom. They nurtured my stomach with ginger ale and water. They were so very understanding, they didn’t seem annoyed or inconvenienced., it blew my mind away how understanding they were! Which I guess you would rather someone chill in the back than vomiting all over the plane. I did not catch their names but I was on flight 1734 from Vegas to Saint Lois May 17th 2018. These employees deserve recognition for their actions!"
"""Extremely disappointed""","✅ Trip Verified | Washington to Chicago. Extremely disappointed with the airport team at check in and boarding. Rude, unfriendly and after money. Flight delayed and no attempt to put me on an earlier flight as standby unless I pay another 300 dollars even though the earlier flight had room. The clerk would not even check for space or finish the conversation. This is the first and the last time on this airline."
"""I asked to be upgraded""","✅ Trip Verified | I wanted to reach out regarding the unprofessional service I received from southwest employees. Travel was from St. Louis, MO - Dallas, TX AND Dallas, TX - Birmingham, AL. My flight was delayed last night, then cancelled. I called the customer service number to inquiry about other flights. The agent booked my 3rd option as the first two were taken. I asked for my seat position to be upgraded to “A” because of the inconvenience of staying another night in St. Louis. I also asked for a flight voucher for a complimentary flight which is normal practice on other airlines. The customer service agent declined both request, however informed me that at the airport the customer service department will accommodate in person with no problem. I spoke to the supervisor who was very rude to me. I was only asking to be accommodated for my inconvenience. Professionalism goes a long way and this did not happen today. I am currently in seat position “C”. My main request was to be upgraded to “A” or my previous position of “B”. The supervisor did express that i can pay for it. She said she will not upgrade me because she doesn’t want to not because she can’t."
"""their system wouldn't allow it""","❌ Not Verified | Baltimore to San Diego. Southwest would not add TSA Pre check to my ticket. I stood in a full service line to check my bags and add TSA Pre check with my global entry card. They told me that TSA Pre check would not print on my ticket because I already flew under the reservation. I find it ridiculous their system wouldn't allow it. It's not the fault of the person checking me in (although, another separate problem was they were under staffed). Whoever designed their check in system did not build this feature in."
"""Take a real airline""","❌ Not Verified | Houston Hobby to Midland. I just spent half an hour waiting at the desk because they said I could upgrade my boarding priority. They finally get to me and it’s oh never mind there aren’t any left. Love standing there for 30 minutes for no reason. I usually take United out intercontinental airport. Now I remember why. You get an assigned seat and you don’t stand there like an idiot waiting for nothing. Southwest is a very similar experience to Spirit airlines. Save yourself the grief. Take a real airline."
"""the absolute worst experience""","❌ Not Verified | I had booked this trip from Denver to Las Vegas five months ago. I had booked this as a surprise for my best friend as a bachelorette/Birthday party. This was a $700.00 surprise. We were on flight 799 from Denver to Vegas at 5:25AM. Landed in Vegas at about 6am Vegas time. We go to get our baggage and only one bag arrived. We submitted a report at 6:40am for the lost bag. Throughout the morning as we waited for a ""15 minute "" call back, no one called us, no one updated me, and no one can tell me where the bag is! We are now sitting in Vegas and the person/reason for being here has none of her things! Not only does she not have her things,her fiancé hid a surprise card with money in it. It is now 9:30am the next day and they still can't find my friends bag nor did they call me. I called them again to get no new information. This has been the absolute worst experience. When we were getting on the plane to come home they offered someone a $600 travel voucher for their next flight if they changed flights because they oversold it. We are now back from our trip and they still can’t find the bag. We are not even allowed to start the process of reimbursement until after 5 days."
"""don't want to fly Southwest again""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Chicago. Arrived at check in and received a message on the ticketing machine that the flight was cancelled due to weather in Chicago, even though my party in Chicago said there were no weather issues there, especially when I was supposed to have been landing, and every other flight continued to Chicago within a short timeframe. (Later, I checked my messages, and they had sent notification of the flight cancellation while I was on the bus from park and ride to the airport just minutes before.) I had arrived for check in two hours before my flight, but Southwest couldn't find any flight with any connections in the entire country except one that got me there five hours later. I asked to be put on standby on an earlier flight and was told that I was #3, but when I showed up to the earlier flight, I was told that I had been bumped down to #7 because I wasn't an ""A lister"". When I objected and said they had lied to me by not telling me the whole truth, I was told that I better calm down or I wouldn't be allowed to fly at all. I was also listed as the very last person to get a seat on the later flight even though I had a much better boarding number on my original flight. Finally, because I complained, they removed me from the TSA pre check for my returning flight. If it was a weather issue, why didn't they just keep our plane on the ground, and let us all take off on hour or so later? When the flight was cancelled in the morning, I had asked to be put on another airline since they couldn't get me on anything earlier on Southwest, and they said that that wasn't required when it was a weather issue. I think it was a profit issue for the airline, not a weather issue. They gave me vouchers, but I don't want to fly Southwest ever again. I wanted to be at a special dinner with my son and daughter-in-law which I missed thanks to Southwest."
"""took care of my needs""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Denver. I just flew Southwest to go visit my family and I traveled on my own with my first baby who was 3 months old and Southwest was amazing to me about it. They were accommodating and when flying home my suitcase had ripped open and I lost a few items from the hole in my suitcase and working with the Southwest customer service I have never been so greatly treated. They were fast, cared, and took care of my needs."
"""would absolutely consider Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time flying Southwest from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. I found that, for the savvy flyer, Southwest really isn't any worse than economy on a legacy carrier, especially with their new basic economy classes. Just be sure to check-in quickly and arrive promptly for boarding and you're guaranteed an aisle or window seat. There was only one hiccup on my flight, during boarding. The sole gate agent was responsible for getting 2 wheelchair-bound passengers onto the plane, which took a significant amount of time. Overall, though, I would absolutely consider Southwest when it makes sense financially."
"""no one wants to help you""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Burlington. I finished up with a convention much earlier than anticipated and decided to head to the airport to try and get my ticket changed to an earlier flight. There are flights going from Las Vegas, NV to Burbank, CA about every hour. I find out there are open seats on every flight throughout the day and Southwest refused to help me. They only wanted to sell me another ticket. I declined that option, as I already purchased one. Of course, this is the case with all airlines now - no one wants to help you because of the corporate greed. Well, I’ll do my part by not flying with an airline that clearly doesn’t care about anything other than money."
"""It felt like a brush-off""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Kansas City. We had a very troubling experience with my 6-year-old son flying as an unaccompanied minor on Southwest. He was bumped (although he had a confirmed seat) in favor of standby passengers. Southwest says it was because he didn't have a boarding pass, which apparently can happen even if you check in at the ticketing counter with an actual person who has you sign all the Unaccompanied Minor paperwork and gives both you and your child documentation to go through the security checkpoint. It wasn't a boarding pass! When I called Southwest to get my son onto a different flight, they put him as ""standby"" on a flight going out on Monday morning -- two days later -- and waived the $260 ""change fee."" I called back, asking if he could fly out from a different airport the next day (instead of two days) and they said he could, but I'd have to pay the ""change fee."" They said nobody with the authority to waive the ""change fee"" would be in the customer relations office until Monday morning (the day my son was scheduled to fly as a standby passenger.) Ultimately, I went on Facebook and made a public post. This got results. Southwest changed my son's ticket to a different city so he could depart the next day, with a confirmed seat, and without a ""change fee."" (Kind of proves that there was somebody in the office who had the authority to waive the ""change fee"" at the time they told me I'd have to wait until Monday to talk to someone with that authority.) Then, Southwest didn't answer a bunch of specific questions like, ""What time was my son's confirmed ticket released so that a standby passenger could board?"" and, ""What protocol did the gate agent follow to contact my son's guardians when the gate agent realized that an unaccompanied minor who had checked in at the ticketing desk had not yet picked up his boarding pass?"" In Facebook message, Southwest representatives sent me copies of their ""Unaccompanied Minors"" page of guidelines from their website. They were trying to prove that my son had forfeited his confirmed seat by failing to arrive on time. In fact, the ""Unaccompanied Minors"" page links to another Southwest website page called ""suggested airport arrival times"" which says only that passengers should arrive at the Ft. Lauderdale 60 minutes early for domestic flights. When I pointed out that my son had met these requirements (although NOT the more stringent time requirements being described after the fact by the customer service representative) the Southwest representative wrote, ""I certainly regret if the information your family relied on was not the information provided on the specific Unaccompanied Minor page."" No, ma'am, it was linked on the Unaccompanied Minor page, and there was no other information on the Unaccompanied Minor page. Basically, Southwest representatives bumped my son out of his confirmed seat. Then, they lied to me by saying nobody with the authority to waive the ""change fee"" was available to help me reschedule his flight until Monday. Then, they blamed my family for not following arrival guidelines that were not actually published, and told me that the guidelines we followed (from their public website!) were the wrong ones. Ultimately, the customer service representative told me she had no further information for me, and that she had assigned me a ""file reference number"" to use if I needed to contact their Executive Office. It felt like a brush-off, rather than a real effort to help."
"""Flight attendant was late""","✅ Trip Verified | Newark to Orlando. Flight attendant was late, every 20 min they said another 20 min, been standing in line for an hour and a half because they kept saying another 20 min, now they said 30 min longer. The crew could care less, worse airline i do not recomend it."
"""done using them to fly around the USA""","✅ Trip Verified | I left from New Orleans to get to Dallas for a meeting two and half hours before the meeting started. There was a delay in New Orleans, which by the time we left I would have arrived at the meeting with thirty minutes to spare. Once we get in Dallas they made us wait on the plane for 30 minutes, which made me late to the meeting. This is not the first time this has happened with this company, and I am done using them to fly around the USA."
"""Seat was already given away""","✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Portland. Arrived within the rescheduled time frame. Seat was already given away. Extremely disappointed. Will not recommend for future flights. Southwest personnel were not willing to recognize mistakes within notification system. Conscience of Southwest not worth the unconvincing of flight reschedule."
"""always a good experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Ft Myers to Houston via Indianapolis. Southwest Airlines is excellent. My eleven year old Shih Tzu dog has flown 42 times, and it’s always a good experience with no hassle travel on new planes. Whenever we have to fly United, there is always a problem of some sort. Thank You Southwest for not charging bag fees, and sending a new plane with decent people to deal with. It truly is a pleasure."
"""couldn't care less""","✅ Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas via Austin. We didn't take off until nearly 8pm after numerous apologies from the Captain and providing false information that we had been cleared for takeoff, according to him since at least 7pm. Nonetheless, we missed our connection flight by 20 minutes thanks to the Captain who didn't attempt to contact Austin about the delay. So, we approached the agent at Austin who contacted the Supervisor who was also helpless and she informed us that we could either rent a room, wait at the airport til the next morning and leave on flight 655 on Wed the 21st at 7:10am boarding time. So, we went back to the agent and managed to obtain boarding group ""C"" tickets with ""EXTRA TIME"" highlighted which means we board after group ""A"" & before group ""B"". We had boarding group ""A"" throughout our entire trip and this was of course our first ever time traveling Southwest Airlines and should I mention any else. We were stranded at Austin Airport for more than 10 hours and also a young lady with her 3 year old daughter who had to be in Reno and also missed her 1st connection in Austin. What puzzles me and leaves me flabbergasted is how Southwest Airlines who doesn't care about leaving passengers stranded, couldn't care less if you ever travel with them, are not transparent and have poor customer service. It all comes down to one thing, you get what you paid for."
"""kindness shown to us""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Orlando. I was in Las Vegas on vacation and had severe back pain and difficulty walking. I contacted Southwest Airlines customer service to request a date change in my itinerary to return home early. Thanks to the agent in Chicago she was able to move my return flight up five days earlier and had a wheelchair waiting for me at the Southwest Airlines curb check in at no additional cost for me and my wife. They took the time to change our schedule and get us home ASAP. I'll never forget the kindness shown to us by Southwest Airline personnel at the gate in Las Vegas and in Orlando. I was the first one in the 737 and the first one pushed off board. The fact that they care and accommodated our needs was absolutely outstanding."
"""Very bad experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Recently I had to to travel from Phoenix to SF for work meeting. A day before my trip I got an email that my flight is canceled. I had call them and reschedule. There was a 40 minutes delay at the airport. As for the return flight, there was a stop at LAX. The flight was 45 minutes delayed. After boarding they made us wait in the plane another 45 minutes. Initially in the ticket there was no change of plane at LAX however we had to change our plane due to unscheduled plan.. again we had to wait after boarding fir another 40 minutes before takeoff. In general it was an exhausting trip with many unplanned events! Very bad experience."
"""flight crew were all excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | Albany to Baltimore. We had a great experience flying Southwest. We will always choose Southwest airlines when flying. Not only are they already great because they give you two free bags +2 carry-ons not to mention if you’re a family you may board the aircraft first. But, my family and I had to change our flight out on the way home at the last minute after going through security. The staff member at the customer service desk made it seamless and bumped us to another flight that same day in no time and at no extra charge! Once on the flight the crew were funny and kind and very accommodating to my one-year-old who was very fidgety! When we arrived in Albany all of our luggage was in the baggage claim waiting for us! It had arrived on the original plane we were supposed to take. There were two SW employees standing with our luggage and even helped us carry it out to our shuttle bus as we had two children in tow. I cannot say enough good things about this airline. All of the employees from the beginning when talking on the phone boarding our flight to the employees checking our bags to the flight crew were all excellent!"
"""consistent in their product""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Austin. When I have to fly coach, I prefer Southwest. They are like MC Donald's. Not gourmet, but very consistent in their product. Standard check in with 3 checked bags for the two of us. Early bird check in got us B6 and 7. Typical Southwest boarding, I find quick and efficient. While I guess, I would prefer a seat assignment, Early Bird check in works great for me. We lucked out and got a aisle seat and a window, with the middle seat empty. Good legroom, as usually a little better than most. I find the new seats actually a little more comfortable. Nice flight attendants, a couple rounds of drinks, I brought a sandwich with me. 2 hrs and 15 minutes and we were home. Bags off quick. Another very satisfactory Southwest trip."
"""my bag soaked to the core""","✅ Trip Verified | Tampa to Atlanta. Being 4 hours late isn't a big problem, but arriving with my bag soaked to the core is. Everything wet, including the Band Aids in my toiletries kit. This is the second time this has happened to me on Southwest Airlines. You would think that a major airline would have figured out how to keep their client's baggage dry."
"""extend my sincerest gratitude""","✅ Trip Verified | Raleigh to Phoenix. I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to everyone at Southwest Airlines. I was on emergency leave to go see my grandma as she is very sick and not expected to live much longer. My mother in law made the reservations for me as I was in the field on a training exercise. She made the mistake of booking my return flight back late which would have had severe consequences for me. She called and spoke with a wonderful representative and explained what happened. The representative was able to fix everything and get me on a flight back so I can report back to my unit with a day to spare! My flight out to AZ was amazing. I had never flown Southwest until now. My mother in law made me a believer and I will fly Southwest unless you don’t fly where I need to go. Again I can’t thank you enough."
"""a total inconvenience for us""","✅ Trip Verified | Horrible experience with Southwest Airlines! We were rerouted to a different flight and as we were getting on we were told the overhead bins were full so they made us check our carry on. So I checked before sitting down and there was room in multiple overhead bins. Laziness on the crew members part and a total inconvenience for us as passengers. If you have a choice I would use a different airline. I was not impressed to say the least."
"""huge thank you for helping""","✅ Trip Verified | Chicago to San Antonio. I would like to give the agent a huge thank you for helping me change my flight last minute. My wife and I were in Chicago for the Cubs opening game on Monday 4-9. It was postponed for 4-10 due to weather. Although we already had our flights for 4-10. As soon as we found out we called Southwest to rebook. Since I used my points to book the original flight I was unable to change flights without buying an entire flight. We also couldn’t reuse the tickets to the game to any other game. So we had to either watch the game or try and sell the baseball tickets. It was our first ever opening day. The agent helped me and gave me a one time courtesy flight for Wednesday and we were able to go to the game and still make it back home on time for work. I couldn’t thank him enough! I appreciate Southwest for doing this. We are back home and we had an excellent time."
"""condescending bag check employees""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Raleigh. This review concerns the bag check employees at the Orlando international airport mco for this airline. I brought my bag and baggage claim check ticket to the counter to be checked. The attendant insisted I put the sticker tag on my bag myself even though my hands were full and there was a huge line behind me. When I accidentally dropped all my things he became annoyed and demanded I pick them up, as if I’d leave it them there. He then was displeased with how I applied the sticker. I said I’m sorry I don’t normally do this. He said that’s why I’m showing you how. However, that’s not my job, that’s his job. I’m not working right now. He was so condescending and rude, it left me feeling terrible. Beyond that, a similar incident happened last time at this airport for this airline at the bag check. Everything else about this airline is great. It’s not worth it to lose customers because of rude condescending bag check employees. Customer service should probably be a bit more important."
"""staff was extremely rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Midland via Dallas. Our flight was delayed over an hour last night which i have no issue with because things happen. However, the doors to the plane were still open, and after repeated requests from most of the passengers, the staff would tell us nothing of why exactly we were stalled so badly that a lot of us feared something was fishy, sketchy etc. Babies were screaming because they hadn't eaten in hours but mom's were not allowed to go and get them food even though we sat there for a very long time. They wouldn't allow passengers to get up and use the restroom until we pretty much said we were going to just go everywhere. The staff was extremely rude and didn't communicate to anyone why we were being delayed again, which is their job. I overheard multiple families saying aloud ""this is why you don't fly Southwest"". Nor I or any member of my family will fly Southwest again!"
"""cancelled at the last minute""","✅ Trip Verified | We booked our flights to and from NYC through Southwest. On the day we flew into the city, our flight was delayed over 4 hours and then completely cancelled at the last minute. We had to rebook with American Airlines on the spot as Southwest had absolutely nothing that would help us. They provided us with a $200 flight voucher, but that was nothing compared to the $800 tickets we had to purchase on the spot at the airport to be able to arrive in NYC in time. Today we are flying back, and our flight has just been delayed 2 hours, therefore causing us to miss our connection flight. When I called customer service, the woman on the phone was rude, inconsiderate, sarcastic, and very unhelpful. After 20 minutes on the phone, she provided us with a few other options, but all of them would be much at our expense - which was completely unprofessional due to the fact that the airline was the one causing the problems. We were left with no choice other than to stick with our flight and figure out what we are going to do at the airport. Hopefully we will not be stranded in our connection city. Do not fly Southwest."
"""lack of empathy provided""","✅ Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Providenciales. I am extremely upset on the level of customer service, communication, and lack of empathy provided by Southwest. It’s disappointing to speak to a multi million dollar company who has the ability to make changes over $99 who opts not to. I purchased a ticket in June to travel from FLL to PLS (Turks and Caicos) on November 9th. After Hurricane Irma and the destruction of rental property, I was encouraged to contact Southwest in September and explain my situation. The representative reassured me that I would be able to have a travel credit due to the weather and cancellation of my trip. She explained to me that I have one year to use my voucher. Here today, I am trying to use my travel credit by Southwest to go to my graduation, and to me disappointed I cannot use my credit for travel for me and dad. After communicating with Southwest it was explained to me that ""Unused travel funds may only be applied toward the purchase of future travel for the individual named on the ticket."" This however was not explained to me when my trip was cancelled or I would have choose the option to receive a refund. I have explained my case to two representatives with Southwest. The last person I spoke with stated that I has three options (1)lose my travel credit (2) take off $100 off my credit, which the reminding balance then could be used on both travelers or the best one yet (3) Have my commander write a letter stating that I will unable to use the flight credit because I may be called to drill?"
"""Nice job, Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Got violently ill this morning, just as my group was called to board. Southwest Airlines staffer across from gate B20 at 9 am canceled my flight, alerted gate, rebooked me, identified closest hotel and gave me voucher for distressed customer rate, which Crowne Plaza honored. Nice job, Southwest. I'm going to keep flying where staff steps up and helps a customer in a fix."
"""customer service is appalling""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to San Juan. The customer service is appalling. I booked a flight of over $500 to go to San Juan. When I get to the airport they say they are stopping in Atlanta. I ask why and to review my itinerary. The lady was rude. Then I shrug it off and go to my connecting flight on New Orleans to only be told that I will be going back to Atlanta for a another stop. Why am I on a plane to go to Atlanta twice! I called and the agent was arguing with me that it was the flight pattern when I have my itinerary on my app showing it is not. Nothing was done to accommodate or rectify they extra travel back to the same place - and now my flight is delayed over 3 hours."
"""in the airport for another 5 hours ""","✅ Trip Verified | New Orleans to San Antonio via Houston. Flight was a few minutes late leaving New Orleans. Touched down in Houston at 2.20pm. Connect flight scheduled to leave Houston at 2.30pm. Would not let me board because we were too late getting in even though the connecting flight was delayed until 2.55pm. So now, they have me sitting in the airport for another 5 hours for a 1 hour flight. I asked if I could catch something earlier. I was nice about it. Staff was rude."
"""they have lost all of my respect""","✅ Trip Verified | Just an FYI for everyone. They will give away your seat if you were not at the gate 20 minutes prior to flying. I know the general rule is to be at the airport two hours early, sometimes this is not possible with connecting flights. Southwest gave away my seat on the flight that I paid for, they told me I can get on the flight three hours later and wait at the airport. I was at the gate 18 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time, they told me it was too late they had already given away my seat. I fly Southwest twice a month for work. I don’t really have an option so I will continue to use them, however they have lost all of my respect, and if another option comes available I will make a change. Very disappointing."
"""Not the customer service of the past""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Southwest Airlines from Las Vegas to Dallas. Not the customer service of the past. I was at the gate with no announcements. They sold my ticket as I went to board and said I was too late. I was put on standby rotation out of Vegas and no seats were available because all flights were supposedly sold out for the day. This was the reoccurring message until I purchased another $1000s in tickets for the next day. Then and only then did they find openings to multiple direct flights out the same day. What a racket. No seats. Sell my seat. Buy another ticket. Then oh look there are seats."
"""Southwest Airlines lied""","✅ Trip Verified | Southwest Airlines lied for reasons I’m sure are related to not compensating individuals. They use the excuse of weather related issues. I know for a fact that March 20th, 9.20 am flight was canceled, while the rest of the day flights left Denver bound for BWI and BWI to Denver went on until 10.20pm. They then canceled my next flight at the same time, 9.20am the next day 1 hour later. Needless to say I spent two days in a hotel next to Denver airport. I spent over $700 for hotel, food, rental, parking, they hide behind the fact that they can say it was weather related, so they do not have to compensate anyone. I do not like liars, I will never use this airline again."
"""Staff were nice""","✅ Trip Verified | First time travelling with Southwest Airlines from Santa Ana to Houston. Online check-in in advance and everything else is processed super fast. What I love most about this airline is that they allow 2 pieces of checked baggage. I know that there are no seat choices and I have no problems with it. If you are in one of the last groups boarding, only midde seats are available. Staff were nice and had a great sense of humour."
"""I think I will rent a car""","✅ Trip Verified | Left KC for Philadelphia via STL, on time, sat by the runway for 10 minutes then returned to the gate because of a bad pressure reading. Maintenance took care of the problem and we were on our way. Delay caused us to miss our connection to Philly by 5 minutes. So a great counter agent in STL, got us on a plane to Chicago after a 3 hr wait so we could get on a plane to Philly. So, on to Chicago. Arrived in Chicago and onto the plane after 2 more hrs wait. Onboard plane, waited nearly another hour for a customer running late for a connecting flight. Kinda like my flight from KC was late. After almost an hour, customer never showed. So thankfully, Southwest Airlines decided it was time to get their plane in the air. We arrived 13.5 hours later and 8 hrs late. So you would think nothing could go wrong on the scheduled return of Philly to STL to KC. Supposed to leave at 1.30 pm now leaving at 5pm. And to thank us for flying, they have given us an extra flight. Since we will now miss the flight to KC, Southwest has given us an all expenses paid flight to Chicago to catch a flight to KC. This will put us in KC at 12.20 am. 7 hrs late. I think I will rent a car in STL and drive 4 hours to home. $120 broker but in bed 3 hours sooner and 2 less flights."
"""staff were terrific""","✅ Trip Verified | Mexico City to Boston via Houston. Our Mexico City experience wasn't too great! We were NOT informed about a change of flight departure, so arrived in time, but the flight was an hour earlier. When the airline personnel finally came to the desk, they helpful as far as they could be and got us on the next flight. However, in Houston, the staff were terrific! Got us a hotel, a meal ticket and onto a good flight the next morning. They went out of their way to help us and I want to thank them. We had not flown Southwest before, and I'm glad we did this time."
"""Continue to be impressed""","✅ Trip Verified | Continue to be impressed by Southwest. Boarding process is straight forward and smooth. Those who give negative reviews about the boarding process should have reviewed this before booking a flight. It is well known in the industry that Southwest doesn't do assigned seats. If you don't like it, don't complain or don't fly Southwest. Anyway, the cabin staff are great and always in a fun and good mood with the passengers. All Southwest planes are the same regardless of route so carrying on is no hassle. Flights may be a tad more expensive than the others but you do get 2 free checked bags if you wish, plus their service is the best between the big airlines. I will continue to fly Southwest time and time again."
"""customer service was helpful""","✅ Trip Verified | We were originally scheduled to fly from Denver to San Antonio via Houston Hobby, but our first leg was delayed, which meant we were not able to connect to our second leg on time. Despite flying on Christmas Eve, customer service was excellent in dealing with our issue. We only had to go to one counter and the lady was extremely efficient in helping change our tickets. She was able to squeeze us onto a direct flight to Austin that was leaving within 10 minutes of visiting the service desk. Our baggage ended up on the original flights, but customer service was helpful over the phone in retrieving our baggage. It's one thing for an airline to fly you from point A to point B, but it's a whole other ballgame when airlines need to troubleshoot in times of trouble. In this particular instance, Southwest pulled through and I was impressed."
"""worst flying experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Phoenix. The worst flying experience ever. 3 hr late in 45 min fly. Disrespectful employees. When I asked the counter person how come 3hr late The answer was ""do you want to go to Phoenix or not"" After three hr late and sending me from one gate to another. I was frustrated and I complained, the answer was the same ""do you want to go to Phoenix or not"" this time from different person."
"""Avoid Southwest at all costs""","✅ Trip Verified | Minneapolis to Phoenix. Terrible, awful, not enough words to describe the ridiculous boarding process. Do not fly this airline if you want to sit next to your travel mate because you will end up in a middle seat every single time. Extremely rude staff at every turn - in the terminal was the worst.Even the flight crew was rude. I fly Alaska Airlines regularly and love it! Avoid Southwest at all costs."
"""Do not pay for early bird seating""","✅ Trip Verified | Albany to Denver. This company rips you off with no remorse. Do not pay for early bird seating. $15 per person gets you nothing more then booking a regular economy ticket and they refuse to refund the money or give drink vouchers or anything. It is a very deciving upgrade they use to make extra money. The woman on the phone was very rude and I will never take this airline again and I dont recommend you do. This experience shows corporate greed to a tee."
"""Southwest Airlines has stopped caring""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Las Vegas to Kansas City. Another flight at night time, another 2 plus hours delay. They just apologize like it’s no big deal, the problem is when you travel as often as I do you can see how often these flights are delayed. Especially the last one going from Vegas to Kansas City Airport. Anyone can look up this information but just in case you’re wondering, tonight’s flight is WN5915, 03/17/18. Also when the plane did arrive, it arrived at the wrong gate which led to further delays and if you were using your Southwest app as your boarding pass, you probably lost your boarding pass since the app thought the flight had already departed (you can’t make this stuff up), meaning you would need a paper boarding pass and leave your A spot! Addendum: they had a bad exit sign which meant clearing the passengers out and doing paperwork to fix it, which has led to another 20 min more delay. I wish there was an alternative carrier flying this route, Southwest Airlines has stopped caring."
"""one of the best flights""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Los Angeles. The flight attendants were very kind and very helpful. They made our flight much easier and nicer with their humor and very nice attitudes. The pilot landed the plane smoothly. It was one of the best flights. Five stars flight."
"""Absolutely Horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | Detroit to Atlanta. Absolutely Horrible. Flight was cancelled for a reason that “has yet to be determined” with no notice or knowledge of flight being cancelled until I got to the terminal? No accommodations were made to get me to my destination. I was stuck on their airplane for 12 hours to get to my destination. Flight attendants were snobby. Friend also flew Southwest and met me at our destination and on his return home, his flight was delayed. Save yourself a headache and fly anywhere but Southwest."
"""Great staff""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Detroit. Great staff. Lost glasses on flight. They helped look for them. Checked on us many times. Flight was smooth and drinks and snacks. We're right on time. I have never flown Southwest before and upset I didn't. Keep up the amazing job."
"""blown away by the service""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Oklahoma City. The ladies at the check-in counter for Southwest Airlines in Las Vegas on the evening of 3/7/18 are incredible! Their was an issue with some baggage and I was blown away by the service they provided me in getting me to my destination with my baggage. They were polite and without a doubt went above and beyond. This is why I love Southwest Airlines! Thank you."
"""a bad day made worse by bad attitudes""","✅ Trip Verified | Used to be a great airline, been flying Southwest since 1989 but what a disappointment. Lied about the reason for the delay, no accommodation for rescheduling, didn’t post the new departure time once we got to Chicago. Didn’t honor the fees we paid for early boarding. Just a bad day made worse by bad attitudes. Sorry Southwest I will book elsewhere in the future"
"""seems to be the norm now""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Houston to Omaha. This is my third flight in 3 months on Southwest and each time, the flight is on time during boarding and then they wait 45 min to an hour for people on connecting flights causing everyone else to be late on their arrivals. People with connecting flights miss them because someone else who is late gets to hold others up. I can see 5-10 min, but not an hour. Southwest has never held a flight for me when my flights come in late due to weather. Why are some passengers more important? I needed to get home on time tonight and that didn’t happen. This seems to be the norm now. Southwest should examine this policy and realize how many people they are inconveniencing. I had to spend the night at the airport in December. No fun!"
"""I will recommend all day long""","✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Washington DCA. After Spirit made a mistake with their app check-in, and the flight was non-refundable, I came to their counter bawling my eyes out. I had no idea what to do. I had to get to DC this morning (I have a visa appointment this afternoon) and only had so much I that could spend. The gentleman and lady behind the counter will never know what they meant to me this morning. Not only did they help me to find the soonest and cheapest flight possible, but they almost made sure it was as close to the embassy as possible. I cannot, in any way, express how appreciative I am to them. Once I compete my return flight with Spirit, I will not be flying with them again (something I have never said about an airline). Southwest, however, I will recommend all day long."
"""do not pay for early boarding""","✅ Trip Verified | St Louis Dallas. The airline itself is not too bad. However, don't waste your money on early bird boarding. I purchased it from STL to DAL and ended up with B25 which you can get without paying extra. B25 is not early boarding, A1 through 60 will board first then 24 more people. So, by their definition being the 85th person to board is early bird. I called customer service and they explained to me that they just keep selling the early bird boarding no matter what it gets up to. No guarantee you will get in the A group. I feel like this is a dishonest business practice and somewhat deceptive. People assume if they're paying extra they will actually be getting on the plane sooner than most. Bottom line, do not pay for early boarding as it's pretty much a scam to make more money."
"""likely the best airline in the US""","✅ Trip Verified | Austin to Chicago. Southwest is great at its best, middling at its worst. There are quite a few places where Southwest blows all of its American competition out of the water. No change fees, no cancellation fees, and no baggage fees. This is not found anywhere else in the US. The fares themselves are typically cheaper than other airlines, especially if booked at least one month early. Otherwise, fares are average. Customer service is quite good and the free drinks and snacks are satisfactory in today’s age. And finally, the seats on all of their planes have good legroom. One of the few negatives seems to be their increasing rate of cancellations in the past year. I’ve experienced three cancelled flights since last August, which is concerning. However, that’s not always within the airline’s control. Overall, Southwest is most likely the best airline in the US."
"""a horrifying experience""","✅ Trip Verified | I had a flight with Southwest Airlines from Chicago to Orlando. The flight was cancelled at the last moment by Southwest. It was December 29th 2017. Being peak season and no other available flight, me and my family were left stranded. I was somehow able to reach Orlando by taking another airlines and flew back from Orlando to Chicago with Southwest. I requested for a refund of the amount for the cancelled flight from Chicago to Orlando. After 5 calls and 2 months Southwest only provided me a partial refund and fails to give me an explanation for the partial refund. The customer care representatives are very nice and keep on apologizing to me for not providing me with the right refund amount but fail to provide the complete refund. Every time I call I am put on hold for at least 1 hour for them to look in the matter and talk to the refund department. It has been a horrifying experience. I just hope they do not treat other passengers in the same way."
"""not worth losing a day of my time""","✅ Trip Verified | We were scheduled to fly Dallas to Boston, non-stop at 11.15am, got a delayed flight notice at 9.40am of a 2 hr delay. When I inquired why, the gate attendant said ‘air traffic control hold’. I checked and there were no holds in place. After 2 hrs waiting, the gate attendant informs us the broken door repair could not be completed (eg confirming what I suspected was a previous lie re: ATC hold). A replacement plane is being flown in from Milwaukee so we now have another 2 hr delay. Some guests got upset and attendant basically told everyone that ours was the only flight to Boston so we would either have be patient or wait until tomorrow at our own expense, seriously not feeling the love or transparency. I realize cost savings with Southwest Airlines is not worth losing a day of my time. Looking to go back to American Airlines for all my future flights to Dallas."
"""going to announce a delay""","✅ Trip Verified | Nashville to Milwaukee. This last trip was just another reason why I should not deviate from my current provider. Stewardess was not forthcoming about how many seat were available staying they were booked full and grab the first seat available. So I did, big mistake as plenty of seats were still open in the back. I get to Nashville and had to then ask at our scheduled time of departure what was going on. They said we are going to announce a delay. Obviously! When I asked what was t he cause of the delay, no answer was given. I asked again and made it a little more clear. Is the delay caused by weather or mechanical. Reluctantly she said mechanical. Typically this is where the professional representative at the counter offers to make amends for the company causing the 1.5hr delay making my arrival after midnight. Not only was i not offered any miles or meal ticket, I was give a get away from my desk look."
"""Save an entire row or more""","✅ Trip Verified | New Orleans to Dallas. Just found out today, it’s okay to save seats On Southwest Airlines. No worries about your low boarding pass, just get one person to check in and get an A pass, and then go save seats for everyone! Save an entire row or more it’s okay, just know the flight attendant will back you up. No worries about others (even if they paid for Early Bird Checkin), you can now save seats on Southwest."
"""Customer service is outstanding""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Southwest Airlines from Denver to Portland. Customer service is outstanding. I had to change my flight from last night to this morning. I spent 6 min. on the phone and spent $0 for changing. They are so good to work with. Flight experience was great, the staff very helpful! Other airlines do not even compare."
"""I may be heading back to Delta""","✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Atlanta. This trip was my first Southwest experience. Flying to Las Vegas was great, staff was friendly, plane was clean, got a great position (A30) to board and select a seat. I paid the additional fee for early check in both ways, and having booked my trip 3 months in advance, I was pleased with my position on the way and expected the same going home. Unfortunately, when it was time to check in for my flight home, I found my position was completely unsatisfactory, B22. I called Southwest to see if there was an error and was told that sometimes it just falls out that way. My issue is that if Southwest is going to take my money for early check in, there should be a guarantee for zone A boarding, OR give me an alert so I know what I’m paying for if I choose to continue. Surely if their system can assign boarding positions as flights are booked, it can alert customers when zone A is full, right? Sad to say I may be heading back to Delta after this. Drink carts and assigned seats may be worth the money after all."
"""experience has been hard and horrible""","✅ Trip Verified | I moved from Chicago to Las Vegas. They lost two of my luggage that was filled to capacity with all of my clothes.Luckily everything of my Children’s made it to Las Vegas. Now I have flown with Southwest plenty of times, but I never traveled with majority of my belongings. Any other time I had no problems but this moving experience has been hard and horrible so far thanks to Southwest Airlines."
"extra $150 round trip just to bring my bike""","✅ Trip Verified | Portland to San Francisco. The people are friendly. However, they charge for bikes. I had my bike exactly 64” which is under most airlines’ requirement of under 65”. Southwest has a max of 62”. I will not be flying this airline anymore, because it is impossible to get a bike under these dimensions unless its a folding bike. If you ride bikes seriously, take Alaska. They allow one bike FREE and have reasonable maximum dimensions I could even use a hard case. As it is, I will be paying an extra $150 round trip just to bring my bike. Ridiculous."
"""I left my coat on the plane""","✅ Trip Verified | Last week I flew from San Jose to Phoenix on a Southwest flight at 3:45 in the afternoon. When we got off the plane in Las Vegas I left my coat on the plane. We immediately tried to call to find out what we needed to do and figured we should probably go to the baggage claim area where the Southwest office was. We went there and of course there was no coat. We filled all the information out and have heard nothing. It's a shame that someone from Southwest would take my coat. It didn't make it a few hundred yards from the plane to the baggage claim office where the lost-and-found was. Lots of losers in this world."
"""flights are held for all connecting flights""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Southwest Airlines from Chicago to Hartford. Return flights are held for all connecting flights as a standard practice! This is my 5th time taking the last flight out from Chicago where they have delayed my flight so all connections coming in can make theirs. The rule here is dont plan on leaving when you expect to because you won’t. You will only leave when every passenger is accounted for - however many hours that takes! Last time I had to wait 3 hours! I paid to leave at 9pm not some arbritrary time that Southwest decides at its convenience. I will never fly out of Midway again."
"""she refused and was extremely rude""","✅ Trip Verified | Orlando to Puerto Rico. Traveling with my family, wife son (9) daughter (13) went to sit in the exit row because my kids wanted to sit back themselves in the row behind us (not an exit row and my kids fly several time a year by themselves). We paid for early bird check in so we could choose our seat, and we done this several times before never being questioned. We were not allowed this because the flight attendant made a judgement call that in an emergency my wife and I would be conflicted and help our kids before performing our duty of opening the exit door. Even after explaining what the situation was, she refused and was extremely rude. Definitely not what I have come to expect from Southwest. I love having my judgement questioned by a complete stranger. We also checked their exit row policy and no where does it say anything about this."
"""SWA's torture seating""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Atlanta. This was the first time for me, luckily, to fly on one of the planes with the ""upgraded"" seats. Never again. In fact, I may never fly SWA again unless I absolutely have to. These new ""seats"" have pencil-thin ""arm rests"", without padding, meant to discourgage people from using them - and that design works: if you don't mind elbowing your neighbor, you'll get bruised from the ""arm rest"". The shoulder / arm area is thinner than normal, and unlike the older seat design, even very thin people, such as myself and the passenger on my one side, will be bashing elbows and rubbing legs when constantly shifting positions to try and get away from the constant pain of the seats. See, the seats have no padding. NONE. They seem to be made out of cardboard. There is not just no lumbar support or seat padding: it's shaped oddly the opposite that seating for humans dictates: the lumbar region of the seat goes back rather than forward toward your back, and the seat curves up at the part right under your upper-upper thigh (the seats are also the shortest depth of all seats). While you are hunching your shoulders forward to avoid being shoulder to shoulder with strangers, you have to bring your elbows in front of your chest and hold them there, while your lumbar region is being pushed into an outward curve by the back of the torture seat and your legs have circulation being cut off by the upward curve of the seat edge. After 30 years of flying only SWA for all domestic flights - 8+ in the past 8 months - I will not be flying with them again unless absolutely necessary. This flight was yesterday, and I am experiencing moderate neck, back, and leg pain as a direct result of SWA's torture seating."
"""There is no customer service""","✅ Trip Verified | Sacramento to Phoenix. So disappointed and won’t fly Southwest Airlines again! Customer service in Dallas is horrible. Actually that’s a contradiction. There is no customer service. Just beware, if you have a scheduling or booking problem, Southwest Airlines obviously treats customers as though customer is always wrong, they are always right and extremely inflexible. I have been disappointed with Southwest Airlines experiences in the past and flown them again, my bad. Never again. Why do the cattle call and rush to seats - I’ll travel a better airline with much better service."
"""This day was an absolute nightmare""","✅ Trip Verified | This day was an absolute nightmare. So excited to go to Orlando. As usual, we made sure we were at the airport nice and early. Then, received multiple text notifications that the flight was delayed/on time/delayed/on time. Our flight was supposed to be at 12.55. It was then changed to 1.15. When it got close it was delayed to 4.20. It was then changed to 6.00pm. We are now boarding the airplane and it is 7.00. We have been at the airport since 11.00am. We waited 8 hours and after boarding it will be 9 hours. Absolutely ridiculous and ruined our first day of our trip."
"""What a serious disappointment""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew Southwest Airlines from Tampa, Florida to Philadelphia. What a serious disappointment! First my flight was canceled not once but three times. Then I paid for early boarding and when they cancelled my flight that got cancelled. I specifically asked for it back the lady told me I did not need it because I qualified for family boarding. I told her to make sure she assured us that I would not be placed in the back. That was a lie. I spent the whole day at the airport with my 6 year old with no accommodation then to find out after I finally reached my destination that my bags did not arrive and I received them the following day! With some of my items missing and luggage ripped! Bad first time flying with Southwest, never again!"
"""no longer fly with Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Los Angeles. The Denver Southwest agent just told me our flight at 10:15pm is delayed by 1 hour and 15 minutes to 11:30pm because we are waiting for a couple of passengers to arrive from another delayed flight. Our plane and the crew are here waiting - Southwest is making all the passengers on this flight 75 mins late just for a couple of other people. I have never known this to happen before with any airline and it's not okay. I have got A list status from flying with Southwest so much last year but I will no longer fly with Southwest because this is totally unfair and I'll now switch to Delta."
"""I'd rather drive""","✅ Trip Verified | I am currently on flight #5823 from Birmingham to San Diego via Las Vegas. The date is January 8 2018. The flight departed at 11.10 am. The only female attendant on the plane is very rude. My 11 month old son was overheating and needed a diaper change. I was at the back of the plane and had to navigate my way to the front of the plane, where for some reason the only changing table is located. The bathroom was occupied. So I was perfectly OK with waiting the few seconds it would take for the bathroom to open up. The woman turned, saw me and without even asking if I needed anything or was OK, snapped, ""you know you can't wait here. You've got to go back to your seat."" I told her we had just gotten up there and that this bathroom was the only one with a changing table. She didn't care so I had to go all the way to the back of the plane and change my son on the pull down tray, which is disgusting for me and the other passengers. As if that wasn't humiliating enough, the woman proceeds to get on the intercom as I'm walking back to my seat to announce (apparently for the millionth time. Her attitude knows no bounds) that no one is allowed to wait at the bathrooms. I have flown Southwest many times, and enjoyed it. Lines have formed many times and it wasn't an issue. But this woman's behavior is unacceptable. My son was overheating and needed a change, yet I basically was not allowed to use the only lavatory on the plane that had a changing table. I have flown many other airlines and none of them were as good as Southwest, but due to this experience, I don't think I will ever fly again. I'd rather drive than put up with this kind of treatment."
"""had my dog without proper documentation""","✅ Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Nashville. I travel with my emotional support dog for anxiety / other mental health issues. I have flown with him through Southwest before & had absolutely no issue. I have an ID card for him that shows he’s registered and that I’m his owner. I was supposed to fly out at 6pm today with my dog, but the supervisor and staff at the MKE airport wouldn’t allow me to check my baggage or fly because I had my dog without “proper documentation.” I showed them on Southwest.com it says employees may not ask for “proof of disability”, then in a later paragraph claims the customer needs a doctors note. When I registered my dog as a service animal I was told that all you need is the ID card. I missed my flight and will now be paying a pet fee and flying at 4am instead of 6pm."
"""provided excellent service""","✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Ft. Lauderdale. During the flight the cabin attendant provided excellent service, with a smile and fully in the holiday spirit. On this same flight, there was an emergency in the aft cabin section that required attention of all attendants. Attendants kept everyone calm and were most professional in the manner she explained the emergency. As luck would have it, on the return segment from Baltimore to Ft. Lauderdale on December 31 the same attendant was again the cabin attendant on this flight. As departure time approached, the captain informed there was a maintenance issue with the aircraft. The attendant set an orderly pace for passengers to disembark, relocate to another gate, and re-board. I have flown SWA several times monthly for many years (including the time when segment credits were awarded instead of distance/cost points) and believe Southwest earns its wings, each and every flight."
"""tonight they let me down""","✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Las Vegas. Southwest has always done an impeccable job and tonight they let me down. There were 60 (max) people on our flight and then back 2 bathrooms were “frozen”. I sat in the back and had to use the restroom but they kept telling me it was closed. Finally, I used it. The flight attendants understood and I apologized but they weren’t having it. This was the first time I felt like Southwest wasn’t for the customer. Which I know it’s stupid but I had to use the bathroom and they told me I couldn’t."
"""best airline experience ever""","✅ Trip Verified | Buffalo to Orlando. Best airline ever! Flight attendants were the friendliest and the pilots amazing! My special needs granddaughter was able to get her picture taken with the pilot. The front flight attendant had a great sense of humour and was a very caring person! I would never hesitate to recommend Southwest Airline. Honestly, best airline experience ever!"
"""Southwest is a terrible airline""","✅ Trip Verified | From Atlanta to Las Vegas, this Southwest flight was delayed 3 hours and now, from Houston to Atlanta, another Southwest flight is going to delay approximately 2 hours. Southwest is a terrible airline."
"""totally disappointed with Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Rochester to Baltimore. Southwest was one hour late out of Rochester my getting to Baltimore late. We ran to the gate and and the ticket agent scanned our tickets Got a beep and the ticket agent said to go to ticket counter for new tickets ? Went to ticket counter and they gave our seats away “thinking we would be late”. The southwest ticket counter agents were very rude and said we will get you out tomorrow and you will need to sleep in the airport (meaning 14 hours) - we are both 67 years old. Their supervisor was very rude and didn't care to hear anything I had to say. They said we were on our own even after admitting they messed up. After two hours of talking back and forth they reluctantly set up hotel accommodations. My wife and I fly Southwest all the time and even have a companion pass. I am totally disappointed with Southwest and their ticket agents in Baltimore"
"""Absolutely awful experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Houston. Absolutely awful experience on Southwest. Flew 12/23 and massive snowstorm hits Denver. Roads getting to airport blocked, hundreds of people unable to reach airport late at night so I called Southwest enroute to state I would not be able to make flight and to rebook for next day. No one picked up on hold for 20 minutes so purchased a separate one way ticket for next morning so I could spend Christmas with family. Sent an email requesting them not to cancel return ticket since I would definitely still use it. On arrival the next morning was told my return ticket was cancelled since I was a “no show” for my original flight. Argued and pleaded with agents on phone and at airport to reinstate reservation and told basically “no way” and it was my fault for not cancelling the outbound flight. Explained again that I tried to call and sent an email and was told to “not be argumentative” but the very rude representative on phone. Have 1K on United and travel Southwest when schedule suits it but never again- they just don’t care."
"""expect additional delay""","✅ Trip Verified | Tampa Bay to Chicago. Constant delays, on top of their estimates for delays expect additional delay time. Subpar food and snacks, tiny drinks. As far as flight attendants go these people were not as pleasant as Delta or American. The boarding process is also annoying pain."
"""our airline of choice""","✅ Trip Verified | Reno to Las Vegas return. I fly this route about 3 or so times a year and have always had good service from Southwest. Reno airport is a breeze to go through. The ground staff is friendly with smiles even at 5 a.m., security is quick and then you are at the gate. Had a 6 a.m. departure time which we pushed back from the gate right at, a quick de-icing and off we were. Cabin crew cheerful, the captain gave us updates during the short hour flight. Watched a beautiful sunrise and then we were in Vegas. Only minus was how hard the pilot landed the plane in Vegas. That for sure woke everyone up. Coming home our plane was delayed 20 minutes, then 40 minutes and then finally an hour. We were updated plenty of times with apologies and the reason for the delay. It was all good and we pushed back an hour late but within 5 minutes we were up in the air. Was very windy weather so the takeoff had plenty of ups and downs with bumps and thumps but again the captain kept us informed and said once we get up in altitude all would smooth out. And it did. A quick beverage service, some peanuts and an hour later we were back in Reno. Southwest always delivers a good product and is our airline of choice when flying in the West. Also enjoyed the free wifi using the Southwest app. Not a ton of choices but good enough."
"""were so pleasant and kind""","❎ Not Verified | Houston to St. Louis via Pensacola. I don't normally take time out to write a review but this is worth it. The flight attendants on this particular day were so pleasant and kind that I had to write a review and say thank you. Not every day people treat you this well and it always seems to be the negative things that we all focus on. Everyone wants to complain about everything, always and I have zero complaints about this flight. They were funny and very accommodating towards everyone."
"""Very disappointed in Southwest""","✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Phoenix. Very disappointed in Southwest Airlines. I fly at round trip at least once a month with Southwest and I am usually very happy with the airline overall. However, I recently had a trip scheduled to go from Phoenix to LA, LA to Denver and Denver back to Phoenix. My client in Denver had to reschedule our meeting and my admin bought a new one way ticket for me to get back to LA from Phoenix and she also bought a new round trip to go to Denver the following week. Unfortunately, she forgot to cancel one of my initial flights (Denver back to Phoenix) and it was not until I received an email notification from Southwest that I realized the flight had never been cancelled. I immediately called Southwest (was on hold for 27 minutes) and explained the situation. I was hopeful that due to my loyalty and this one time oversight, Southwest would at least issue me a credit toward another future flight. That was not the case. It was explained to me that there was nothing they could do. I think it is time for me to find a new airline. One that will be at least a ""little"" flexible with me when a simple mistake is made."
"""I don’t recommend it""","❎ Not Verified | Flew Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. It was the worst flight experience I have ever been through. The staff, especially the person boarding passengers was very disrespectful. I had a handicap father I was boarding with and the man did not let me go in with him, when I was seated for group B they did not let me get seated until group C. I will never fly with this Southwest Airlines again and I don’t recommend it for those who will fly with family."
"""never taking Southwest again""","✅ Trip Verified | Philadelphia to Orange County. Southwest used to be good. I would have given them 5 stars back in the days. Now they suck and are plain rude. I just had a call with customer service and the “customer service” guy literally said “ok that is all” and did not even say thank you for using Southwest or any of their usual end call thank yous. I was the one that actually said ok, have a good night. I at least have basic manners, yet I’m not the one working the customer service job. Hello? If you’re working customer service shouldnt you at least read the end call thank yous? Isn’t it your job and basic manners to say at least a thank you for choosing southwest. I'm definitely never taking Southwest again. Just plain rude."
"""incredible act of kindness""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Austin. The cabin crew were amazing. They were funny, polite, attentive, kind and actually seemed to enjoy their job. The pilot went above and beyond his duty after the plane landed. I was traveling alone with a baby and a 3 year old. My 3 year old fell asleep on the flight. Since I didn't have a stroller at the gate the pilot carried him all the way to baggage claim for me. What an incredible act of kindness!"
"""the cabin crew did not assist""","✅ Verified Review | Las Vegas to Washington. Tiffany is my daughter and the cabin crew did not assist her with her guitar and where to place this. This is my daughters first time flying and we had informed the lady at the check in and she assured me that she will be assisted. As she can tell that I was really concerned. When my daughter landed in Washington she was practically in tears because no one helped her with the guitar. She was embarrassed because a lot of people were looking at her and even the cabin crew. I am so upset that Southwest cabin crew didn't care and just stood there and looked at her."
"""delayed and the service was awful""","✅ Verified Review | Las Vegas to Orlando. This was my first time flying with Southwest and my last! My flight was delayed by an hour and the service was awful. I did not understand the cattle call for seating and counter person didn’t explain the process well enough. On my departing flight from Las Vegas the agent at the gate was so very rude! He appeared to be upset and snapped at several people. I’m so disappointed in my flight experience with Southwest!"
"""brand new bag has been ruined""","✅ Verified Review | San Francisco to Denver. Normally, I would say that I love southwest. However, this is the second time in two months my luggage has been damaged. The first time, it was replaced for 60% of the original value, I was given a garbage bag for my items and sent on my way to find new luggage. Today, 3 weeks later the new luggage I purchased was damaged (handle and wheels). Now, I can’t wheel it straight or get the handle to come up. When I brought it to the service counter I was told that Southwest does nothing for handles and wheels. Meaning, my brand new bag has been ruined and I’m stuck with nothing. Very disappointing."
"""No reason was given""","✅ Verified Review | Due to fly San Jose to Santa Ana. Southwest sent me an email very late last night stating that they have changed my upcoming flight by 2.5 hours. No reason was given. They also did not call me to discuss the consequences of this to me. I wrote to their customer service and they replied that previously they would call the affected customer to discuss alternatives. Now they only state that I can cancel and get a refund ""If I do not like their change"". I asked for early boarding on the affected flight and their reply to that was absolutely no."
"""the experience was very smooth""","✅ Verified Review | The Southwest Terminal at LAX was decorated for Cinco de Mayo and the airline staff were in a festive mood. I used full-service check-in at both LAX and DAL, and the experience was very smooth. The Southwest Airlines ground staff in L.A, San Antonio, and Dallas were very friendly and helpful while tagging the baby stroller at the boarding gate. Southwest let us board the plane early since we were traveling with little kids. The on-board experience was also good. While disembarking, Southwest staff brought the baby stroller to the Jet Bridge in a timely fashion. Southwest Airlines is the most family-friendly airline I have flown on."
""" flight attendant was hilarious""","✅ Verified Review | Orlando to Indianapolis. I have started flying a lot for work and my recent Southwest Airlines flight was the best one yet! The flight attendant was hilarious. The only reason it's not a 10 is because Southwest Airlines doesn't work well with my companies travel set up. (Most of you won't have to deal with this though). Good work Southwest airlines!!"
"""will never fly Southwest again""","✅ Verified Review | Las Vegas to Santa Ana. I’ve been a faithful Southwest flier for years and the last 5 times I’ve flown with them something has gone wrong. First they are always delayed and never running on time. The next time I fly with them they broke my new suitcase that had been checked. Now this time they cancelled my flight and didn’t tell me until I was at the gate. Leaving me with a 3 hour lay over and I should have been in California by 10:30 and I’ve been stuck in Vegas until 11 not getting to my destination for hours after I had planned. I understand weather can be an issue. But there is no excuse when the weather is clear and people are depending on being on time. I am cancelling my Southwest visa and will never fly Southwest again. It’s not that hard to be on time"
"""They refuse to reimburse""","✅ Verified Review | Laguardia to Minneapolis via St. Louis. The first leg of our flight for unknown reasons (first they said unknown, then weather, then air traffic control issues). The flight was delayed 2 hours. We were notified 3 hours prior to original departure and immediately contacted customer service because we would miss our connecting flight home. We were told that There were no available flights to get us home from either our departure city, our connection city, or a near by airport we offered to drive to. We actually had a service agent say, ""It's not my problem. What do you want me to do? I can't invent a flight for you."" The next flight they could get us home on was in 2 days!! We were stranded. We had to get home for my husband's cancer treatment. After hours of frustrating conversations with ""customer service"", We purchased a hotel room for the evening and flights out for our family of 3 on another carrier. Have had 4 conversations with customer service vice agents via phone, a very insulting email from the airline and a frustrating Twitter exchange. The message is consistent. They refuse to reimburse, they are not responsible for missed connections due to delays, and they refuse to transfer to supervisors or give information to contact anyone higher than the call center. Horrible experience."
"""dissatisfied with customer service""","✅ Verified Review | San Diego to El Paso. Southwest has officially lost all business and thousands of dollars a year from someone who used to be a loyal customer. My mother has been very sick and I had to fly back home to El Paso TX to be by her side. I’ve also had to push my flight back more than a few times cause I just can’t leave her in this state. The last change somehow changed my flight to the same day, same time. Instead of the next day. They were able to look it up but still unwilling to do anything about it. They said their no show policy states there has to be an attempt to cancel the flight. Why would someone first their flight to the same exact date and time. Next if you were sure that it was for the next day why would you attempt to cancel it. I am so dissatisfied with their customer service!"
"""legroom was amazing""","✅ Verified Review | My wife and I are travelling around the US for the first time from Australia. We were unsure of the local airlines and relied on mixed reviews. We flew Southwest from San Francisco to Orlando and Washington DC to New York and were amazed at the quality of service. The check in system is easy and efficient. the staff keep you posted at the departure gate on how to line up and how many people are on the flight. The system of no reserved seats appears daunting but somehow it works really well. Once on the plane the cleanliness was surprisingly good, the legroom was amazing as I am 6'5 and my wife 6' and the friendliness of the staff was as good as we have ever seen. Southwest Airlines will be my first choice for all future flights and I hope they maintain the high standards they currently have."
"""Very cheap move""","✅ Verified Review | Cancun to Baltimore. On a way home our flight was #1612 and I agree with customers who had not pleasant experience with flight attentents. We had a few coupons for free drinks and decided to use it on a way home because it was my husband birthday. I ordered Bloody Mary. My drink was amazing. I received a can of mix, packet of species and a bottle of vodka. I had over ice and had to add it to my plastic cup again to finish all liquid. My husband called a few times our flight attended to order more drinks for him. Then we heard unnecessary comment "" don't you think it's too much of jack Daniels?"" Maybe it was a joke but we paid for our drinks and it doesn't say how many drinks you can have. We are over 50 years old and I don't think those comments were appropriate. Our""neighbor heard about celebrating birthday and decided to join us with her friend. She also ordered Bloody Mary. For our surprise light attendant brought her plastic cup with ice and already premixed drink. We were schocked. This lady saw me having like total of 2 cups versus one that she got. What happened to other part of vodka and mix of Bloody Mary? Are you guys trying to get $5/drink and split it for 2 people? Not cool at all. Very cheap move. I like Southwest, never had problems but this incident ruined my opinion about that. Unfortunately it's only airline we have to use to get to Cancun and its very fast. I'll try to order my drink in a future just to check if you will improve but how unsanitary is to biting unopened drinks."
"""they're unethical to charge you""","✅ Verified Review | St Louis to Atlanta. I have been flying Southwest because they're cheap. The thing they upsell you on is boarding order. For my flight on 9/26 I purchased ""Business Select"" (and paid more for it) for flight 426 so I could get priority boarding. When it came time to board the gate agent allowed everyone to board in whatever order they wanted regardless of their boarding number. I had A-1 but because the gate agent said people could board in whatever order people pushed past me to board first. I asked the gate agent what was going on and why we're not boarding in order. He said to just get on the plane. Once on the plane I asked the lead flight attendant what was going on and she said the flight was light so just take a seat. I contacted Southwest's customer service web page and filled out a complaint. I got a response from a ""no-reply"" email saying sorry but that they would do anything including not refunding the cost for the business select boarding they didn't deliver. My opinion of Southwest Airlines is they're unethical to charge you for something and not deliver, and then not even care. Southwest is not just a shabby airline, they are in my opinion scam artists."
"""Would not fly here again""","✅ Verified Review | New York to Dallas. Would not fly here again. They notified my hours before my flight by text message saying that they had cancelled my flight and didn't say why so I called and the gentleman said it was because of weather. So I tried rescheduling a flight since my brothers wedding was the next day but they didn't have anything left. So I was told to go to the airport which was 2 hours away and see if I could get on a flight but they just ignored me and said the fastest they could get me out was Monday and the wedding was Saturday. They were super rude and didn't care what happened to me after I stood there 2 hours to talk to someone. I ended up having to spend $500 on a flight out instead of the $150 flight I had booked months ago. It was horrible I have never been through something so stressful in my life."
"""flight delayed on both my trips""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Milwaukee via St. Louis. The flight itself was okay, but the flight was delayed on both my trip out and my trip back home. Very little info was shared about why and the delay out of St. Louis back to Seattle was extensive due to staffing issues. Unacceptable. You should not have to call in staff last minute. We had to wait for staff twice because the first back-up never showed. It seems every time I fly with this airline, there is a delay. I don't have this problem with other airlines and I don't know that I will fly Southwest again."
"""absolute worst experience""","✅ Verified Review | Chicago Midway to Phoenix. I set up a vacation for my wife to go see her best friend in Arizona, this is her first time flying. Her flight was scheduled to leave from Midway airport In Chicago at 11:15am. We got there a couple hours early, got through checkout and thought we were good to go! 40 minutes before she's supposed to board, the flight got delayed and was now scheduled to leave at 1:35pm. We left to get some food and was back at the gate by 12:45. They then delay the flight to 2:35. Then just minutes later they cancel the flight! Went to the counter to ask what to do. They told us as long as the ticket had today's date we can go to terminal B17 and catch that flight. So we go to B17 and they informed us that was wrong and that they were ""probably just trying to get us through the line"". We then had to go stand in a different line, which we waited in that line for an hour and a half and in that time only went half way. I finally go up to the terminal attendant to ask him what we can do. He again said we need to wait in that line in hopes of being put on standby. Luckily a pilot overheard him and asked me what was going on. So I explained the story and he kindly went behind the desk and told them to change her over to that flight! I thought we were home free, but I was mistaken. He told her that instead of being a direct flight like the original flight I booked her, there would be a layover in Oakland. He said she wouldn't have to leave the plane when they go there. She called me in Oakland saying they forced her off the plane and since the pilot had the ticket she didn't have a ticket to show the attendant who was rude. So she got off the plane and tried explaining to the attendant what happened. The attendant told her ""to bad cause you don't have a ticket"". My wife went up to the counter panicking. The woman made a few calls and almost an hour later was able to get her on the flight to Phoenix. In Phoenix she was supposed to be picking up a rental car from Advantage (I purchased everything through southwest.com) and when I called to verify the car they said there wasn't a reservation. When I called to ask Southwest, they said they don't rent through Advantage. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they confirmed they do in fact rent through Advantage. Something apparently happened in processing the rental car so now her friend has to drive to Phoenix to pick her up. This was the absolute worst experience with Southwest."
"""will not fly Southwest again""","✅ Verified Review | Chicago to Providence. I am not a fan of Southwest airlines. Even though they offer a lot of freebies. The seating is open seating. There is no way to actually pick a seat. When you purchase your ticket you are given A,B or C and you just board when your info is called, but you cannot choose which one you want when booking your ticket. It is terrible. I will not fly Southwest again. I was traveling with my spouse and we couldn't even sit together. Everyone who boarded ahead of us took window and aisle seat."
"""you've ruined this trip""","✅ Verified Review | Montego Bay to Baltimore. Southwest was always my preferred airline. However after this experience I am appalled by the way this situation was handled. An air traffic control tower was struck by lightning on 9/8/2017 in Jamaica. We were suppose to leave on 9/9/2017. Obviously this wasn't an option, completely understandable. But the tower was fixed late night on 9/9/2017. As we talk to others that were forced to stay at the resort ($450 a night) with us their airlines Delta, American, United, etc. were understanding and scheduled extra flights to help out and get them home to their families. But Southwests' answer to us is to bad we aren't sending extra flights forcing us to spend an extra $2000+ on a room and missing out on being paid at work. Southwests' answer is you're staying until Wednesday 9/13/2017. I guess I had the wrong assumption of this airline and stand corrected. Way to go Southwest (as sarcastic as I can be here) you've ruined this trip for my family."
"""staff on this aircraft were wonderful""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Sacramento to San Diego with Southwest. The staff on this aircraft were wonderful! They were all so friendly, and gave excellent service. From loading all the way to unloading. They made me feel so comfortable! Thank you for making my flight so enjoyable!"
"""absolutely ruined my experience""","✅ Verified Review | Chicago to Las Vegas. Our row was completely missed to get drink order. When the flight attendant came around to drop drinks/snacks off to other rows we asked for a drink. We got an eye roll from the flight attendant after our entire row was completely awake yet again missed in the drink order. The gentleman aside from myself and my boy friend as rudely spoken to accusing him of being asleep which he was not. My boy friend also got a drink and while the attendant did seem preoccupied with attending to other guests on the flight my boy friend gently reminded him we ordered drinks, which was followed by a rude comment and loud embarrassing response from the attendant on just how may people were on the flight and we had to wait. We would have not had said anything if he didn't seem completely dismissive with our request. I understand they are busy but the attendant's responsive was just rude. This was my first trip with southwestern and the flight started off fantastic with the attendant making jokes and my previous flight before the lay over was seamless and fantastic. This absolutely ruined my experience with Southwestern on how rude the attendant was."
"""more than satisfactory""","✅ Verified Review | I was unable to fly from Nashville to Dallas because of the hurricane in Texas. Southwest staff bent over backwards to help me and the outcome has been more than satisfactory. I feel very grateful for the standard of customer service."
"""because we are not liable""","✅ Verified Review | Salt Lake City to Albuquerque. Extremely upset with the service of Southwest. I am a freelance makeup artist and have to fly sometimes for jobs. Have never had a problem with Southwest until now. I check my makeup kit due to the fact I have a lot of liquids and can't have it as a carry on. I had them put a fragile sticker on just as a precaution because I packed it well and it should have been fine. I opened my kit once I get on site for my job and everything is shattered. I was reassured by numerous Southwest incident associates that since the damage was extensive and puts me out of a job I should be reimbursed. Going through months of trying to get my case looked at and have to deny jobs due to the fact my equipment is ruined they finally got back to me. ""Unfortunately we will not be reimbursing you because we are not liable. Here's a voucher for your next flight"" Thanks for putting me out hundred of dollars, putting me out of a job, oh! But thanks for the voucher."
"""both flights were delayed""","✅ Verified Review | This is the second time in as many months that I have tried to fly Southwest from Burbank to Salt Lake City. Both flights were delayed a significant amount of time and no notice until 30 minutes before scheduled departure. I asked an agent if it would be okay to leave so that I didn't have to sit in the airport for 2.5 hours. He said he wouldn't advise it because the departure time can change again. When I asked if any of the times they put up mean anything he said ""yes!"" Obviously didn't get my sarcasm. When I asked why my flights keep getting delayed his only response was ""it's the nature of the business."" If that is the case, why do we have departure times at all? If this had been a one time scenario I could understand, but this seems to be happening more and more. Do not trust this airline to fly on time more than about 20% of their flights. That seems to be my average."
"""cancelled due to thunderstorms ""","✅ Verified Review | Atlanta to Dallas Love Field. Our frustrating and unexpectantly expensive situation with Southwest Airlines began on Sunday August 6th 2017 after having spent a wonderful weekend in Georgia at Ft. Benning to celebrate our son’s graduation from Boot Camp. Our group consisted of our son’s 3 parents and 1 elderly grandmother who needs physical assistance getting around. Ready to head to the Atlanta airport to catch our flight (2419) back to Dallas Love Field, we received an elctronic message stating that our flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms over Dallas. We called home (Dallas) to check with our house sitter and other friends to hear what the weather was like. They said there were no storms at all. It was clear skies and very hot. I checked my weather app and saw no storms in the DFW area. We called Southwest customer service who said we could spend the night in a hotel in Atlanta and catch a flight to Dallas the next morning. But we needed to get back to work the next morning (a Monday). We asked for reimbursement for the 4 tickets we will need to by from other airlines. SWA Rep said we would need to call Customer Relations. But a refund is not possible since the cancellation was due to weather! When we arrived at the Atlanta airport we ran to the American Airlines ticket window and bought the last 2 AA tickets flying to DFW that evening for $536.40! AA ticket counter rep told us all flights to Dallas and DFW airports were flying with no weather issues. So we let our son’s mother and elderly grandmother have these 2 tickets since we were not sure there would be any other available flights out that night. Then we ran to the other end of the terminal to the Delta ticket counter. We bought 2 tickets to DFW for $654.32! Delta also confirmed no weather issues flying into the DFW area. The total for 4 tickets including terminal fees cost us $1,217.72! I called SWA Customer Relations the next day to inquire about a refund for the 4 tickets we had to purchase due to the SWA cancellation. We spoke to SWA Customer Relations rep at the corporate office in Dallas TX. He said no refund is given when a cancellation is made due to weather. He said the FAA said there were thunderstorms over Dallas. I shared that I called friends in various locations in Dallas and NO ONE saw a single could in the sky. I shared that ALL other airlines were flying from Atlanta to Dallas that afternoon and evening with no knowledge of storms in Dallas. SWA refused to offer even partial compensation. He said talking to anyone above him would be wasting my time and would not transfer me to a supervisor. I hung up. It was obvious SWA was not going to acknowledge they made a mistake cancelling our flight or even apologize for causing such unnecessary stress and expense costing us over $1,200.00 in additional ticket fees."
"""delay after delay after delay""","✅ Verified Review | I have flown Southwest Airlines through Houston and Dallas over 15 times in last year and there has been delay after delay after delay. Most recent day was due to not having enough flight attendants / staff. Southwest is an extremely unreliable airline. I fly out of New Orleans twice per month and will be taking my business elsewhere from now on."
"""had an awful experience""","✅ Verified Review | We had an awful experience traveling from Ft. Lauderdale to Albuquerque on Southwest Airlines yesterday. First let me say that SWA has always been our airline of choice, but yesterday we experienced terrible customer service, and I do not know if we will ever fly with them again. At the Ft. Lauderdale airport our flight was delayed by an hour and a half. We asked to re-rout the remainder of our flights, but we were assured that we had plenty of time to make all of our flights, so we had no need to re-rout. Our flight touched down in Nashville to allow more passengers to board the plane, the flight was then held on the ground to allow passengers that had been re-routed time to board the plane so that they could make connecting flights. We asked for help from the flight attendants, but were told it was out of their hands. When the flight landed in Denver we had fifteen minutes to catch our connecting flight, but the pilot announced that we could not get a gate, so we were held on the tarmac until after our flight left. At this point we went to the gate to ask for help and were told that we were held in Nashville so that many more people could make connecting flights, it was a business decision to hold us up so that more people could make their flights. We were told that we had been rebooked on the first flight out the next morning at 6:50 am (it was 10:00 at this time). I asked to speak to a supervisor because we now had to spend an unplanned night in Denver ""so that more people could make connecting flights, a business decision."" The same supervisor refused to give us a hotel voucher stating that he had already given away all vouchers for the day, but offered us a worthless coupon for a ""discount"" on a Best Western hotel room ($157-unsure when he could have a shuttle pick us up) or a no name hotel for $69 no shuttle. We ended up spending $234 at the Westin on the airport property since we had to be back at the airport for our flight in 6.5 hours by the time all of this transpired. The next day when we got home and claimed our luggage, it was wet, with the clothes inside soaked. In my opinion, if an airline makes ""a business decision"" to inconvenience one set of passengers to accommodate another set of passengers, they are at least obligated to pay for the hotel room of the stranded passengers."
"""no one has shown any interest""","✅ Verified Review | Northwest Florida Beaches to Nashville. I'm delayed at PCB airport with a baby and have made multiple attempts to get released from this flight and rebooked so I can get my daughter to a hotel and in the bed. We left the upstairs area where we were boarding without knowing we couldn't get back through and although I've spoken to several people here who work for SWA everyone here is telling me they can't help me and I'll have to keep waiting. I've also called the customer service number to attempt to make the changes that way and they to aren't assisting me. All I need to do is rebook a flight for tomorrow and no one has shown any interest in helping me despite the fact that I have a very exhausted and upset child who needs to be in the bed. This has been by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had with an airline and will definitely cause me to reconsider ever booking another SWA flight. This is truly a nightmare and the SWA staff here should be better equipped to serve its customers."
"""Not good for anything""","✅ Verified Review | Baltimore to Tampa. The worst airline ever. Me and my family flew on it 3 times within last week. All three flights were delayed with two of them delayed by 3 and 4 hours and this is for a 2 hr direct flight. All our plans got messed up. The lack of seat assignments is a major inconvenience. Not good if you have connections to other airlines - you will miss them. Not good for weekend getaway - you will spend it on the airport. Not good for anything."
"""got on the plane and sat and sat""","✅ Verified Review | Never want to fly Southwest Airlines again! We left 3.5 hours late, but of course were only notified of a one hour delay prior to arriving at the airport so had to sit around for hours. Then we got on the plane and sat and sat, were told we were cleared for take off, then sat some more, then moved up to number two in line when the pilot came on and said we didn't have enough fuel so needed to go back to the gate to get more. How can you not fuel an airplane sufficiently for a 1.5 hour flight? Unbelievable. Don't recommend using this airline and SFO is a nightmare also."
"""I'm impressed with the service overall""","✅ Verified Review | First time flying this airline (RDU-MCO-RDU), and I have to say I'm impressed with the service overall. It's no frills, but the customer service is excellent and two free checked bags is even better. I know some people like to badmouth EarlyBird Check In, but I bought it a few days before my flight and got A60 on both trips. Both were full flights and on time, while the return flight was eight minutes early. Considering late afternoon flights from Orlando tend to get delayed due to late afternoon storms, that was a nice change. The captain on both flights kept us informed of any developments and whenever we hit bumpy spots. Only negative things about my flight were the worn seats and the flat Coke I was given. A fairly uneventful flight, which is how I like it. Highly recommend Southwest Airlines."
"""touched at how friendly and kind they both were""","✅ Verified Review | I have severe anxiety when I fly. This flight had some turbulence that made me have a small panic attack. When the stewardess saw me she instantly invited me to come stretch in the back, gave me ginger ale and a cold compress. While I was back there the stewardesses provided me with reassurance, conversation and encouragement. I was so touched at how friendly and kind they both were, constantly checking in on me and also bringing my husband a drink."
"""time obviously means nothing""","✅ Verified Review | We flew from Atlanta to St. Louis on July 12 with Southwest. We left Atlanta an hour late because the plane was held up for late arriving passengers. Didn't know any airline would inconvenience a plane full of customers who selected a departure time only to be ignored. What could we do? Southwest had us on the plane so we were captive to their whim. Now after an exhausting week, again we are delayed an hour (could be more) leaving St. Louis to return to Atlanta. The most insulting thing about this delay is that there has been a plane at the gate since well before regularly scheduled departure time but zero activity. Zero explanation from SW. I guess they think we don't deserve that courtesy. I'm disappointed, aggravated and wondering why I keep putting myself through this with SW. Beware, time obviously means nothing. By the way, radar shows clear skies from St. Louis to Atlanta."
"""avoid the San Diego airport""","✅ Verified Review | Sacramento to San Antonio via San Diego. My flights with Southwest Airlines were fine. On the return flight - the copilot actually came down the aisle and introduced himself and wished everyone a good flight - nice touch. My issue came with the connecting gates in San Diego - Gates 1, 1A and 2. The first flight from Sacramento to San Diego - I had to change gates. Much to my surprise, I had to go through TSA security again because you walked from a secure area to a non-secure area. Even though I purchased a bottle of water in a secure area at the originating gate - I had to toss it because of the 2nd TSA security screen. On the way back - I had purchased a few items from the gift shops while waiting for my flight. Unfortunately, I had to change gates in San Diego - and had to go through the 2nd TSA security screen again. During this screen, I was told I could not keep a bottle of jelly I had purchased in the gift shop (receipt still in the bag) because it was over the limit - how incredibly ridiculous is that? I wasn't leaving the area without my purchased jelly - I didn't break any rules and I was going to be penalized due to SWA sending passengers on connecting flights through those gates. At one point I was told to just go back and get my luggage and place the jelly in my luggage - seriously? I just got off a plane and am in the process of going to a gate for my connecting flight - how on earth am I supposed to go get my bag? After speaking to the TSA supervisor and making it very clear I was not leaving without my jelly - the TSA agent decided they would test the jelly for whatever they test liquids for and then wrapped it up and handed it back to me after it passed the test. I can't be the first passenger this has happened to and the TSA agents explained they had made SWA aware of this issue but nothing had been done. For goodness sake SWA, use a little common sense and fix this issue. Have passengers who have to use those gates for connecting flights enter a separate area divided by security glass or stop routing passengers to those gates if they are changing gates for connecting flights. The current situation is beyond frustrating and really is inexcusable - there has to be a simple fix and if it isn't a simple fix - you should still fix it because it is a huge issue for your customers. For now - traveler beware - if you are changing gates during travel - avoid the San Diego airport because if your connecting flight is through gates 1, 1A or 2 - you can kiss that water or any gifts you just purchased in the secure area of your last flight that are liquid good-bye."
"""wanted some type of compensation""","✅ Verified Review | Hartford to Orlando. I will never fly Southwest again, they do not care at all about customers. My flight was cancelled only 4 hours before it was scheduled leave. When I called to see why it was cancelled they said they had no idea. I was flying down to visit family for only 3 days, and I took off work. They changed my flight to a 5am trip so now I had to wake up at 2am to get to the airport. When I called Southwest they said that they couldn't do anything for me that it was not their fault or their responsibility. I wasn't asking for my money back I just wanted some type of compensation for my inconvenience."
"""unbeatable value""","✅ Verified Review | Great flight at unbeatable value from Pittsburgh to Denver. Easy check-in, bags drop-off (2 pieces included in the basic fare!), convenient boarding process and seating, outstanding onboard service. It was my first flight ever with Southwest and I will surely fly again with them wherever I can!"
"""not be using them again""","✅ Verified Review | Baltimore to Orlando. Not impressed. You must check in within 24 hours. I checked in what I thought was quickly and ended up in group c. Why don't they have assigned seating? Got another awful seat like I always do. I only had 1 bag but it was overweight so I was charged $75. So if I had 2 bags I would not have been? What is that about. Third bad experience with this airline. Will not be using them again!"
"""worst experience yet""","✅ Verified Review | This was the worst experience with Southwest Airlines yet. My plan was due to leave at 1:15pm from Atlanta to Orlando but was delayed until 6pm due to maintenance. The 6pm flight was then delayed until 7:45 making miss an important conference that I was booked for. I will never fly with Southwest again!!"
"""Best customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Oakland to Phoenix. Southwest Airlines has always been great to me. Today they showed me why I will always choose them as my preferred airline. My meeting got canceled and I was supposed to fly out at 5pm today. I am now on 6.30am flight to Phoenix. Best customer service."
"""staff friendly and helpful""","✅ Verified Review | Since 1999, I have flown Southwest and never had problems with it. They have decent seats, and the staff has been friendly and helpful. In addition, Southwest prices are generally fair that customer can purchase tickets in advance for cheaper than most other carriers. They have added some decent flights which were beneficial to our whereabouts. Their boarding process, although different, works well. Fort Lauderdale Airport's Concourse B requires more expansion of rooms and gates because I see the heavy crowd, which makes me uncomfortable to walk. Sometimes chairs are full; you have to stand up, waiting to board. There are few plugs to charge devices. Tampa Airport's Concourse C looks very neat and comfortable. There are many plugs to charge devices. Thus, I have heard Southwest has 101 destinations in the United States and 8 additional countries that its airline connections are expanding. I have been flying often B737, which is great planes with good seats, and I hope Southwest buy more new next generation Boeing planes with more room for legs. Lastly, Southwest Airlines offers internet service using a satellite-based Wi-Fi provider. Cost per device for Wi-Fi access is $8. I know Wi-Fi is not free, and I wish Southwest offer us for 100% free Wi-Fi in order to contact with families and/or friends and watch streaming movies or shows. Therefore, I'm glad that I have decided to fly this airline without a doubt."
"""we were given no updates or information""","✅ Verified Review | It was the worst flight I've ever taken. Flew from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Islip, NY. They delayed us an hour due to weather, 2 hours due to air traffic control, and then 5 hours because the pilot's hours to fly had expired and they needed to find another crew. Found a crew and then the crew cancelled at 2am. They then made me wait in a line for 3 hours to change my flight. I was in the airport for 12 hours straight and all they provided me was a mini bag of mini pretzels and 6oz water. They refused a hotel, transportation and food after keeping us in an airport for 12 hours just to cancel the flight. They expected me to travel for 24 hours straight starting at 6am. Meaning they wanted me to stay up for 48 hours straight. I get on the flight for 24 hours later, a direct flight and they delayed my 6.20pm flight until 10.45pm. I had to reschedule my flight for the following day yet again and they weren't willing to provide hotel, transportation or food once again. So my flight was initially 6.30pm from Fort Lauderdale and we were supposed to land at 9.20pm in Islip. We were given an hour delay due to weather (7.30pm-10.30pm). After the delay, we boarded the plane (7.00pm). They then proceeded to keep us on the plane for over an hour as directed by federal air traffic control (8.00pm). Then they made us sit another hour on the plane demanding that we all stay in our seats and stay buckled because they expected to depart soon (9pm). After this hour, the pilot comes on the PA system and told us that he's reached the maximum number of consecutive hours that the pilot policies allow (9.30). They took us back to the gate where we were given no updates or information for at least 2 hours (11.30). After this, they told us that they were trying to find a pilot and crew to fly the plane. They then told us that our flight would board at 12.50am. They delayed us twice more until they cancelled my flight at approximately 2am. They automatically rebooked me for a flight that would board at 8.30am in Fort Lauderdale and would bring me to Tampa. They would then give me a 10 hour layover in Tampa. I would board the 10.30pm flight to Islip and get back at approximately 1.30am. I waited in a line 3 hours to get this changed and also demanded a hotel, transportation, and food (5am). They hadn't fed us anything but a mini sized bag of mini pretzels and 6oz of water in 13 hours. They refused a hotel. They refused transportation. They refused food. They also told me that they could not change this horrible flight. I went back to them twice and harassed them before they finally put me on a flight that boarded exactly 24 hours from the one I originally had. The woman was extremely snotty and rude to me the entire time. I had to call my friend at 5 in the morning after she, her parents and my parents stayed up the entire night. My friend picked me up at 5.45am because Southwest wouldn't even provide me with a taxi."
"""last trip was very upsetting""","✅ Verified Review | I have flown Southwest in the past and never had problems with it. However, this last trip was very upsetting due to the very rude customer service. We had a flight from Chicago to Dallas and then to El Paso which is home for us. From Chicago to Dallas as we started approaching Dallas the weather conditions became difficult and we knew we were going to have delays. It took an hour to land and I completely understand and would never complain about the fact that there are delays due to weather and also due to keeping us safe. Once we landed our next flight was delayed for about an hour. So we hung around and waited. Then it got delayed for another half hour, 45 minutes, then delayed for 15 more minutes, etc. The delays kept coming, then finally they said we were going to board. So they told us they would be ready to board but they couldn't find a pilot. This was at around 11:30 pm. So they kept saying a pilot was on his way and any minute now we will board. Around 1 am I get a notification that the flight has been cancelled. I wish it could have gotten cancelled earlier so we could make accommodations as to where to sleep. I don't understand how you don't have a pilot. And if that's the case, then please just tell us with time so we can make accommodations. People started running to Southwest counters and we were notified that only 2 counters were open. They said you can call and rebook or wait in line at the counter. I called as I waited in line and they told me they could not assist me over the phone because I had a bag checked in. When the counters opened everybody ran to the counter and I had to pick up my 5 year old who was asleep on the floor so by the time I got to the counter I was toward the end of the line. I stood in line until about 3:45 am. When it was finally my turn, the staff was extremely rude. They treated us like we should be grateful they were even lifting a finger for us. The first lady I talked to was Chinese and had broken English. As soon as I walked up she rolled her eyes at me. Before I even spoke. I felt contempt seeing as I was the one who had been standing in line close to 4 hours. But I am a nice person so I decided to smile and be polite anyway. I asked her to please rebook my flight as early as possible and she gave me 2 options: one for 7 am departure connecting at Austin which was already delayed or one for 7 pm direct flight. I told her I was skeptical about the 7 am one since it was already delayed but 7 pm is such a long time to wait when you don't have anywhere to sleep or shower and my luggage is checked in. She gave me a look of not my problem tapped her fingers on the counter and told me to pick one. I asked her if they could help accommodate us so we could sleep somewhere and at this she became very angry and told me ""we aren't going to give you anything!"" She treated me like I was trying to get some ""advantage"" of the situation. I just wanted a place to sleep, and if there's nothing to be done there is a way to state things politely. I told her I needed to think it over and I would come back but really I wanted to not be taken care of by her. I went back in line and got another representative. He was a little bit nicer but he also kept chatting to the guy next to him for long periods of time as if I wasn't there. Maybe the system was reloading or maybe he was just ignoring me. I saw a lot of people crying and I don't blame them. We slept at the airport until boarding time."
"""expected better customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Baltimore to Providence. Dissatisfied with Southwest's customer service policy. Flying today from Baltimore to Providence. Circumstances changed and trying to fly standby on an earlier flight home we were told it would be an additional $125 on a $60 flight. Watched the plane take off only half full. Would have cost them nothing to put us on that plane instead of spending 3 hours in the airport. I am a SW Rapid Rewards credit card holder and would have expected better customer service from a company that prides itself on no additional fees being their difference. Will definitely choose to use my travel cards that allow flexible flying on different airlines in the future."
"""delay on return flight was 3 hours""","✅ Verified Review | Washington to Providence. This was the first time I had flown Southwest in several years, never having had a problem in the past. This time was different! The departure flight was delayed 1.5 hours because of a ""plane switch"" related to a mechanical problem. While this was mildly annoying, I did not complain to any staff personnel. The delay on my return flight 2 days later was twice as long--3 hours--and for the same reason. By then, my patience was exhausted, so I asked for more information from the gate attendant. She informed me that our particular scheduled aircraft had not experienced any problem but instead had been rerouted to the west coast from Chicago to replace a plane that had been delayed for several hours while undergoing repairs, in other words, another ""plane switch."" That plane was instead used to ferry us to Wash., DC. Had repairs taken longer, we would have been stuck even longer in Providence, unless Southwest had decided to spread the misery even more. Southwest offered no alternative flights on other airlines nor did they offer a voucher as compensation for the delay. If their planes are so unreliable, perhaps they need to establish sharing arrangements with other airlines or keep planes in reserve for such occasions. Ground personnel were courteous but were apparently unable to offer any practical assistance or compensation for the inconvenience."
"""absolute new favorite airline""","✅ Verified Review | Buffalo to Denver via Phoenix. This was my first time flying with Southwest. I had heard that they were excellent and after my horrendous experience with AA at the beginning of my trip, I decided to switch my return flight to Southwest Airlines. Everyone from the lady at the check in counter to the flight attendants were amazing. The seats were comfortable, good IFE. The flight attendant from Phoenix to Denver was the best I have ever had on a flight and I fly several times a year. My only complaint was that my baggage was put on the wrong flight out of Phoenix into Denver but the lady at baggage claim was so kind and helpful in making sure that my baggage got back to me quickly. My absolute new favorite airline. I'm so glad I decided to fly this airline."
"""I'm not impressed at all""","✅ Verified Review | I flew from Raleigh to Tampa with a carry on. When heading home (full flight) I'm in A group and conveniently I'm unable to carry on the same bag which put me at the back of the line and forced to sit in the middle of two full sized men and not even able to sit with my husband. I always fly Allegiant and decided to pay more, triple more so I could get to my destination a little sooner and I'm not impressed at all. Now, we've been sitting on a hot plane for 15 minutes and they just let us know we have to headbback to the gate for maintance. I'd rather be flying Allegiant."
"""amazing customer service experience""","❎ Unverified | Minneapolis to Washington via Chicago. I had an amazing customer service experience yesterday. My flight was delayed 40 minutes, so I landed in Chicago at 9pm. My connection boarded at 8:40, leaving at 9pm. I was sprinting from gate B3 to B7 at 9:02pm (sorry to the person who's bag I rolled over) and it was empty. Suddenly a lady comes running over ""are you Rebecca?!"" I can only nod yes before I bend over to catch my breath, as she barely slows to pull open the door and continues at full speed down the bridge. A flight attendant comes back with her to scan my ticket, and I thankfully board the plane and arrive home at midnight. Words cannot express how much I needed to catch that flight and not extend this trip. Thank you Southwest!"
"""No apologies, nothing""","✅ Verified Review | Burbank to Tucson via Las Vegas. I am writing this before I fly with them once again tomorrow because I am so disgusted. I got a notice that my flight( tonight) was delayed two hours. I couldn't get in touch with anyone for over 30 minutes. Their site said ""no info."" So I finally talked to a REAL person (after being tortured with stupid offers a cruise, Medic Alert and all kinds of other rubbish.) I asked if my connecting flight to Tucson was delayed. Yes, one hour, but will leave before I arrive in Vegas. ""There are no flights to Tucson tonight."" So I would have just sat in the airport all night? No apologies, nothing."
"""flight attendants knowledgeable and funny""","✅ Verified Review | Southwest Airlines continues to do what their advertising says: the best service with the customer in mind. Flew from Phoenix, AZ to Hartford, CT. Found the prices, free luggage and no change fees terrific. Made a change over the phone with a helpful agent in a matter of minutes. With other airlines, it would have taken a lot longer and cost $100+. Also, the flight attendants were knowledgeable and funny. Now, whenever possible, I fly Southwest."
"""will not use Southwest again""","❎ Unverified | On my return flight from Atlanta we were shuttled to Chicago instead of going to straight to Detroit. They told us they would give us a voucher for the inconvenience. I did not receive my voucher and contacted them several times. They said they would email it and then I couldn't open the email. They said they would put it in the mail then I didn't receive it. Finally after booking another flight to Atlanta and paying for it, I got 2 vouchers in the mail. I tried to book another flight using the vouchers, but was told that one of them was not valid. I spent 1 hour on the phone holding for customer service and was told that the one voucher which came at the same time as the other one was the older one which they had cancelled and reissued. I felt at this point that Southwest owed me at the very least another voucher. But they were not willing to help me out for my troubles. I will not use Southwest again due to the poor customer service."
"""reconsider flying them again""","✅ Verified Review | Orlando to Boston via Nashville. I am very upset with the service of this airline. I have never had a problem with Southwest Airlines prior to this trip. On the way down from Boston, the plan was switched twice due to mechanical issues. Needless to say we were stuck in Logan for an additional four hours. They thought that a $100 per voucher per ticket would be okay. Absolutely wrong. We missed our connecting flight and had issues with our car rental because we were late. On our return flight, we had felt with a rude desk staff at gate 121/122. I had asked if we could use the family boarding due to the fact that one of my brothers had a fear of flying and the other, it was his second time flying. They are 17 and 13. She said nope, he's not 6 and I am not allowing it, the standards are enforced here. I told her the southwest personnel in Boston and in Baltimore understood our situation and allowed us to board with families. She said she was not allowing it what so ever. I asked for a manager she said no one was around. I then proceeded to ask for the customer care line to where she gave me a card with minimal information on it. I had to ask a second time for the number. I am very displeased with the entire trip with flying with Southwest Airlines and I will reconsider flying with them again."
"""we would not fly Southwest again""","✅ Verified Review | Midway-Chicago to Tampa, with Southwest Airlines. My husband and I haven't flown in years. Staff were friendly, but not so helpful. The boarding process was fine, until we actually got to the plane. We were unaware that there is not assigned seating. We had to separate, him in front me in back. I was very upset about this as I was already nervous about the flight to begin with. Now I had to sit with strangers. We were one of the last to board and it was obvious we were together (tickets purchased together). Not one staff member tried to help and see if they could get us seats together. The icing on the cake was the horrible uncomfortable flight between two larger men. At this point I had fully decided, we would not fly Southwest again. Fortunately this flight was only 2.5hrs. Their flights are cheap, but I will pay the extra to a different airline to be comfortable, and to sit with the people I am flying with. I did notice that they let families flying with children board first which is great! I have two children that I would want with me too, had they been traveling with us. One suggestion though, maybe couples be allowed to board after that then singles could fill in the empty seats. Or just have assigned seating."
"""can't say I will fly them again""","✅ Verified Review | Orange County to Louisville. When boarding my plane, Southwest Airlines requested volunteers for being bumped onto another flight, I was second in line to offer up my seat for $300. Halfway getting onto the plane (I was in the B boarding group), they called me off of the plane. Ten people had to climb over my suitcase while I got off the airplane, and I was told after getting off that they didn't need me to volunteer anymore. Angrily, I re-boarded the plane and was the last person to get on, and had to sit in the only seat available in the very back of the plane. When I got to my connecting flight, I was supposed to stay on the airplane and go to the next city. Upon landing, I was told to get off the airplane and would be moved to another plane at a different gate. This gate and plane change was not the only inconvenience, the plane would now be delayed by 2.5 hours! This would put me in at 01:40am! My husband has to work in the morning and we live nearly an hour away from the airport, so he has to come get me in the middle of the night. My original arrival time would have been at 22.50 or (10.50 pm). The ticket lady told me that the pilot forgot his passport in Cancun? I'm not sure what that has to do with why the plane was over two hours late. This infuriated me. I am a frequent customer with this airline because of their cheap fares. I get you get what you pay for. I can't say I will be flying with them again, unless I'm desperate for a cheap flight."
"""very disappointed with Southwest""","✅ Verified Review | Indianapolis to Las Vegas with Southwest Airlines. Worst flying experience I've had. Got a later flight non-stop, booked to take off at 8:45 but my flight was delayed 3 times and by the 3rd time it was because the pilot had too many flying hours. They didn't have a back up pilot until roughly 20min after the plane has landed, that backup pilot was in St. Louis. So on my non-stop flight we had to make a stop. I bought the internet and it kept going on and off, on and off. Why offer internet if you can't have a stable connection? Better yet why do you charge for it if the Internet Is poor? Ridiculous honestly, I'm very disappointed with Southwest."
"""free refills and extra snacks""","✅ Verified Review | Fort Lauderdale to Chicago Thursday night April 6. Flight was supposed to be delayed 35 minutes but actual delay time was only 20 minutes. Flight attendants and pilot were awesome. We were offered free refills and extra snacks, very pleased. Only cost $212 to fly a family of 5 (infant on lap). Checked in 3 bags free of charge!"
"""going to be losing customers""","✅ Verified Review | Chicago to Ft Lauderdale. What the heck happened to Southwest? Customer service is awful. No customer support anymore. Been having issues with them lately. Today was the last straw. Overbooked my flight- wouldn't let me or my husband on. No seats available, although the desk agent said we made the cut and would get on the plane. (This was after a 2 hour delay). Couldn't get us to our destination until a day and a half. For a 3 day getaway, nope. Vacation was cancelled. And when dealing with them after- they don't care one bit. Just want your money. What a shame of a company Southwest has turned into. Take note Southwest, or you are going to be losing customers. (You've lost us). I'm not the only one noticing this decline as of late."
"""customer service 1/10""","✅ Verified Review | Phoenix to San Francisco with Southwest. April 2, 2017 Flight 5717 scheduled to leave 6:40 pm. Alerted that flight will depart 10:10 pm. Flight tracker published inbound flight due in at 6:20 pm. Why the 3 hr delay? Called to determine status. 23 minutes later on the phone listening to ""happy"" music gave up. Southwest customer service 1/10!"
"""decline in customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Portland to Austin. My complaint is the decline in Southwest Airlines customer service. I'd been a raving fan for decades about SW, now I'm done. The straw that broke the camel's back was me booking travel for my wife to meet me in DC for Spring break. I booked the ticket in January for travel March 28th. When I left four days earlier for DC neither my wife or I received her confirmation, so Saturday I call Southwest. The ticketing agent was great about helping us find my wife's confirmation, she informed me I accidently made it for the 21st not the 28th, and that they recorded it as a no-show. She said usually you forfeit the funds, but in this case purchase a replacement short notice replacement for the date you wanted, the 28th, then M-F call our customer relations team and they will allow you to use the prior dollars spent as a credit for 12 months against future travel. Well today the 28th from my tradeshow I waited over 20 minutes until the agent answered the phone, at 9:15am. She was very terse with me and said it didn't matter what the ticketing agent told me Saturday, that I did have to forfeit the few hundred dollars I spent on the prior ticket I did not use. I said even though I was instructed differently by a colleague of hers? She said yes, and that I cannot be connected to a supervisor as she is the only supervisor."
"""made me hate this airline""","✅ Verified Review | Detroit to Atlanta. The entire trip was terrible. The check in people were mean and not understanding in anyway. The airplane system was terribly unorganized and everyone we had to talk to was horrible, besides one lady. We missed our first flight because the check in kiosk wasted our time. We eventually made it to Atlanta. The flight back was mainly the same story, except I ran ahead of my mother and made it to the gate. I told them we were here and that my mother was on her way. The man hadn't closed the door and started telling me he didn't want to and he had paperwork to finish before they could fly. My mother came not a minute later and the door was shut after she arrived. The entire experience has made me hate this airline and air travel in general. I would never recomend it to anyone else looking to fly."
"""proceeded to do everything possible""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Southwest Airlines from Houston, Texas to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. This review is for the employees at the customer service desk in the boarding area. I had lost my passport and was about to board, and 4 people immediately jumped to help solve my problem. They pulled my bags off my boarding flight to Mexico immediately and made sure I was able to get my bags. They than proceeded to do everything possible to contact the airports I was previously at and talk with their lost and found to see if my passport had been found. They gave me all the information for me to obtain a new passport in Downton Houston to fly out to Mexico the next morning! Couldn't of asked for a better turn of events."
"""pilot and amazing crew""","✅ Verified Review | This review is written for the staff, pilot and amazing crew whom flew flight 5941 from Newark to Phoenix last night. The seats were comfortable for such a long flight and the drinks, snacks, TV provided were well above all expectations. Also, they went to the most ultimate extreme by presenting my fiancee and I an entire bottle of our favorite champagne once you heard we had just gotten engaged! Thank you with all our hearts. You made the last leg of our trip the absolute best."
"""accustomed to priority boarding""","✅ Verified Review | I got to my gate, my flight departure was at 845 and we didn't board until 10 min prior. The whole thing was disorganized and you couldn't hear a thing over the speakers. I'm in the military so I'm accustomed to getting called for priority boarding. I went up to the lady when we started boarding and asked her if they called military personnel up yet and she said only if I was in uniform. I've always just shown my ID and then she said ok I'll get to you in a second. She proceeded to let everyone in the first line pass by me while I stood there with my ticket while she just kept looking up at me seeing how embarrassed I was until the last person in the first line went by and then just took my ticket without a single word. I won't be flying with southwest again."
"""will be a customer from now on""","✅ Verified Review | Flew from Minneapolis to Atlanta. Just wanted to thank the staff at Southwest Airlines. I lost my phone on a flight and it was found on Washington DC. I was in Atlanta for work and they sent it to me. Staff were very nice in tracking me down and shipping it to my hotel. This was the first time I had flown Southwest but will be a customer from now on."
"""the usual Southwest experience""","❎ Unverified | Austin to New Orleans. I usually stick with full service carriers, but occasionally fly Southwest on routes where they provide a nonstop routing, such as this. Traveling one way to New Orleans for a sports competition my wife was participating in. Needed to check a couple of bags, using a Kiosk. All in all check in took no more than 5 minutes, despite a busy morning at AUS. Spent time in the United Club, then went to the gate about 45 minutes prior to boarding. We fly often enough with Southwest, so we are familiar with the boarding process, which to tell the truth, if I have to fly coach, I prefer. We always pay the earlybird check in fee, we are always in group A, even though it's not guaranteed, so we always get a good choice of seats. Sitting together, had a window and aisle, row 2, as the flight was not full this morning. Fast boarding, on time departure, quick taxi and we were off. Rainy morning this morning, so take off was bumpy and drink service delayed, but once above the clouds, we were served the usual complimentary drinks and light snacks. 58 minutes later on the ground in MSY, a quick taxi and an on time arrival. Bags were off quicker than American Airlines ever does, even when priority bags are attached. Over all a good value, quick trip, on time, nice crew, comfortable, clean plane. In short the usual Southwest experience."
"""FAs provided excellent service""","✅ Verified Review | Flight 5401, San Jose - Phoenix on Mar 4 2017 was uneventful, with on-time departure and arrival, along with the usual friendly in-flight service (one round of drinks and peanuts) by the Flight Attendants (FAs). The return flight 611, PHX – SJC on Mar 5 2017, scheduled to depart at 10.05 pm, was progressively delayed. At 5.59 pm, they moved the departure time to 10.45. At 6.31, they moved departure to 11.15. At 9.03 they changed departure to 11.45. We finally boarded, took our seats, and at 11.50 pm, right before push-back from the gate, an instrument (artificial horizon) broke. The pilot had to wait for another plane to land at PHX so mechanics could take that instrument from that plane and install it in ours. We finally departed at 12.15 am. Experiencing the delay get progressively extended, was a bit stressful, but eventually we made it to our destination, and on this flight the FAs again provided excellent service (even though I’m sure they had been as frustrated by the delay as the passengers were."
"""delivering a good product""","❎ Unverified | Reno to Las Vegas return. I fly this route 4-5 times a year. Southwest has their act together on this easy 1 hour flight. On time departure with normal Southwest courtesy on this route. Quick boarding, quick push-back and off we went. Luggage arrived in a timely manner in Vegas. Return flight was delayed by 15 minutes, then 30 minutes due to very high winds. Understandable. The captain let us know we would have a bumpy take off and some bumpy conditions on and off during the flight. No drink service during the flight due to the weather and the flight crew did apologize for that but when the captain wants everyone seated then that is it. Anyway the flight was not as bad as we were led to think. Was windy and snowing upon landing in Reno. All in all Southwest keeps delivering a good product on this flight and the ground staff and cabin crew do a good job."
"""unbelievable support I received""","✅ Verified Review | Ft Myers to Baltimore Washington via Providence. I just wanted to say how incredibly thankful I am for the unbelievable support I received from Southwest Airlines. I had an accident a few weeks ago and am still recovering and had to travel with my small dog. Their team was attentive and very helpful during my entire journey. As tired as I was after the entire trip, I have nothing but great things to say for Southwest Airlines staff. They helped with with wheelchair travel and even helped pick up my pup when I was unable to lift her. The staff is A+ in my book and I just needed to let who ever may read this know how great they all were."
"""will never fly them again""","✅ Verified Review | Terrible customer service. I am even a rapids reward account holder and I will never fly them again. I cancelled a reservation for $689 and when I tried to use the credit for a family vacation they would only apply part of my credit because my daughter wasn't on the cancelled reservation? So now you want me to have a useless $177.50 credit that will expire and have to pay full price again for a ticket for my 3 year old daughter, and give you $300 more dollars? Way to screw up our family vacation Southwest."
"""the first and last time I fly Southwest""","✅ Verified Review | This is the first and last time I fly Southwest. I'm very dissapointed after hearing nothing but great things about the airline. I flew in from Dallas Lovefield to Phoenix Arizona for a business meeting. On my way out of Dallas I found no line. But I did find two female Southwest employees at the check in counter chatting about the night before. They were very disinterested in being engaged with me during the chek in process but they got the job done and checked my bag in, as well as print my boarding pass for me. When it came time to board I was in the B group. That was far enough back to land me in the last row by the bathroom but at least it was an aisle seat. Great since I'm 28-going on 29 weeks pregnant and I may need to get up to use the rest room. I've only flown American and Delta with assigned seats. I hate this open seating policy because the person who came to sit next to me was a large man who barely fit into the middle seat and caused for an uncomfortable ride. I had to lean out toward the aisle the entire flight. Once we landed they open the back door to reload snacks and drinks for the plane that is going on to San Diego I believe. No big deal until the plan begins to get refueled! The fumes were so strong and awful. Fast forward a day, I'm pleased to go home to Dallas, hoping for better luck with my seat this time. Unfortunately my pass says I'm in group C. Even further out from boarding than on my flight in. At our boarding time of 5.15pm we were told that the flight crew for our flight will not even land until 5.45pm, that we may begin boarding at 6.10pm to leave at 6.30pm. This is all a maybe. You would think a company would have better logistics to get their staff here earlier or on time."
"""disrespect we received""","✅ Verified Review | Austin to Denver. There was a checkin problem and they were no help. My wife and I could not even sit together. Their pre boarding check in failed and screwed us. This is the last time I will ever use Southwest Airlines. The level of disrespect we received from their support people was beyond stupid. We paid extra for this too?"
"""one of the poorest experiences""","✅ Verified Review | Oakland to Burbank. I had one of the poorest experiences in recent travel with Southwest Airlines. I found the ground crew and attendents at the gates somewhat rude and very unhelpful. I missed my flight because of a last minute gate change and when I complained about lack of proper communication the gate crew rolled her eyes and looked away. So unprofessional! Perhaps Southwest should treat its employees better so they don't act out like this in public and treat the passengers better."
"""don't like the group seating arrangement""","✅ Verified Review | Nashville to Minneapolis. I will never fly Southwest Airlines again. Direct flight and we had a stop in Chicago? That doesn't sound like a direct flight. Got chuckled at when we questioned why. Checked in at the same time as my husband and our boarding ""groups"" are A and B. Therefore with the ""group"" seating we don't get to sit together. We could pay $80 to upgrade to preferred seating so we get first dibs on seats. If we checked in at the exact same time, tickets are linked one confirmation number why would our boarding ""group"" not be the same. Do not like the group seating arrangement. Will not fly this airline again."
"""stupidest airline in the sky""","❎ Unverified | Newark to Orlando. Open seating policy. I've never flown Southwest Airlines before today. In fact we're still taxiing as I write this. I was told the night before that there is an open seating policy with Southwest but until boarding I didn't quite understand what that meant. For those of you who do not know, when you check-in you are assigned a zone and a number. This is the order by which you board and from there it's general admission. Maybe that sounds fine until you travel with your wife and kid and realize that you will be forced to rely on the general good will of the 160 people who have boarded the plane ahead of you in order to sit with your family. We were not so fortunate. Even when the entire plane of passengers was bribed with free drinks for the flight, there were still no takers. I boarded the plane only to find 14 or so empty middle seats. This is my first and last flight on Southwest Airlines. The stupidest airline in the sky."
"""have had 99% good experiences""","✅ Verified Review | Reno to South Padre Island via Dallas. Great seats, excellent service, on time departure and arrival, good value. I have been flying Southwest since I was 18 (and before that, but not on my own dollar). I have the SWA Chase points card RapidRewards. I love that too. The only thing SWA does not offer is premium econ, between first class and coach, which I wish they did. Often on flights I give them my drink coupons or offer to pay and they don't let me, they will comp the drink, or a nearby passenger will share coupons. Not sure why but the people who choose to fly SWA are pretty awesome. Great baggage handling and free bags. Excellent flight change policy: it is free, and if you need to catch a flight from another airline, they will try to help, which has saved me a huge amount of stress and dollars. I have had 99% good experiences with Southwest Air. I wish they flew to Hawaii and Europe!"
"""Horrible customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Orlando to Minneapolis via Atlanta. Worst experience flying to date. Horrible customer service, no compassion. After being taxied to the run way we were taxied back to the gate, they bumped us to another flight without giving any other options, because with the time sitting at the gate we would not make our connecting flight. We now have over 8hrs of extra time in the airport. We were not offered anything for the inconvenience and we're handed a card with a customer service phone number. When calling the number they are open Monday through Friday and we are flying on a Saturday, not helpful at all. Not once did anyone apologize for the inconvenience but instead made us feel like an inconvenience to them. I would not recommend Southwest Airlines to anyone, especially when traveling with kids."
"""issue is the false advertisement""","✅ Verified Review | Houston to Midland via Dallas. I'm disappointed because the Southwest Airlines commercials and adds state that if an emergency arises that they are always willing to work with a customer. I called Southwest, stated that we had a family emergency arise, that I had to transport my mom to the hospital. The customer agent stated she was sorry and that I needed to pay $216.00 extra for another flight. If you're going to charge people then don't tell us you would love to work with us. However inflight services by pilots and cabin crew are and have always been fantastic for me, the airline has been on time and in most cases saved 20 mins from jetway to jetway. I had one flight that was 20 mins late only because the pilots had a false engine reverse thruster alarm sound when landing from the previous flight which the mechanics corrected promptly and without incident. My only issue is the false advertisement."
"""Poor customer service""","Oakland to Las Vegas. I have not yet taken this flight yet, but I was rescheduled to take this March 8 flight after my March 7 flight was canceled 2 months in advance with out any reason. We cannot take a later flight as I purchased these tickets to match up with a wedding trip in Hawaii. When a customer is put at a disadvantage the company usually does something to accommodate the disadvantage they put the customer in. Southwest only offered to refund my flight. But there is no other airline that is flying to our home that late. The only offer that would be accommodating is to refund atleast partial points, or the money I had to spend to buy the points. Now my husband and I have to spend $100 on a hotel room to stay the night in oakland. I am a Southwest card-holder. Two other family members are, they only use Southwest, and that will change now. Poor customer service and an unwillingness to refund me in points even!"
"""Disappointed in the service""","✅ Verified Review | Louisville to Dallas via Tampa. There wasn't enough room for all carry-on bags. People forced to check personal bags including purses. Seating was first come first serve but we weren't told about that. I wasn't able to sit with my husband even after spending a good chunk of money for the tickets. Squished between two strangers for a three hour flight. Disappointed in the service."
"""business Select is a rip-off""","✅ Verified Review | Boston to Baltimore with Southwest Airlines. Business Select is a rip-off. I was allowed to board early. However, even with over 30 seats empty, I still had someone sit in the middle seat next to me, because I obviously can't choose where others sit. I didn't receive my free drink because of weather. So I paid $400 extra to board early, which gave me no advantage. I can't even believe they have a business option with just these insignificant advantages. My flight home again had many open seats but alas I had a middle seat occupant yet again. This was my first time flying Southwest and I will never ever fly with them again. I called to let them know I was dissatisfied with my first experience and their response was that unfortunately I would still be dissatisfied by the end of the call because they couldn't do anything about. Business Select is a joke. Please don't waste your money."
"""absolutely unbeatable service""","✅ Verified Review | Phoenix to Houston. We made an honest mistake and booked our flight for January 24th instead of December 24th. Southwest Airlines was amazing and transferred our tickets and found a flight for us on December 24th for no extra charge! Absolutely unbeatable service. They make the flight entertaining."
"""you want to lose a customer""","✅ Verified Review | I fly Southwest Airlines for business regularly, and have for the last 8 years. I have been an A-list preferred member for the entire time, typically exceeding the minimum number of points required by 10,000 or more points per year. I love Southwest's flyer-friendly policies (no change fees, etc.) and great customer service. However, they lost their way. This year, I have 69,977 points, which is 23 points short of qualifying for A-List Preferred status. I asked if, based on the fact I've exceeded the points level for the past 4 years, they could allow me to keep A-List Preferred status for 2017 because I was only 23 points short. They said no. Sad to see that Southwest is now no different than the old-fashioned airlines. I traveled Southwest because of the great customer service, but will reconsider. Honestly Southwest, you want to lose a customers who spends $12k-$15k a year with you over 23 rewards points?"
"""crew failed to tell passengers""","On a completely full flight from Baltimore to Chicago, crew failed to tell passengers not to put coats and jackets in overhead so that our luggage could fit, as is the custom. People do not want to check luggage when free carry on is the reason folks deal with the cut rate service of Southwest. Will be planning ahead next year to avoid the cattle call. This airline is like the now defunct People's Express, a cattle call for real."
"""worst for being on the time""","San Diego to Tucson with Southwest Airlines. I am sitting in the Tucson airport waiting for a flight that is delayed. Unfortunately, my flight into Tucson was also delayed. So I was delayed coming and going. Southwest employees act as if this is not of any great importance. To their customers it is a very big deal. I have flown on a variety of airlines and Southwest is the worst for being on the time. Flight times don't allow for any ""unforeseen"" events. I am disappointed and frustrated with Southwest. I would not recommend using this airline to anyone."
"""after my last few flights I'm left disappointed""","✅ Verified Review | I'm normally a big fan of Southwest, but after my last few flights I'm left disappointed. Flew from San Jose to Los Angeles. The flight attendants have been passive aggressive and the Captain virtually not understandable when he/she decides to speak. This particular flight was the worst. We were already delayed and then sat on the tarmac for almost 30 mins. I don't know what happened to Southwest, but please go back to the way it was."
"""never fly Southwest again""","✅ Verified Review | On December 16, 2016 I had a flight scheduled from Denver to Las Vegas at 9:05 pm. Southwest airlines knew of the impending snow storm yet they boarded the plane at 9:45 pm and made all the passengers sit on the tarmac for over 3.5 hours before diverting the plane back to the gate. Southwest offered no direction except to stand in that line and rebook. The line wrapped around the terminal. I went home and never got to my destination. I will never fly Southwest again."
"""my favourite company to fly with""","Kansas City to New Orleans. Southwest Airlines has always been my favourite company to fly with - I have not found an airline yet that can compare. I have had to travel more lately due to work and I will search up and down for SW flights before ever going to another airline. Recently, my name changed, and today at 11am I sent in my name change information, and just now, at about 4:15pm, I have received my confirmation emails with all of my information completely updated. I cannot rave enough about this company and I cannot ever recall having a bad experience. I have seen them deal with difficult customers and they do handle these situations in the most professional and understanding way."
"""disappointed in Southwest""","Columbus to Las Vegas. Very disappointed in Southwest. I was told by a Southwest employee that if I transferred my chase sapphire points to Southwest rewards, that those points would count towards my companion pass. When I went to book a flight the other night I was told they do not count. After talking to numerous Southwest employees, I was told nothing could be done and they offered me a USD50 voucher. I would have never transferred those chase points if I had known that. They are worth over USD800 in travel thru chase. I feel that I lost both ways and Southwest is not honoring what one of there employees told me. I like flying Southwest and will continue to do so."
"""very pleased with Southwest""","Very happy with Southwest Airlines. Traveled from Minneapolis to Phoenix with my wife and 5 kids (ages 1,3,5,7 and 9). It has been many years since I have flown and never for any of the kids. First got to the check in counter and baggage drop off in Minneapolis - not knowing procedure we were greeted right away with a smile and very friendly employee. We were checked in right away and given instructions on where to go and what we would need to do when we got to the gate with our stroller. Proceeded to go through security, again nervous as to how smoothly this would go with all the horrible stories I have heard. TSA agent checking our id's was very friendly and good about telling us where to go and what was expected of us to get though security. Got to the Southwest gate and before I could even get over to the agent he came over asked about the stroller and went back to the counter and came back a minute later with a claim ticket and label for our stroller. They explained we would board after the A ticket holders and wheel chairs as a family. We boarded the plane got to pick our seats 3 on the left side and 4 on the right with the 1 year old on my wifes lap. All Southwest attendants were nice and friendly during the flight. Landed in Arizona and got off the plane with no issues, got to baggage claim and our bads were already there waiting on the conveyor. On our way home it was just as good. Overall I was very pleased with Southwest and their staff. A great price compared to other options."
"""positive about this trip""","✅ Verified Review | Phoenix to Spokane WA. No problems. Even though I was the last of about 150 people boarding (having misunderstood the online preboarding process, I wound up having to get my boarding pass at the airport) and had to take a middle seat between two guys, who both seemed to be recovering from chest colds, my 2.2-hour run from Phoenix to Spokane was fine. Nice staff at both ends of the process. Seat not too tight. Neighboring passengers courteous. A fair boarding process. No delays. The price: not a terrific deal (my round-trip ticket between Spokane and Phoenix was just below $500), but not ruinously expensive, and this was, after all, Thanksgiving. I feel positive about this trip partly because of my last flight, from Honolulu to Ithaca, NY. That was via United. United treated coach-class passengers like sacks of dirt. It canceled a flight (D.C. to Syracuse) with no better excuse than that it was under-booked, offered no apologies, made people stand in line for one hour to get alternative routing, ultimately made me spend an extra night in Syracuse, at a cost of about $100. By comparison, this experience at Southwest was wonderful. Until I'm disabused of my faith in Southwest, I'll happily board it again."
"""last time with Southwest""","The first, only and last time we will be traveling with Southwest. They say ""open seating"" makes the boarding faster. It doesn't. It makes it easier on their end because they do not have to spend the labor on seat selections, etc. It is more like being treated like cattle in a chute. When you get to the plane, you are still waiting to get seated, just like every other airline out there. If you are lucky, you might get to sit with your other family members. Our family was not the only one that had to sit scattered throughout the plane. The attempts at humor by the flight staff did not help much either. The seats were cramped to point my shoulders hust from being so scrunched up and I am not that big of a person, 5'10"", 220lbs. The beverage service gets you about 4 sips of your drink unless you order coffee or adult beverage. One of our pieces of luggage was severely damaged so we got a $50 coupon to be used on Southwest airlines and only on Southwest airlines. I think we are throwing it away. They found more ways to nickel and dime more money out of passenger fares."
"""customer service is amazing""","✅ Verified Review | Baltimore to Denver. Southwest is the best airline for a number of reasons - customer service is amazing, flights are easy to change (I recently changed my entire flight from LAX to SNA on the same day of travel). They have the best prices. It is easy to get priority status."
"""I miss the old airline""","✅ Verified Review | Baltimore to Buffalo. Southwest Airlines - what happened? You used to be the fun Go-To airline that, no matter how bad the others, never lost its sense of humor. Now your staff are as frazzled, checked-out, and nasty as the others! Thanksgiving at BWI, the check-in configuration was confusing with people queuing in 3 places and one hapless employee trying to herd who's up first, while imperious check-in ladies route people here then there to re-print baggage tkts, refusing to help, selecting favorites from the line, stalking off, unhelpful, uninformative, and high-handed - bad Southwest service! I miss the old airline!"
"""a great experience""","✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Sacramento. My husband and I flew with our 6 month old for the first time so we could go visit family for Thanksgiving. We chose Southwest because it was literally half the price than other airlines during the holidays. We had never travelled with children before so we had our hands full with the stroller and car seat. While boarding, a man came up behind me and said ""Can I help with those?"" I said sure not realizing it was the pilot right away. He carried my car seat and stroller and waited in line with us. I told him not to worry and he could go ahead since he had more important things to do, but he waited and seemed happy to help. While descending, our son was screaming so loud, and the lovely flight attendant, came over right away and entertained him until he smiled and settled down. After landing and exiting the plane, I apologized to the staff and other passengers for my son making such a scene, but everyone was very friendly and understanding. We had such a great experience with Southwest!"
"""impressed with the staff""","Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore with Southwest Airlines. My luggage was damaged. When I went to the baggage desk I was immediately assisted. The staff inspected my luggage and offered me three ways to resolve the problem. I chose to be reimbursed immediately for $60 and the whole thing took less than 15 minutes. I was very impressed with the staff and how they handled the situation."
"""absolute best customer service""","Denver to Seattle. Southwest Airlines has the absolute best customer service. I have been flying with them for years and they always deliver. Comfortable economy seats, friendly staff, and flexibility. If they expanded their international travel, I would exclusively fly with them. I was planning on taking my parents to spend Christmas with my sister and nieces in another state but ended up needing to cancel my travel plans due to my mother becoming unexpectedly sick. The employees that I have spoke with thus far have been wonderful. We were able to come up with a solution that allowed me to keep my travel funds and I will be using them toward another trip with Southwest at a later time. The staff kindness and generosity has been excellent during a difficult time for my family and I. I will remain a loyal customer and recommend to everyone I know.."
"""no more Southwest for me""","I have been flying Southwest for over ten years and have the southwest credit card as well. I put several thousands of dollars on it a year but have noticed that I get a lot less flights with it now. I liked how they started giving you a boarding number when you check in 24 hours in advance so there aren't people arguing about the lines. But now what people are doing is saving seats all the time and it has gotten carried away. I have talked to the flight attendants about it but they say they will not get involved with it. I check in 24 hours in advance on the dot to get the best seats possible but am going farther and farther back from people saving seats now. What the customers are doing is one will get the early bird pass to get an advanced seating number and then save the remaining seats for the passengers that are flying with them. I actually was going to sit down on one flight and a woman said she was saving seven seats which was three rows and I finally said no, you cannot do that since my boarding pass was before them. She started getting loud and the flight attendant was no help whatsoever. I am not going back any further on the plane simply because others are not working with the rules Southwest has determined and does nothing for the people who play by the rules. I know this sounds petty, but I can have A tickets and cannot get seats for me and my wife until near the back of the plane. I tell the flight attendant about it and they do not respond so no more Southwest for me."
"""not happy with seating policy""","✅ Verified Review | Denver to Ontario. I was satisfied with the service for my Southwest Airlines flight but was not happy with the open seating policy. This is my third time flying Southwest and had never experienced this before. I was traveling with my husband and not only were we assigned separate boarding positions but then by the time he boarded there were no available seats for us to sit together. I do not appreciate this type of boarding and was extremely dissatisfied. If tickets are bought together the airline should allow the family to sit together like every other flight I have ever been on has done."
"""no complaints about my experience""","✅ Verified Review | Ft Lauderdale to Las Vegas. I like Southwest Airlines. The rates are reasonable. There are no hidden fees, or change fees, or bag fees. They serve snacks and drinks and for free. In all my flights, the flight crew has been friendly, and this last round trip flight was no exception. People who work for Southwest in my experience seem happy to do so. The planes are all Boeing 737's and for economy class seating, there is better space than many other airlines. The inflight entertainment is via wifi on your own device, which means no footwell intrusions from IFE boxes or bulky seatbacks. Some people are taken aback by Southwest's open seating policy, but its never been an issue for me. On the return leg of this last flight was on a brand new 737-800, only two months old and still had that new plane smell. Both of my flights left on time and landed early. I have no complaints about my experience."
"""my preferred airline""","Baltimore to Wichita with Southwest Airlines. I purchased two tickets for two people under one reservation. I needed to change the return flight for one of these tickets without changing the flight for everyone on the reservation. Since you cannot do this online without changing the entire reservation, I was able to get my flight changed with one simple phone call that lasted all of 8 minutes including the automated menu and hold time. This change also did not cost me extra! This was a nice surprise considering is took me 6 months to get American Airlines to acknowledge that they need to reimburse me for a flight I was never on! It was pleasant calling 1 number and speaking to a person rather then calling 13 different numbers and getting the same automated message. This great costumer service plus two free bags to check makes Southwest my preferred airline."
"""service has gone too far downhill""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Austin to Phoenix. Southwest Airlines used to be my favorite airline to fly particularly because of how easy it was to cancel and change flights, their rewards program, and especially how helpful their attendants were. Over time, some of their best value points have changed. Their reward system has made it more difficult to receive reward flights. There was a time that you could show up to the airport early, and if their was a seat available on an earlier flight, they would accommodate you, but they no longer do this without charging you the fare difference which is really expensive on a day of flight. I must say worst of all is their service and customer service. Each Southwest Airlines personnel that you deal with from the time you check in, until exiting the plane is rude or in a bad mood, unwilling to help or accommodate your needs. I have a service animal, and three times, at three different points within one round trip experience I was harassed after being cleared twice. I was humiliated and embarrassed. I will no longer fly with SWA unfortunately. I truly used to enjoy the experience, but their service has gone too far downhill."
"""far from a pleasant experience""","✅ Verified Review | My go to airline is always Southwest because of the great prices and friendly customer service. Unfortunately, this time around was far from a pleasant experience. Flew from Dallas to Kansas City. It was my first time checking a car seat and stroller at the gate so I wasn't quite sure of the process. The woman 'helping' was rude, and even made a snide comment in regards to me not understanding where to sign the liability tags. We, my 2 young daughter's (1 & 11) and myself, loaded the plane last. I was concerned about having 2 seats together, and the stewardess was less than accommodating. She did say she would find 2 middle seats close together but that was the best she could do. Fortunately, an older gentleman gave his seat up for us to sit next to each other. I graciously thanked the man, and then thanked the stewardess whom then told me not to thank her and that I needed to thank him. Thankfully the gentleman who was collecting boarding passes was the only pleasant encounter I had. He insisted on taking the stroller and car seat for us because our hands were full, and made sure to go ahead of us and tell the flight crew that we would need 2 seats together so they could begin working on it. Clearly the accommodation wasn't taken into consideration but I appreciate this man for being the only thing positive thing I can say about Southwest during this trip."
"""terrible customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Phoenix to Austin. I typically fly Southwest for their exceptional customer service, low fares, and ease of use. However, this past year flying with them has been awful. Terrible customer service in Phoenix, comparable fares to other airlines (no real savings), delayed flights without notice, their systems breech, and finally how the company slashed how much airline points were worth on their rewards credit card. Not worth it, next time I'll pay the extra $10 for a reliable Delta flight."
"""flight returning was horrific""","Phoenix to Seattle. My flight from Seattle to Phoenix I would rate that trip an 8/9 score (flight attendants were very friendly and helpful from the time I checked in until my exit from the plane. Their concern was that I was comfortable and in the least amount of pain throughout the flying experience with them). Return flight was a whole different type of experience. My flight returning from Phoenix to Seattle (flight 2193) was horrific. I have disabilities that require a cane and a wheel chair at times. During the pre board the wheel chair assisted individuals were squeezed in between other passengers loading (very chaotic) we were barely noticed that we needed to board before the crowds pushed in. The employee that seemed to be in charge at the time, taking the tickets grabbed my wheel chair and quickly/aggressively pushed my wheel chair so fast/hard over the turns and bumps in the ramp that I told him twice to stop and slow down. He was rude to customers loading the plane. He left me and walked away at the entrance of the plane (did not secure the wheel chair, lift the foot pads or help get the luggage off of my lap or give me my cane). I was then met by another rude Southwest flight attendant that just watched me struggle to get out of the wheelchair and try to set my luggage down. She did not once offer to help in anyway. I told her I need to get the luggage in the overhead bin and she just stared at me with an attitude on her face/body language. I finally said that my luggage would just sit there because I couldn't put it in the overhead bin. She finally grabbed the bag and put it up. I asked for my cane that was put in the overhead area so I could use the rest room and again with the attitude when assistance was needed. When it was time to exit the plane not one Southwest employee helped any or the 8 disabled customers with luggage or anything. The customers on the flight are the ones that assisted the disabled customers."
"""Southwest delivers a fine product""","Reno to Las Vegas return. I fly this route several times a year and Southwest delivers a fine product. This time we were traveling with our 90 year old father who requires assistance and wheelchair which we requested. The wheelchair was waiting for us at the airport when we arrived and we were assisted by very nice ground staff all the way to entering the plane. We had to gate check his walker which was promptly waiting for us when we arrived in Las Vegas along with a wheelchair and more assistance from the ground crew. It was all very well done. On our return flight we ran into all kinds of horrible traffic delays due to the Presidential Debate taking place just a few blocks away from the airport. The highways and roads were all closed leading to the airport so when we realized that we would not make our flight we called Customer Service, explained our situation and rebooked for a later flight. The agent was understanding, very pleasant and had us rebooked at no charge within 5 minutes. Upon arrival at the airport a wheelchair was waiting and again the ground crew offered great assistance all the way to the plane. We again gate checked his walker and it was waiting for us upon arrival in Reno along with a wheelchair. Overall I was very impressed by the way Southwest worked with us both on the ground and in the air. Job well done."
"""you can't do better than Southwest""","✅ Verified Review | Heavy headwind extended the flight to 4.5 hours. Southwest doesn't control the wind however, they did make the slightly longer flight highly entertaining. About half way to Seattle, the flight attendants decided we needed to play Blackout Bingo. Seriously funny with the quips from the flight crew including the pilot and co-pilot. The flight crew did everything possible to make the flight entertaining. Kudos to the Southwest crew for going above and beyond to make the passengers enjoy a somewhat long flight enjoyable. I really enjoyed the safety briefing where they said ""In case Southwest Airlines becomes Southwest Cruise Lines"" when showing the safety jackets. This is a ""No Frills"" airline. You don't pay for checked luggage. The price you're shown is the total price without added expense. Yes, I paid $40 for expedited boarding but that was my choice to avoid having a middle seat. If you want to save some cash yet have a fun flight, you can't do better than Southwest."
"""this is ridiculous""","✅ Verified Review | I have flown this airline several times over the past several months and somehow they've found a way to delay the flight just about every time. I understand that things happen from time to time but this is ridiculous. Flew from Birmingham to Tulsa via Houston. Southwest, you are keeping people away from their families / jobs and you couldn't care less. Get your systems together and provide an airline that you can actually count on."
"""horrible customer service""","✅ Verified Review | Newark to Houston via St Louis with Southwest Airlines. Horrible customer service and staff seem clueless. This is my third experience where the plane is late, stuck on tarmac, or refueling. Not once an acknowledgement that inconvenience has happened on their end. I would think twice before recommending Southwest to friends and family."
"""couldn't have been more helpful""","Atlanta to Sacramento via Denver with Southwest Airlines. I had to switch flights on the way back from Atlanta. My flight to Phoenix was delayed due to work at the airport. The delay meant I wouldn't make the flight to Sacramento. I had to fly from Atlanta to Denver and on to Sacramento. Because of the switch I was the last one on the plane both times and stuck in middle seats after getting A boarding with the original flights. A Southwest flight attendant though saved the day. On the Denver to Sacramento trip he asked me if I knew the latest score of the Giants-Cubs game. I was wearing a Giants shirt. I said I had to board right before the ninth inning. He told me to log on to the plane's wi-fi, but my phone was near dead and I needed it to get picked up in Sacramento. So this attendant goes back and gets his iPad so I can watch the end of the game. The flight attendant couldn't have been more helpful. Way to save the day Southwest."
"""professional work ethic""","✅ Verified Review | Orlando to Baltimore Washington. We headed to Orlando for our couple vacation. Beautiful, until Hurricane Matthew showed up. We had to leave 2 days earlier, 6th October. Very anxious moments indeed. Southwest gate and ticket agents assisted us greatly from being on ""standby"" to being the last 3 passengers to board non stop to BWI. These ladies are professionals who under pressure got us as passengers to our destinations safely. Please thank the professional pilots, flight attendants and ground crew for their outstanding performance and professional work ethic in such a time of crisis."
"""I recommend Southwest Airlines""","Long Island to Orlando. Very pleasant, the flight was easy the other passengers weren't disruptive. Islip check in was quick, boarding was like 2 hours or so late because I flew on July 4th weekend. I flew in the Boeing 737 in Heart One livery a nice plane, though I didn't get window seat the flight was still good. I recommend Southwest Airlines."
"""no assigned seats are a problem""","Tampa to St. Louis with Southwest Airlines. No assigned seats are a problem. If you are lucky, you are in the A group to board ahead of B and C group, but people who paid an extra fee to board first save seats for their party (who have not paid the fee) and you can end up sitting further back. I paid the fee last time and another passengers was saving a seat across the aisle with their purse. Another was saving 2seats for companions in the C boarding group. The flight attendants see this all the time and do nothing about it and let it happen. I no longer want to fly Southwest - it is too frustrating."
"""lost a long-time customer""","✅ Verified Review | Orlando to Houston via San Antonio. Other than slight delays, I have never had a problem with Southwest Airlines. However what happened today will result in me never flying with them again. My mother needs special assistance, and it is not allowed to make a disabled person reveal whatever it is that makes them disabled! Because my mother does not ""look"" like she needs assisantance, a staff member made her describe what made her need assistance, and behaved in the most intolerant way. I will never be back. Southwest has lost a long-time customer, and my respect."
"""usually had good experiences""","✅ Verified Review | I'm going to start off by saying that the check-in agent was very friendly and helpful, making sure I knew where to go not only in Norfolk International, but also in Baltimore. Because I paid the cheapest fare, I was one of the last people on. Luckily it wasn't a full flight so I still got an aisle seat. The plane was clean. The flight attendant giving the safety announcement, as per apparent Southwest policy, made the speech into a comedy routine (much needed on a red-eye). For those who don't know, the flight from Norfolk to Baltimore usually takes a maximum of fifty minutes; this time it was more along the lines of thirty-five. Despite this short timeframe, however, the crew made sure we all got our snacks and drinks (though I didn't have any). I have usually had good experiences flying on Southwest, and this flight was no exception."
"""say that they are brilliant""","New Orleans to San Diego. My partner and I were visiting the US from Australia and we have taken 4 internal flights with Southwest Airlines in the last 2 weeks - we have to say that they are brilliant. We bought ""wanna getaway"" tickets that were cheap and all flights left on time and there were no problems. I read online previously that you must check in exactly 24hours before your flight to make sure you get your seats, which we always did (we set alarms to remind us 24 hours before on the dot!) Staff were friendly and we loved that this airline has no hidden costs and a big suitcase each flies free. Would definitely recommend these guys!!"
"""incompetent phone staff""","✅ Verified Review | Reno to Los Angeles return. Southwest Airlines is spiraling into a bad, dark place. Seems it has now become SWA company policy to have even the most pedestrian 70 minute flight delayed by more than 2 hours. There is no reason for this. There was no weather. There was no equipment failure. There were no technical glitches. And to boot the phone agent kept trying to get me to take a standby flight to Las Vegas instead of getting me home to LAX where my car, family, life and all that matters to me are. Not only can this airline not handle the simple logistics of shuttling equipment back and forth between two cities that take 70 minutes to fly between, their incompetent phone staff cannot understand the difference between Los Angeles, CA and Las Vegas, NV."
"""becoming as bad as Delta""","✅ Verified Review | Baltimore to Las Vegas with Southwest Airlines. Flying home after a weekend with friends our flight was delayed as the aircraft was stuck in San Diego due to fog. Our original flight was due to leave at 11:10am. The fog was cleared by about 10am by the weather service. Still this 40 minute flight has not left yet and is now scheduled to leave after noon. We were rebuffed after several attempts to rebook and told no available seating although when you go online there are expensive tickets available later in the day. The gate representative basically said it is not her fault and she can't help us or do anything to compensate us as there was fog in San Diego. If we can't get out today she will try to rebook us tomorrow. We can email to complain and as previous reviewers have said, that's not very effective either. Southwest used to be my go to airline - now it's becoming as bad as Delta and that's pretty bad."
"""So awesome, thank you""","✅ Verified Review | Ft Lauderdale to Boston. I've always flown Southwest Airlines. Never had a problem and actually enjoy flying with them - crew is extremely friendly and quite funny. Today I decided to write a review because I left an item on the plane. One of the flight attendants remembered where I was going and came to my gate with my item. I am extremely grateful and was so surprised! So awesome, thank you!!"
"""impressed how quickly they found a solution""","✅ Verified Review | Originally booked a flight from San Jose to Phoenix (and return) with Southwest Airlines. At the airport, the flight from San Jose was cancelled due to mechanical problems with the plane. I received a text alert even before an announcement was made at the boarding gate, so I made my way to a customer service counter. The agent was fast and to the point, while remaining courteous. I ended up being re-routed through John Wayne (Orange County) airport, and eventually arrived at Phoenix less than 3 hours after my original flight. For my troubles, I received a $200 voucher, which is more than what I paid for the round-trip. I was impressed by how quickly they found a solution to the cancelled flight, and amazed by the financial compensation."
"""incredible customer service""","Los Angeles to Portland. Southwest has some incredible customer service. I completely messed up and accidently missed my flight to go back home. I briefly explained what had happened and without hesitation, the very friendly female clerk got me onto another flight within a few minutes. There was no charge, no hassle, and before I knew it, I had another flight back to Portland. Very appreciative of the great customer service and the williningness to work with their customers."
"""great first impression""","✅ Verified Review | Traveled by myself from Grand Rapids to Philadelphia with a stop in Chicago Midway. Looked at prices for other airlines and I saw nothing less than $350 round trip. A co-worker suggested I check Southwest Airlines website since they don't pop up on Priceline and other travel websites and found the same flight for $240. Good first impression there. When I arrived I learned that my first flight from GRR to MDW was delayed 45 minutes as the plane was stuck in IAD - however, the attendants seemed very eager to get us to our destination and boarded those with close connecting flights first so they wouldn't miss them. I was impressed even further by the friendliness of the ground service. Great sense of humor. This was a reoccurring theme on each flight. Planes were clean and well maintained. I understand some of the planes received new seats which supposedly are far superior to the old ones. Wasn't super comfortable but better than any I've sat in on an American Airlines flight. I purchased wifi for 8 bucks and it lasted for the entire day, so I used it on both flights even though I had to change planes. Cabin service was efficient with a large selection of drinks. Attendants were very personable and helpful. I like how they read gate info before landing. Also worth noting that I travelled alone. I can see how their open seating process could negatively effect groups of people traveling together. They do offer family boarding after the A group boards which was neat to see. I landed a first row seat 3 of my 4 flights and it was very spacious but all carry on must be stored above. If you're traveling light it's worth climbing over a few people as the leg room was fantastic. Overall great first impression of Southwest. No large complaints worth noting. Can't beat their prices. It's hard to find good rates to bigger cities when flying out of an airport as small as Grand Rapids. Will definitely fly again."
"""refused to reply to my emails""","Nashville to Tampa with Southwest Airlines. My flight was cancelled with minimum notice. They had the entire full flight go to the 2 agents at the gate to rebook (they did not even tell people there was an option to go up front to check-in). Being A-List Preferred I called the number and they tried to put me in an open seat on the 1:55pm flight but they could not help because somehow SWA closed making reservation changes to them from flight 37. After the A List plus folks could not help I went to front check in but they had no ability to get me out until the 9:45pm flight. Despite my Business Select fare I got a boarding pass with position B5 on it. When I complained I paid the high fare and was A-List Preferred they said they could do nothing but I could try to better myself (13 hours later) at the gate. They also said if I called back Monday they would connect me with customer service. In addition to going out 13 hours later I had to wait 1 hour to get my bag back and leaving the airport paid $12 for parking that would have been included in my regular parking fee for 24 hours. On Monday I again called the A List Preferred number to be connected to the customer service to complain as I was told Sunday. They instead told me to send an e-mail. You have no idea how frustrating this has all been. Not only did I not get to meet the people I was to have lunch with Sunday I arrived at my hotel well after 1AM (flight landed at 12:20AM) to have to be at my office a 7AM meeting. I did want to talk to someone who will explain why SWA will not let me verbally complain and maybe get SWA to think how badly they handle these situations. To this date they have refused to reply to my emails."
"""crew was very friendly""","Dallas to Fort Lauderdale with Southwest Airlines. 1.5 hour delay, had to switch gates and planes mid boarding due to hydraulic fluid leak. While it was an inconvenience at least we had peace of mind. Safery first. The Captain and crew took the time to explain the problem and were prompt and courteous getting us boarded on the new plane and on our way. On our flight back to Dallas (flight 3137) the flight crew was very friendly and made our early morning flight a breeze. Loved the jokes and sense of humor. We have been on other airlines where the flight crew were not so friendly and almost rude so it was very refreshing to see some sense of humor in the air especially on an early morning flight."
"""a wonderful experience""","On my recent trip from San Francisco retuning home to San Diego with Southwest Airlines, I had a wonderful experience with a kind and knowledgeable flight attendants. Attentive and customer service oriented. It made my experience on this short flight memorable and reminded me how positive interactions can make something mundane really meaningful."
"""rewards card going straight to the shredder""","Las Vegas to Raleigh Durham with Southwest Airlines. I don't travel often, however the few times in the year when I do, our flights with Southwest are always delayed. Not for 30 minutes or an hour. Delays that are two thirds of the actual flight. One of our recent flights from San Francisco to Orange County was delayed longer than if we driven. Southwest being cheap and squeezing all their margins. This will be the last time we are fly Southwest. That rewards card is going straight to the shredder when we get back."
"""plane was clean and comfortable""","✅ Verified Review | My Southwest flight took off on time from Fort Myers and landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule in Pittsburgh. Plane was clean and comfortable. Mixed drinks are only $5, snacks are good. Boarding is first come, first serve, but my daughter and husband and I all found seats next to each other even boarding in the ""C"" line. Luggage all arrived at our destination. Only negative is that they charge $8 for WiFi, which is excessive for a 2 hour flight. Will definitely choose them again - their fares are reasonably priced for a carrier that doesn't charge you to check luggage."
"""Southwest get new management?""","Albuquerque, NM to San Antonio, TX via Dallas, Love Field TX. I have been making about 8 to 10 flights a year for at least 9 years. My family lives in RI, and I live in NM. So I travel cross country once or twice a year, plus vacation and work trips to the Bahamas, Florida, Quebec, Mexico, and last winter Cambodia. I have always attempted to fly Southwest Airlines in the past, whenever traveling (domestic) to a location that they have service to, and I generally try to avoid American Airlines. Over the last few years flying is less and less of a faster trip, due to lengthy waits in security, and the expectation that we travelors arrive at the airport earlier and earlier, as well as layovers that get longer and more frequent delays. In the last couple of years I have come to expect that, unless I am flying on the very first flight of the day, I will be delayed. I have mentally added that time to overall travel time, when planning a trip. Southwest always seems to deliver that midday delay, and I now expect it. Today, Southwest outdid themselves. I think I may finally reached the point where voluntarily flying is perhaps no longer worth it. Maybe I would rather stay home. There have been several moments today when I wished that I could leave the airport and just go home. Why am I so set on spending the time and money to somewhere else anyway? I can go swimming in Albuquerque. The first such moment was when I got to the airport at 7:00 am for my 8:55 flight only to discover that it does not exist anymore. It was posted as delayed, now it's just gone. I have to wait until I am called to be told how I will be rerouted. So now I am leaving an hour and 50 minutes later, to make a Dallas flight that will take off about 2 hours later. So I can still pick up my rental car during daylight. I make it to Dallas, I get on the plane, we are a bit delayed because we need to get some more gas because we need to fly around some heavy traffic to get to San Antonio. No we are now waiting an additional hour and 45, due to bad weather. Well, ok, I can still do my drive before it gets dark (I've never driven in San Antonio). I can even get off the plane if I want, I will just have to reboard (because that is so much fun). So it is really pretty hot in here, but it is too late to go home. We can leave now, (so they say). We just have to wait for the passengers to get back on the plane. Did Southwest get new management? Is this a new marketing scheme?"
"""no compassion, not friendly, not helpful""","Writing this review not as a passenger but as the uncle of my nephew who attempted to fly from Chicago Midway to Albuquerque on WN 563 on July 21st. Yes - Southwest had a computer meltdown and their flights were all messed up. This has happened before to them and other airlines. But alas it always comes down to how an airline handles things like this that differentiates them from others. My nephew is Italian and doesn't speak English fluently and is 14, so I needed to get the Escort pass from the ticket counter. The line was over 1,000 people long if not more, stretching into back halls. I told the SW agents at the line entrances I just needed to get the Escort pass as he can't go thru alone. No - no help. Rude people who just say - get in line. There was no one at the Business Fare line - literally no one - and she wouldn't just let me go up there to get the pass. I had used a Skycap to check his bag in as that line was only 50 people long, so literally just needed the agent to give me the pass. Not a single SW person helped me - but going back to the Skycap - he did! He stopped what he was doing and walked me back to the counter and had an agent quickly issue me the pass. So simple - didn't really stop the process of handling other passengers. Just for this I wouldn't fly SW again - there was no reason the Biz counter couldn't have helped me (and 2 other passengers needing just a quick minute with an agent. So we go thru security - eat and go to the gate where it says ""on time"". Some flights delayed, some cancelled, some on time. They board other flights, at our boarding time they have people line up, flight attendants already on board. Then an announcement: ""Flight 536 is cancelled, we have no pilots, please get in line for rebooking"". No apology - in fact the 4 hours at Midway not a single SWA agent said I'm sorry for what was happening - just deal with it. So I get on the SWA app and the only flight I can get for my nephew is on the 23rd of June. Ok - so now ask an agent how I can get his bag. No - no way, we are not pulling bags from flights. I said he is 14 and has no clothes here as he is visiting. Sorry - we are not pulling bags. I said some choice words to her and then she says to speak to a supervisor. Wait 45 min in line - the supervisor says no - with a smile - and I can try to go to baggage claim and see if someone there would help. So I go to baggage claim - and the agent there is friendly - but she is just guiding people as that line is 20 people long. She said the bag will go to ABQ and just let it go. If I wait in the line they may not pull it, or if they do it could be hours. At least she was friendly. So for 2 days my nephew will not have any of his things - not a dire situation - he can wear my clothes. But again - it was just the sheer nature of the SWA agents. No compassion, not friendly, not helpful. I will never spend a single penny at Southwest again. SWA has gotten too big for its britches - they used to be good in the 80s and 90s, now just one of the Big 4 and treating passengers like cattle. Lets see if the flight tomorrow goes out on time or at all, I have my fingers crossed."
"""no other flights available""","The customers of flight #1647 from Hartford to Orlando were mislead and given empty hopes. We were told at about 12.15 pm that our flight was an hour delayed. Then soon after canceled. Next, we were told, ""please sit calmly Southwest will figure this out."" Finally, no other flights available, this flight is canceled all together. All other bookings were available until Sunday July 24th. Useless for us, since we were coming back on Sunday. I shifted gears quicker than Southwest and booked a flight with JetBlue for an additional $1000 to fly out the next day. I have been trying to contact Southwest online or via telephone call with no success. This is an awful way of doing business."
"""a very comfortable experience""","I recently flew on a Southwest Airlines new 737-800 from St. Louis to Washington National and it was a very comfortable experience. The flight was full going there and on the way back but the cabin crew was very helpful and able to get to us very quickly. When we checked our bags, even with it being about 50 of us in the group, they were able to take care of us pretty quickly along with taking care of the other people not with our group at the same time. Overall, I would recommend flying with Southwest."
"""unbelievably rude""","✅ Verified Review | We have always had a great experience when flying with Southwest and with their customer service. For this reason, we have always been willing to pay the extra dollars to book our flights through them, as opposed to booking with one of the cheaper airlines. However, the last 3 times we have flown Southwest have been just awful. They lost our car seat the first time, our luggage the second time, and then the third time we experienced a 3.5 hour delay followed by a cancelled flight at 9.30pm. On top of this, we have encountered terrible customer service every step of the way in dealing with these stressful circumstances. Each time we traveled the personnel working at the ticket counter have been unbelievably rude. Great way to start the trip. When items were lost, instead of being helpful and accommodating, the customer service agent working in lost baggage was very brusque and actually yelled at us, and then refused to do something as simple as validate a $7 parking ticket for my husband who had to park and come in to help me with the situation since I was traveling alone with our 6 month old. Finally, when we were flying home to Denver, our flight was delayed 3.5 hours and then cancelled. The entire time the woman working the gates to the flight was yelling at people and being extremely rude. We all had to wait 1-2 hours in line to rebook our flights, and then we found out the next day when we called in that they never even rebooked a flight for us. We will be leaving 2 days after our expected and paid for departure date. On top of all of this, we have not been compensated for any of these inconveniences."
"""went the extra mile""","✅ Verified Review | Portland to Boise with Southwest. Our 12 year old son flew by himself and had to change planes with a 2 hour layover. Since he's 12, he's an unaccompanied minor. Southwest employees were so kind and generous by offering a meet and assist during his plane change and layover. Plus, they went the extra mile by calling us to confirm our son had landed and was in their care. They even put him on the phone to speak with us. We have always received excellent service with Southwest. This was exceptional service and we highly recommend."
"""only draw back is open seating""","Portland to Los Angeles wit Southwest. Great Airline. They sell fares based upon one way. It is great if you want to fly into one city and out of another city. No bag fee's or change fee's. The only draw back is open seating based upon the 24 hour check in when you are signed group A. B, or C. That is ok because the aircraft they use are 737's and the connections give me a chance to stretch my leg's. They also offer a beverage and snack service."
"""energetic and jovial flight attendants""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Southwest from Phoenix to Orange County on a Saturday evening. I checked-in using self-serve kiosk at the airport. Kiosk gave me a temporary pass that I needed to collect my real boarding pass at the gate. Security lines were very short in Phoenix that evening. Agent at the gate was very courteous and professional despite having just dealt with an unhappy customer before me. Inside the cabin, I was surprised by how energetic and jovial the flight attendants were despite the flight being on a Saturday evening."
"""definitely fly in the future""","I flew Southwest Airlines with my band on our spring break trip. The cabin staff was amazing and very accommodating. We took off on-time with no problems or delays. The airport staff was amazing, I accidentally left my bag in the gate area and the gate agent walks onto the plane with my duffel bag. Inflight service with Free snacks and drinks. The new plane was beautiful with the mood lighting. Will definitely fly in the future!"
"""severely disappointed""","I started my travel today with a 7.25am Southwest Airlines flight from NY, with Orlando being my final destination on a 9.45am. As of now, it is 1pm and I am still in the connecting airport set to depart at 5pm. A 7 hour delay you ask? What possibly could have happened? All we are told is that there is an equipment issue and we are to wait. There have been 4 flights from BWI to MCO set to depart after mine that have already left as we wait 7 hours for a flight. Severely disappointed. I will not be flying SW again."
"""Southwest works great for me""","Reno to Las Vegas return with Southwest Airlines. Third trip this year on this route and it is a very consistent one. Usually on time or a few minutes delay but nothing to worry about. Service is good, ground staff were excellent as we were running late and checked in about 30 minutes before take off. Reno airport is a breeze to go through so never any lines at TSA. Our bags made it on to the flight even though we got the dreaded Late Check-In tag. Quick flight to Vegas, friendly FA's, pilot communicated with us, typical beverage and peanut service, bags quick to pick up in Vegas and then the same coming back to Reno. Southwest works great for me."
"""uncomfortable to begin with""","Orlando to Hartford. My sister and I got split up while boarding this flight. We were on extreme opposite sides of the plane. We hadn't flown in a long time so it was uncomfortable to begin with. Of course, I was not okay with this and began to complain. The flight attendant said that I needed to take a seat. So I did and I told him how unsatisfied I was with the airline. He was like well you're still going to need to take a seat. I sat down and said that I'm going to write a complaint about the airline. What if I had children, someone who had extreme anxiety, or another issue. Luckily that was not the case, but they should do something about the seating process. When we purchased the tickets it said entertainment such as tv, movies and wifi would be included. There was not one tv and the wifi did not work."
"""last time I will fly Southwest""","Denver to Cancun with Southwest Airlines. We were a group travelling for a wedding on 1 flight. No one was able to sit together. The boarding process is ridiculous, you have the first people boarding sitting in the aisle or window seats, leaving the middle seats for the tailend of boarding. Out of 20 people in our group we were able to sit together here and there. Additionally, why allow large carry on luggage? It would make more sense to limit the carry on because that is what slows down the boarding process, not assigned seating. This is most likely the last time I will fly Southwest - there is no care or concern for families traveling together, even if I have to pay more it will be worth it to have the ability to travel with my family and friends."
"""very unhappy Southwest customer""","Manchester–Boston to San Diego. So I purchase the ""Early Bird"" option five months before my scheduled flight. My daughter is on same flight and does not purchase ""Early Bird"" option. Southwest advertises ""Early Bird"" option completes your check in for you and I get my preboard A-31. So my daughter checks in 24 hours before scheduled flight and gets preboard A-30. So I pay for ""Early Board"" option and she boards ahead of me ? I call and was told to complete my flight then file a complaint? Think they would fix issue before wronging a loyal Southwest customer. I file complaint after completing travel and was reimbursed the payment for the ""Early Bird"" option but was told they will do it this time but sometimes it happens? How many others boarded ahead of me without paying the extra fee? Sounds like a scam to me! Have you seen this Southwest Commercial on television: Transfarency - We don't dream up ways to trick you into paying more. Sounds like they did and customers don't realize. Very unhappy Southwest customer."
"""why bother to upgrade""","Why bother to upgrade on Southwest? Flew from Providence to Tampa. On the first flight there were 17 wheelchairs that delayed the flight for over 25 minutes. We ended up more than halfway back in the plane despite the A boarding. On landing, hearing first on last off, only 3 individuals required assistance. Arriving early at the airport today I observed six people going to Baltimore in wheelchairs, 3 walked a fair distance to get coffee, afterwards one even ""hobbled up"" to the gate person to make sure she didn't need ""real documentation"". On my boarding later there was a family of 6, one about aged six, pre-boarding. I asked and was told it was a disability issue. Really? Four or five people needed for one teenager or maybe the 6/year old? As a former special needs and kindergarten teacher I get it, but as a consumer I know an abuse of the system too. I will not pay to upgrade and perhaps not fly Southwest again. I don't think the airline will change as long as this is ignored by consumers."
"""helpless and uncomfortable""","Orlando to Las Vegas with Southwest. All the services were ok but I was traveling with my wife who is almost deaf, or hearing impaired, and I always travel with her and I sit close to her to assist her with anything. The way Southwest do seating we did not find seat together and we were far awy from each other, and it was only after I claimed loudly the inconvenience that a kind passenger moved from their seat and allowed us to seat together. But the flight crew never have the courtesy to make that kind of acomodation. I felt helpless and uncomfortable with that."
"""open seating ridiculous""","✅ Verified Review | Houston Hobby to Akron with Southwest Airlines. They have gotten rid of all military benefits. The open seating is ridiculous because you can't even sit with your spouse. As far as I'm concerned it's the airlines way of making people pay extra for an upgrade. Neither of the planes we were on had Wifi, inconvenient for people who have business matters. The check in counter was total chaos and it took us 20 min to get our boarding passes."
"""experienced 2 rude flight attendants""","✅ Verified Review | Flew Baltimore to Louisville. This was the 2nd time I flew with Southwest and I experienced 2 rude flight attendants. I was the last to board because my 2.5 year old had to go to the bathroom as people were getting in line to start boarding. Thank goodness we did not miss the flight. When we boarded (last) there were no two seats left together and an older male attendant muttered ""that's what happens when you board last when you have a child with you,"" as he passed us by. I was greatly offended as I could not control the circumstances. Two kind gentlemen gave up their seats for us. My son fell asleep soon after take off and the window blind was jammed/broken in a half closed position with the sunlight in my son's face. There was a ripped page of one of their brochures so I tucked it under the window blind. As we were about to land, another attendant annoyingly asked, ""Did you rip that? Give it to me"" and took it. How rude."
"""will reconsider future trips""","✅ Verified Review | Another Southwest Airlines delayed flight, from Denver to Los Angeles. Total delay was 1 hour. The plane actually came back 30 minutes earlier than expected but no passenger boarding until the full hour. Not sure why passengers were not boarding when the plane arrived. First time Southwest passenger and I will reconsider future trips with this airline."
"""every flight has been delayed""","✅ Verified Review | I've flown 3 flights with Southwest in the last 5 days, all of them short flights. Either Los Angeles to Phoenix or to Las Vegas. Every flight has been delayed. What's the point if I can drive there faster. Airfares have been far too high for poor service. No longer customer focused. I'll drive."
"""no help whatsoever""","Very poor customer service, flight from Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale was delayed 3 times, finally after 4 hours, we were given the option to fly to Orlando. Well that flight was delayed as well. Ended up in Orlando at 3am with no place to stay and unable to drive 3 hours home. Called customer service and was flat out told I was on my own, no help whatsoever. First time and last time I will fly Southwest Airlines."
"""prices can't be beat""","I fly from San Diego to San Antonio around 5 times per year, round trip. I always fly with Southwest. Their prices can't be beat for the quality you get. I personally like the seating setup, where you choose your seat based on a ""first come, first served"" basis regarding check in time. If you are traveling with young children, they do allow you to do family boarding after the small first round of people, so you can almost always find seats together. Seat room is a bit better than average, but nothing to write home about. Two free checked bags plus a carryon and personal item is unreal. Where Southwest really shines, however, is their customer service. They're funny, helpful, and always seem to be smiling. The flight attendants are especially good with kids. Overall, if you're used to high class flying, this may not be the airline for you as it lacks the preselected seating option and has only one class. But if you just want to be comfortable and have a good experience, I wouldn't choose anything but Southwest."
"""luggage was soaked from rain""","The one time I chose to fly with Southwest instead of Delta like I usually do, I had the worst traveling experience ever. I thought my one hour flight from Utah to Las Vegas would be easy enough, and I would have no problem getting there efficiently. Boy was I wrong Not only did they delay the flight 7 hours, but when I finally received my luggage it was soaked from rain as if they had dumped it into a river, and it ruined all my belongings. I will never fly with them again."
"""their seats seem wider""","Oakland to Houston via Orange County with Southwest. Don't care for the open seating but it seems to work pretty efficiently even when the computers go down. Crew were friendly but the most impressive part of the flight was the very smooth landing, both times! Not my first time flying Southwest, wish I could always fly with them. Their seats seem wider than the other airlines."
"""let me pick my seat""","I paid $460 for a seat on a late night flight. The overhead light was broken, leaving me in pitch black darkness. For $460 I expect an overhead light. I hate the boarding scheme, it takes time and attention on the day prior to travel to deal with the check in in a way that doesn't leave me the worst seat on the plane. I hate the competition in boarding. I am heavily pressured by staff to find a seat, but I can't even see what seats are available in order to make an informed choice. (I hardly call that a choice). I hate how people hold seats besides their own for their own purposes, so if you want that seat you have fight for it and sit next to a hostile person. Please, Southwest Airlines, let me pick my seat ahead of time."
"""delayed not once, but twice""","I recently traveled with Southwest Airlines from Hartford to Orlando as part of my spring break trip. This was the worst experience I have had with Southwest as I have traveled with them multiple times with no problems. Our first flight out of Hartford was delayed not once, but twice. After that we had circled in the air for 2 hours because of weather (which I understand can't be controlled) but once we finally landed we sat on the tarmac for around an hour waiting for a gate to open. My returning flight was also delayed. A vacation that was supposed to be stress free turned into the most stressful travel time I've had. Unfortunately due to this experience I am unsure if I'll be comfortable making travel plans with Southwest again."
"""Flight attendants were superb""","Boston to Chicago, and the Flight attendants were superb. It was my 75th birthday (even though I said 39 again!) they invited me to come to front and the choir from a Chicago area high school sang Happy Birthday to me. Apparently turning 75 made me clumsy because I spilt ginger ale all over myself and attendant responded immediately with paper towels. They were very helpful and considerate, and throughout trip cheerful to all. I was on Flight #4293 that left Boston at 8:40 am. Would appreciate my message being passed on to those flight attendants."
"""never been treated so poorly""","✅ Verified Review | Minneapolis to Tampa return, and Southwest stranded us in Tampa for 3 days. No hotel or car. They told us all after we boarded the plane that the pilot was called away to a different flight. However, the representative then told us the pilot timed out. They used the excuse of weather to not have to pay for our hotels. I am an A-preferred member and have never been treated so poorly. I tried to call as I located two separate flights to another city that would get us home earlier. Southwest will not make it right, unless I want to pay extra. So, my daughter misses school, I miss work, and we incur three extra days of travel costs. And nothing but an apology from Southwest."
"""finished with Southwest""","San Jose, CA to Tulsa. Avoiding Southwest Airlines in the future. My husband is an A list member. He flies this route a dozen times a year. We ""thought "" we liked Southwest until we had a major problem over Easter weekend. I ended up having to make a 9 hour trip by car to pick him up due 100% to Southwest and their flight crews ineptness. I figured come Monday I would be calling and getting a full refund. Not even close. Southwest customer service is the worst. They are rude and lack any empathy or responsibility. Took me 3 days of holding and calling and almost outright abuse before I got a partial refund. You sure do you find out what a company is really like when you have a problem. And this company is the lowest in customer service that I have ever seen. So much for being an A list member. We are finished with Southwest."
"""not fly with Southwest in the future""","Our flights from Houston to Orlando were both delayed. We have 2 younger children ages 10 and 11. It was incredibly difficult to get seats with them even though our boarding group is group B. Because Southwest Airlines does not have pre-assigned seatings, it takes so much longer for everyone to board. Most people leave the middle seats unoccupied as the plane gets filled. So if you have small children, and in our case 2 small children, we have to ask 2-3 people to switch seats so that in case of emergency, we can assist them. I will not fly with Southwest Airlines in the future."
"""will continue to use them""","✅ Verified Review | IND-RSW March 19th and RSW-IND March 25th, Southwest Airlines is the best domestic airline. Prices are comparable to the ULCC's, however you get the service of the legacy airlines. Not to mention how they don't use the Hub and Spoke system where you have to make an annoying stop to go anywhere. I also find their IFE convenient, I loved being able to watch NCAA tournament games during my flight. Southwest Airlines did not disappoint this vacation and I will continue to use them, and get my two free checked bags while I'm at it."
"""crew were friendly""","RNO-LAS roundtrip. Both flights were spot on time. First flight on rather colorful Southwest livery plane (Maryland). The flight was a bit bumpy so the pilot asked that beverage service be halted but the last 15 minutes of the flight was fine so the crew served the whole plane and collected trash in a short matter of time. Also the little girl sitting next to me was celebrating her 6th B-Day and she received special treatment which was nice to see. The flight home was actually ahead of schedule and about 75% full. Said my hello to the lady sitting next to me and before I knew it we were up in the air. Smooth flight home. Flight crew were friendly and didn't even charge for cocktails. Nice! All in all Southwest is consistent in time and service on this route which I take several times a year so I am happy to use their services."
"""most friendly crew""","The crew we had for Southwest Airlines flight 2639 from Minneapolis to El Paso, was amazing. Most friendly crew I have ever seen. It was my 7 year old sons first time flying and they spoiled him. Flying Southwest from now on. They even let him take a picture with the pilot!!"
"""crews were friendly""","Flew a day trip with Southwest Airlines from St. Louis - Omaha and return. This review covers both flights. Flights were on time (within 5 minutes). Plane was clean, crews were friendly. STL-OMA segment was about 75% full and had the standard Southwest beverage and snack service. Return flight was 100% full and due to the brevity of the flight we were served water only plus peanuts. Quite acceptable for a flight just under an hour."
"""honesty and integrity of employees""","My daughter was flying from Rochester to Orlando for a cheer competition in Disney with her team and coach. When she arrived in Orlando she realized she had lost her wallet. I want to compliment the honesty, integrity, and helpfulness of the Southwest employees involved in getting the wallet returned in tact including the cash and gift cards that were inside. Her wallet ended up in Birmingham, Alabama where I was assisted by two extremely helpful staff. They were as extremely helpful in instructing me how to get the wallet mailed back and gave me the good news that the cash and gift cards were still inside. I don't know if a passenger found it and turned it in or if it was one of the crew that found it on the airplane. All I know is I am impressed how this scary experience for my daughter turned out so well because of the quick and honest actions of the Southwest employees. We fly Southwest frequently and will continue to because of the great customer service, affordable fares, and now, the amazing experience of a lost and found item! Thank you Southwest!"
"""WiFi did not work""","Flying Baltimore to Las Vegas with Southwest has been our worst flying experience. If you do not purchase early-bird check in they bill you an additional $40/person to sit together or you can purchase Business Select for an extra $500/person. WiFi charge was $8 which did not work for 70% of flight. Our 5 hours flight was completely uncomfortable the entire way since we were both squashed in middle seats between people we didn't know. I do not see us ever flying with Southwest again!"
"""took exceptional care of us""","Writing to say that Southwest Airlines took exceptional care of us! My husband had a slipped disc in his neck and felt terrible, an agent in the airport noticed, got us a wheel chair and helped us to the check in. They were so kind there and had a wheel hair waiting when we arrived. The steward on our flight # 2890 was so helpful and brought him an ice pack 3 times. Thanks!"
"""they weren't very appreciative""","I was at the airport trying to get early on a flight to San Diego, asked the lady at the gate B15 to get an earlier flight as it was to surprise my daughter for birthday. She looked it up and although there were seats, wanted to charge us nearly 11,000 points. They weren't very appreciative that we've flown with them for years, didn't really care much about helping out. I am not using them whenever possible."
"""get 2 free checked bags""","I thought Southwest Airlines staff and seating were great. You can change you flight (day/time) with no additional fees unless the cost of that day is more, they also give you first come first served seating, and they give you one free drink and snacks on the plane. The downfall is that all their flights have layovers so a trip that would normally be a couple hours ends up being 4-5hrs. You also get 2 free checked bags and free wifi!"
"""better than expected""","Chicago Midway to Tampa. This was my first time flying with my 4 year old son, and it turned out to be a great experience. We missed our flight but Southwest gave us a new flight at no charge that was 2 hours later. When it was time to be seated the customer service was very pleasant. I asked a lot of question because it was my first time flying, also my son's. The staff passed out a free drink and peanuts to all passengers. Being able to bring 2 free bags each passenger plus a free carryon was a win-win situation. I was very pleased to have such a pleasant experience. Everything was better than expected."
"""every excuse imaginable""","Arrived at Mcaron airport on day of flight. Flight was boarded then cancelled. Was put on next available flight which also was cancelled. Ended up being routed to Sacramento. Then it cost me more money to get from Sacramento to reno than the original ticket cost. Cost me $40.00 roundtrip just to pick up my bag at Reno airport. Total cost between airport food gas mileage etc around $380.00 Original ticket $222.98 . I'm a disabled veteran on a fixed income. I asked for a refund of the original ticket cost. Southwest took five business days to approve the refund no thanks to there customer service center. After five days I had to call the corporate office in Dallas and was lucky enough to get someone on the phone who could at the least push my claim through to approval status. I got every every excuse imaginable from there customer service reps but the one constant was that this was there policy on refunds and I would just have to wait. They took my money immediately out of my account when I bought the ticket so why is so hard for them to put it back. Seriously the IRS processes tax returns faster than Southwest will process a customer refund. As of this posting I still have not received my refund and with a holiday weekend here I guess I'll be lucky to see it by next week. Shame on you Southwest airlines. I trusted you would have better business sense than to hold peoples money hostage. Your customer service reps are under trained and give different answers."
"""wasted $13 on wifi service""","Indianapolis to Las Vegas, and flying with Southwest Airlines was one of the worst flying experiences I have had. I paid $8 to have wifi throughout the flight, but any simple google search takes about a minute to load. Netflix does not work on the wifi. After realizing this, I then spent another $5 on a movie to watch. In order to watch the movie in flight, you have to install an app to view it. I installed the app about 13 times, on both Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, however I was still not able to watch the movie that I bought. Overall I wasted $13 on wifi services that are expected to work. Very disappointed."
"""trying to get 25,000 reward miles""","Detroit to Denver. We tried booking tickets using Southwest Rapids reward card immediately after signing up. When we called Chase to sign up they said we could use card once approved but had to contact another branch of Chase to get card number to book tickets. We called Chase-2 and they could not give card number but said if we sign up online we could use the card to book Southwest tickets. We canceled phone activated application and signed up on Southwest online. Account was approved and activated by Chase but could only see the last 4 numbers of account. Security, I get it! So we contacted Chase-3 again and they said we should have had the trip in our Southwest checkout online. I check and we did have the trip in our checkout and still couldn't book the trip. What a run around! We ended up using our DELTA card to book our Southwest trip. We are planning many trips this year so were trying to get the 25,000 reward miles by spending $1000 - no problem! Southwest needs to get with Chase and get their story straight!"
"""choose Southwest again""","We were happy to have a direct Southwest Airlines flight from Buffalo to Las Vegas. The customer service was pleasant. Another reason we would choose Sothwest again is because of the leg room. Compared to our last flight on another airline where we were totally cramped, especially with the person in front of me reclining, I was able to stretch my legs comfortably. I have a broken hip and arthritic knees but was able to sit through the whole flight. I liked the free TV and WIFI also after I was able to connect. Both flights arrived on time. The only negative is the open seating although I was able to sit next to my husband both ways. I would choose Southwest again."
"""get rid of this policy""","Las Vegas to Dallas with Southwest Airlines. The most frustrating and annoying feature about their flight is the first come first serve seating, so if we are traveling as a couple or group, we are able to sit together after the first half is seated. The seats are small and cramped and to have to be squeeze in between two strangers is a pain. We are never flying Southwest again until they get rid of this policy!"
"""genuinely happy to greet us""","Outbound: Sunday, January 24, 2016: Phoenix (PHX) to Ontario (ONT) - Flight 1975 with Southwest Airlines. Inbound: Thursday, January 28, 2016: Ontario (ONT) to Phoenix (PHX) - Flight 182. What a pleasant flying experience this was for us. Check-in agents in both PHX and ONT who seemed genuinely happy to greet us. Flight Attendants on both segments of this trip who appeared to be enjoying their work. A Captain and First Officer who made frequent and informative announcements. No delays at either end. No charge for first two bags. No waiting in line while passengers ahead of you struggled to get roll aboard into overhead bins and lots of room in these bins for hand luggage. Definitely a great airline and wonderful customer service all round. We will continue to travel with Southwest wherever possible."
"""crew was very nice""","Seattle to John Wayne Orange County. I was very skeptical of the seating strategy Southwest Airlines uses but it was actually quite fast and I was able to find a good seat both directions of my trip. The crew was very nice and responsive. I checked my bag for free, there was a snack, I prefer having a screen but the wifi based TV was pretty good."
"""overall not satisfied""","Terribly organized! I have booked my tickets with Southwest Airlines from Atlanta to Las Vegas a month prior to flight with my fiance. At the check-in, we were told that my fiance's ticket was the last ticket available, we did end up getting separate seats at the boarding gate. Once boarded they have asked us to board according to our sections which is completely useless, since you can sit wherever you want. Overall not satisfied, will never fly again."
"""happy with their service""","Perfect flight on the way from Buffalo to Fort Lauderdale with Southwest Airlines. 5 hour mechanical delay on the way to Buffalo. not a lot of fun but staff did a good job in controlling situation, due to the fact the airplane did not leave until 1am and everything was closed at the airport, they put out snacks and drinks for everyone who needed something and decided to give out future travel vouchers to make up for the delay. Even though I would have preferred not having a delay, it was a nice touch on their behalf. Overall very happy with their service. Keep up the good work."
"""get what you pay for""","On Southwest, you get what you pay for. This time, however, I got better than I expected. The itinerary had a departure from San Juan at 5:40 am with a stop in Orlando and a transfer in Denver. The flight ultimately let us off at San Francisco at 1:00 pm, making the entire trip 13 hours. Fortunately, Southwest featured free DirecTV on an electronic device and movie rentals for $5.00 each, covering entertainment for the first two flights. The DEN-SFO leg was an older plane, so there was no entertainment option. There were no full meals, but the flight attendants had a stash of snacks and refreshments for all three flights. Seat comfort was questionable and there was only one bathroom, but that's the expectation for the airline that sells tickets $400 cheaper than any other. Ultimately, I was quite impressed by the flexibility and price of the flight, and I recommend Southwest to an budget traveler."
"""take 2 bags for no charge""","Dallas to San Diego. I am a college student and love that I can take 2 bags underneath for no charge. Sometimes, I fly the really early or late flights, and it is nice to know that I can still get a small snack without charge. This Christmas my dad got suddenly sick and was hospitalized. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I would not be penalized for changing my flight date so I could be with my family. I was surprised that all I had to do was pay the remaider if the flight I changed to was more expensive or I would receive a credit if it was cheaper. Thank you Southwest for taking some of the stress off during this time."
"""lose sight of what made them""","Ontario to Sacramento. This is more of a review on the so called rapid ""reward"" program of Southwest. I fly routinely from Southern California to Sacramento and had built up points to qualify for the ""A"" list of the reward system. I knew I was going to be a little short on the required points but I also had a flight scheduled for the 30th December. I ended up purchasing the tier qualifying points and knew I had the points coming from the flight that was scheduled on the 30th which would have put me way over the needed points. So when I inquired about the status I was told that the flight on the 30th December did not count for 2015 but rather for 2016. When I asked for an explanation I was told something that did not make sense and questioned the person about this that all of a sudden the explanation changed, I then asked for a refund of the tier points that I had purchased as was told ""Sorry but you should have known those were non-refundable? When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told this person who refused to give me his name was the Executive Director of customer relations. He then stated, ""Sorry but there is nothing that he can do"". He didn't even try to make it right but rather tried to come up with different excuses. Also he knew very little about the policies as I was placed on hold several times while he consulted with another co-worker. This is what happens when a company loses sight of what made them what they are - and that is the Customer."
"""excellent customer service""","I get terribly motion sick so I have chosen to drive for years. This trip from Charlotte to New Orleans via Houston driving was not an option. I was anxious that I would be sick and miserable the whole flight. Thankfully I was not and the Southwest Airlines crew were friendly and funny. On both legs of the flight we were delayed a bit due to bad weather but the connecting flight waited for the 40 or so passengers to arrive. Unfortunately due to the flight delay our baggage wasn't transferred in time so once we arrived in New Orleans we had to go to the desk and submit a baggage ticket. The women at the desk were patient even though I was about to lose my mind! They located our luggage on the next flight and promptly brought it our hotel and they gave us an airport meal voucher and 2 drink vouchers even though we decided not to wait. The trip back home was just a pleasant and our luggage arrived with us. I will be flying again in 2 weeks and again over the summer on Southwest. I like the reasonable fares and the free baggage but the excellent customer service shown by Southwest will keep me a loyal customer. Customer service is free but it makes all the difference."
"""best to worst""","Southwest Airlines used to be a top notch economy airline. Friendly people, on time, and reasonable. Today? Surly people, prices are not anything special, and they must have one of the worst on time ratios ever. Lots of the planes are dated and don't even have wireless. Out of my last 23 flights, 4 have been on time. What a shame. Best to worst in a few years."
"""never fly them again""","Pittsburgh to Jacksonville. Southwest Airlines is the least empathetic airline on which I ever flown. They will tell you that your flight is cancelled and not offer any accommodation. I have spent over 400$ in the past 6 months in rental car fees due to having to drive to my destination due to flight cancellations. They will not reimburse you for time and money spent trying to get to your destination (rental cars, hotels, etc) if weather related. You better think twice if you want to be at your destination on the days/times you have chose to fly out/arrive. I was a huge supporter of Southwest, but now I can say I will never fly with them again."
"""every trip delayed""","I am stranded in Tampa going on six hours, unable to get to Atlanta on this horrible airline. Every half hour Southwest Airlines change the estimate on when we can go, without telling the truth about what's wrong, stringing passengers along until the inevitable cancellation and overnight stay on the airport floor. I keep making the same mistake in booking flights with this airline-every trip this year has been delayed without cause to the point where it isn't safe to travel with Southwest if you need to arrive on time. Their planes are dirty, particularly the restrooms. I have learned to make sure I won't have to use them and after today's disgusting service I will now avoid the whole airline. Don't book unless you don't mind being hours late each time."
"""terrible customer service""","Our Southwest Airlines flight from Chicago Midway to Jacksonville, FL on 28 December was cancelled due to weather and we couldn't be rebooked until 1 January. So we were stuck in Chicago for 4 days and no luggage. Southwest refused to take our luggage off the plane, and instead flew it to Jacksonville. No explanation for this, and calls to baggage management at Midway and Jacksonville were never answered or returned. No reimbursement. Absolutely terrible customer service."
"""an error in judgement""","This flight was set to depart about 9:20pm on Dec 28, from Orlando to Birmingham, the first delay was to 10:15 pm and came out about 6:05pm. So they knew they had a problem at 6pm. It appears the problem originated due to the St Louis flight not being able to come into Chicago due to sleet and severe weather, hence the Chicago to Nashville leg of the flight was also delayed. The flight we were scheduled for was to come in from Nashville. Southwest is a point to point airline as I was told by customer service today, (after holding for 90 minutes) which means if a previous leg is delayed or canceled there is no plane to pick you up. So know where your plane is coming from and check its flight status. We were told another plane was being routed from Dallas to Nashville to pick up passengers and come to Orlando to be our plane from Orlando to Birmingham. The delay was again changed from 10:15 to 11:55 then to 12:55 am. A plane did arrive at 12:20 and we were told it was our flight. Only to be told at 12:50 am that the pilot has too many hours and cant fly you to Birmingham after all, so we are now at 12:50 am going to officially cancel the 9:20 pm Flight and we cant get you on another flight till 9:20 pm the next day. My concern in calling customer service was to ask that the process be reviewed in regard to how this flight delay then cancelation was handled as obviously a mistake was made in telling the passengers they had a plane coming with a delayed departure time set for 12:55 am and yet no one in command for Southwest was checking flight hours for the pilots to realize there was no way this flight was leaving Orlando. The customer service rep said she could only report my concerns to management but I did not have the right to ask for an explanation or any admission they had made an error in judgement on when the flight should have been canceled. I just wanted to know they would look into it and determine a better method to communicate flights, delays and pilot and crew travel restrictions so that this type of very avoidable error doesnt happen agsain. Southwest cannot control the weather and they will continue to be a point to point airline operation but get some people who can do math to determine flight hours limitations for pilots and crews in these situations so after a 4.5 hour delay you are not told the flight now has to cancel because of pilot has to many hours to fly. If you are making these types of errors what else is happening behind the scenes? Also I would just like an email from management that they are looking into this for enhancement or correction and wa stold no way your getting any admission from us about why this happened. Does not make me want to continue my long tenure with Southwest."
"""has become a joke""","St Louis to Chicago. The customer service continues to decline every time I fly! In the plast year I have flown at least 15 times and I get more frustrated and disappointed each time. They can't even get their automated phone service for checking flight status right or update their website in a timely manner. When a flight is cancelled it shouldn't take over 30 minutes for this stuff to be updated! Customers are trying to double check before they leave for the airport. Then when talking to a customer service representative they are rude and tell you it's out of their control when things are updated. So what your telling your customers is please pay to fly with us blindly and good luck! Southwest has become a joke!"
"""not a good experience""","Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale. Not a good experience, the flight was delayed, pushed from 8pm to midnight. When they boarded the flight they then left us sitting on the plane waiting for a pilot to come in from Denver to fly us south. The experience was very poor and mismanaged. This is the second time in a row this has happened to me with this airline, never again - I will give my money to another airline."
"""legroom was pretty acceptable""","My trip from Phoenix to Chicago this summer aboard Southwest was a 9/10 overall. As soon as we arrived at the airport, we used the check-in next to the parking garage. It was efficient and saved lots of time. At our gate, boarding was in groups. We were in B. We boarded with no trouble. Our plane was a 737-800, with the split scimitar winglets. I loved the plane, and it offered a smooth as can be ride. Beverage service was provided with small cups, but enough to quench my thirst. As usual, Southwest provided peanuts and pretzels. The last time I flew (2013) I was provided 2 bags of pretzels, but this flight I was given crackers and peanuts. The legroom on board was pretty acceptable, normal for a Southwest flight. The landing was the worst part, though. We had to go around to make way for a smaller plane, and as soon as we landed, it was the bumpiest I had experienced. Not that all airplane landings are smooth, but this one wasn't. The de-boarding process was quick. Due to the small traffic and flow of flights, Southwest's baggage claim was also a quick and easy experience."
"""quite convenient""","Flew Southwest Airlines from El Paso to Los Angeles. Not the cheapest choice at all, but quite convenient for travellers departing from an area with poor air connectivity like El Paso. Rapid, efficient check-in, timely departures, fairly organised boarding, funny crew (this should have a limit, though). Wifi is not free but at least you can track your flight using their basic free signal and browse their website. Baggage delivery took a while at LAX, but came really fast in El Paso."
"""nothing but compliments""","Wonderful airline! I booked our trip with Southwest Airtlines, and it was quick and easy! I booked our hotel with Southwest also. The boarding process was efficient, and the flight attendents were wonderful. The complimentary beverages and snacks were appreciated, and One Free Bag was great. I have nothing but compliments about Southwest!"
"""be avoiding Southwest""","I was able to pre board onto my Southwest Airlines plane. I'm a tall guy so I headed for the emergency row. I get seated and the flight attendant angrily asks me to move, as a pre boarder I'm not allowed to sit in the emergency row. Confused, I obliged. Calm until the guy who walked in directly after me claims the extra leg room for himself. Why me specifically am I not allowed to sit there? Offended as all hell, I'll be avoiding Southwest for future flights."
"""it is no longer fun""","I have flown on SW since 1971! It used to be fun when I was a teenager. It is no longer fun. Southwest Airlines has always had open seating. In 1981, before they had Early Bird check in, I flew to Tampa to visit my parents with my 3 year old. There were NO adjoining seats. The only way I got a person to move was to say they would have to take care of my daughter. I quit flying SW! I started back when they started Early Bird. I am quitting SW again. It is truly a cattle car. Like riding the bus in the 60-70's. Both flights I was 49 with paying extra. I got the last aisle seat on that plane. Early bird does not help if you have a continuing flight which most Southwest Airlines flights are. Also too bare bones. Plane was freezing. No blankets. People were rude while waiting for the bathroom. Said don't stand here. Like where are you going to stand? It is not the airline I knew in the 70's. Even with 2 bags free it is not worth it and sometimes Southwest Airlines is more $$$. Apparently I was dozing on both flights and received no snacks or drinks."
"""very happy with Southwest Airlines""","Very happy with Southwest Airlines flight from Salt Lake City to LAX. My daughter had a delayed flight, and her next flight was going international. Without hesitation the agent at the airport got her on the next flight out so that she would not miss her international flight."
"""is always on time""","We had a wonderful flight from Phoenix to Milwaukee. Left on time and arrived 10 minutes early. For us, Southwest is always on time. The flight attendants were very entertaining and worked with precision. This was a nonstop to MKE. Here is the negative, my wife and I paid the $12.50 each for Early Check-in and got positions A-36/37. It didn't mean much. Unfortunately, when they pre-boarded the plane, 33 people got on. About 10 to 12 wheelchairs and their entourage including a puny ""service"" dog. Even the gate agent rolled her eyes at the numbers. So, to sit together on the aisle, we were back in row 19. I can understand wheelchairs pre-boarding. Perhaps people in the entourage who pre-board should have to pay $12.50 each as well."
"""recommend to friends and family""","Husband and I flew Southwest Airlines for our 25 Wedding Anniversary Trip from Atlanta, Georgia to Los Angeles, California round-trip November 13, 2015 with return November 22, 2015. Both legs of the trip were wonderful. We did upgrade to the Early Bird Check-in and that was only $12.50 more each way per person. We got an A boarding position and had our pick of seats upon entering the aircraft. Both planes were on time and actually got us to our destinations earlier than scheduled. Flight attendance were nice and efficient and pilot was well spoken and friendly when he spoke to the plane about weather, arrival times and such. Seats were very tight, but that was to be expected. Both my husband and I took aisle seats and that makes for easier exiting to bathrooms and such. When we found that the cabin was a little too warm they fixed it right away making the temperature much more agreeable. Snacks were good and coffee was very good! No charge for those on Southwest. Being able to check two bags for no-charge was also nice. I will fly Southwest again and would recommend it to friends and family. Not the big open spaces that you get on some of the more expensive carriers, but a nice, low-key flight that gets you to where you want to go without cleaning out your wallet."
"""I would not push with the crowd""","No seat assignment did not work leaving Punta Cana. Passengers ignored the number calls for the seat assignments and basically rushed the plane. I thought a riot was about to start. I paid for the early seating and I was the last person on the plane because I would not push with the crowd. As I entered the plane last I told the flight attendant I was to be the 76th passenger to board and instead I was the last which separated me and my husband (on our anniversary) and her only comment was ""I wonder how that happened?"" I showed up 3 hours in advance to the airport and 6 other people showed up after we started boarding the bus ride to the tarmac and somehow they ended up ahead of me and seated together! This was my first Southwest Airlines flight and my last as they are instigating riots with this type of boarding."
"""service was great""","Was headed back home from the holidays. Southwest Airlines flight attendants on flight 1857 from Baltimore to Nassau on December 1st were awesome. I don't like flying but one particular lady stood out and made the entire flight unforgettable. Their service was great and a wonderful team. It was my first flight with this airline it sure won't be the last. Excellent service."
"""no seat assignment is ridiculous""","Ft Lauderdale to Minneapolis with Southwest Airlines. First of all the no seat assignment thing is ridiculous, as if traveling doesn't come with enough chores as it is both on the leaving and returning flights my wife is sitting there waiting to get as far up the seating queue as possible. Not that it mattered since the return flight was delayed past the time our connecting flight flew out. They ended up putting us up in a Holiday Inn but we had to pay for a cab back to the airport since the flight we were booked on was too early for shuttle service. Then we got here and baggage check service is closed until 45 minutes before the flight and we're way at the back of the seating queue."
"""now I am a big fan""","Southwest Airlines flight 2932, from Denver to Chicago Midway. Although a totally full end of Thanksgiving weekend (Sunday PM} flight, all went very smoothly. Professional and courteous airport and cabin staff handle all with aplomb. Southwest Airlines is efficient, and at a good price point. I'm new to Southwest, and now I am a big fan!"
"""my highest recommendation""","Flew MDW - DEN #6151 on Thanksgiving morning, an A seat near rear, flight almost totally full (except for B seat adjacent me!). Despite the crowd and a 1 hour weather delay, all went smoothly; many toddlers, several folks in wheelchairs, and even a pet dog, all handled with dispatch. Pleasant and professional cabin staff. My first time with Southwest Airlines and I aim to use them again! My main ""criteria"" with most everything is ""I shouldn't have to 'notice' anything"", meaning all should work as planned, no drama, no hassle. WN met and exceeded my ""criteria scale rating"" in this regard, so my highest recommendation."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","After booking an 8am flight from LaGuardia to Denver for the day before Thanksgiving, I woke up 4 hours after my alarm at 9am. I thought my Thanksgiving travel plans were destroyed but I hopped in a cab and Southwest put me on the next flight at 10.30 through Atlanta without any trouble or extra fees. In Atlanta, Southwest is on their game. The flight is on time, the gate is lively with a charismatic host cracking jokes, and they're giving out free cookies."
"""unbelievable is all I can say""","Arrived at airport in a timely manner and was told that we were moved up on standby by list. Got told I was number one for 945 flight, didn't make the flight however my better half did. Was put on the 1030 standby list, still number 1 on list, and the agent sends three people ahead of me that were on vacation and worked for Southwest. Unbelievable is all I can say. 1230 flight she puts a guy ahead of me that said he would pay extra."
"""keeps saying unavailable or sold out""","First of all let me say that I have been flying for years and Southwest is my absolute favorite airlines. I don't know what happened this year but I always fly to Fort Lauderdale, Florida every April. Now when I am ready to book a flight the prices are horrendous. $800 to $900 to fly to Florida from Hartford. It is unbelievable. The times are terrible. I can't imagine what happened to this wonderful airline. There are hardly any flights. Keeps saying unavailable or sold out. I went on the web site exactly 1 minute after they opened their site and that is what it said, sold out, that is impossible. Usually their flights are $300 to $400 for that trip, so what happened? Usually my rating would be 10 but not right now."
"""a laid back attitude""","Flying out of Las Vegas is often a depressing experience. The airport can be full gamblers who lost, or people sad to see their vacations end. The security line and line for the ticket counters can be infinite. On my flight, there was a gate change about 20 minutes before our flight was to board. This wasn't announced until shortly after we were supposed to board. There was some additional delay in boarding and our flight left about 30 minutes late. On Southwest, there are no assigned seats. I elected for $12 for the advanced check in option, and was assigned slot B5 (which is equivalent to the 65th person to board the aircraft). I had no problem finding a seat I liked, window seat near the front of the plane. There was wifi with about 20 live TV channels available on your own device. One thing I like about Southwest is they do not take themselves that seriously. Humor and a laid back attitude is common among ground staff and flight crew. The crew on my flight were attentive and friendly. Southwest also does not charge a bag or change fee. I booked the lowest fare and my fare went down a few times. I was simply able to change my flight to the current fare and a credit is now in my account to use towards future flights. I do not get my money back per say, but I do not lose it either. Try that with any other airline these days. And they still serve snacks."
"""well done Southwest""","Reno to Las Vegas return. This route with Southwest Airlines is always easy and reasonably on time. 10 minute late departure which was well posted and the time was made up in the air. Ground staff pleasant and helpful. Cabin crew friendly and flight only 75% full so nice to have some extra room. Was raining and snowing on departure and once up in the air we were above the clouds and in the sun. Very little turbulence. Coming home was a full flight, but on time. Everyone was in a good mood. Beautiful night time takeoff over the lights of Vegas and before you knew it we were descending into Reno. Well done Southwest. Keep it up."
"""worst company I've flown""","Southwest Airlines is the worst airline I've ever seen. You don't have a seat assignment and are herded in like cattle. Forget it if you're traveling with someone, as there is no chance you'll get to sit by them and no chance anyone will try and accommodate two people together. Southwest Airlines is up there with Spirit Airlines as the worst company I've ever flown and I will never book a ticket with them again"
"""always delay the flights""","I traveled on October 29th evening, The flight was changed frequently I remember its 5 times and from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM, Before I noticed the flight change I already traveled to airport and waited for 5 hours in the airport. I seriously don't understand why Southwest Airlines will always delay the flights. I don't understand I waited for 5 hours and even my return flight from Atlanta to Austin was delayed for 3 hours. Everytime when I traveled it will delay for sure. I wont go for Southwest Airlines from next time."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","New Orleans to Denver. Great value and I love not having to pay extra just to select a seat or to bring a carry-on bag. The Southwest Airlines attendants are friendly. Everything from check-in to boarding to baggage pick up is easy."
"""bag is currently in limbo""","I was forced to check my bag leaving California even though I took it on my Southwest Airlines flight to California, they tell me to put it outside the door someone will check it. So that's what I do, the flight attendant informed me someone has taken my bag down below. When I land in Columbus it is lost in Vegas. They tell me it is on a certain flight but when that flight landed nowhere to be found again and the baggage claim said that there is no way for whoever informed me of which flight it was on, or to know it was actually on that flight. My bag is currently in limbo and not a single person knows where it is at and all they can tell me is sorry, nothing we can do about it. What a joke this airline is."
"""upset and disappointed""","This was the worst experience I had with Southwest Airlines. I booked a 2 way trip for a family trip, Austin to Atlanta. The flight was delayed several times, I had booked my hotel and tickets for other shows, because of the delay of the flight I couldn't go to any place on time. My plan was completely spoiled, my vacation was terrible because of Southwest. During the return also I had the same issue, the flight was delayed again. I generally use Southwest for all my travels and this was not the first time, I have faced this issue, every time the flight gets delayed. I am very upset and disappointed."
"""will surf for alternatives""","This is one among my most disappointing review I’ve shared. All over the airport was reviewing publicity posters which says “Transfarency” by Southwest Airlines which I’m aren’t sure how would that define without providing a minimal customer gratification, which not everyone thinks that money might be the only criteria to check. I’ve been associated with Southwest since long time, but haven’t felt this way where I had to lost valuable time with repeated change/delay in time. Further I was nowhere in a choice but had to wait for hours and hours. At time there were situation with my company where I had backed Southwest for its remarkable service in-spite of contradicting opinions all over. I made all my personal and business trips through this airline but eventually had end up in a situation of bizarre. Expected arrival of journey was 9 p.m and travel home on a emergency, and could't make it because of an undefined delay, In fact I had to drive 9 hrs by road to reach on time, and on return again had faced delay, however I understand weather issues. Nevertheless, such and incident will definitely leave an impression to surf for alternatives."
"""horrible, unethical, airline""","So stressful! We went online to get boarding passes and paid extra for early boarding. When it came time to board, there were only four people behind us. Not exactly sure what we paid for. We weren't the only ones that happened to (my partner's seat mates were complaining of it too, mind you they got on early enough to sit together, we didnt). If you don't board early you're stuck with middle seats and grumpy people who don't want you to sit there. One lady in first row piled snacks and drinks in seat beside her. She got away with it. People weren't sure if she was saving the seat. She wasn't. Great airline for rude selfish people, but if you're timid or shy, any other airline will do. I will pay anything extra on any other airline rather than go through that again. Horrible, unethical, airline."
"""sensitive to my needs""","I am a customer of size and have flown SW twice in 4 months to Denver. Both times my flight has been pleasant, and attendants sensitive to my needs. I will continue to fly SW, especially since their fares are more than reasonable"
"""another airline with lousy service""","Los Angeles to Baltimore Washington. Be warned about Southwest Airlines Early Bird check in feature. It has failed to work for me several times now. Your are required to pay an advance fee, which is supposed to get you a check in spot prior to the 24 hour advance check in. Instead, when checking in after the 24 hour time frame, you are assigned the next boarding place, which by then is far back in line. Better to just skip the fee and log in exactly 24 hours ahead, which we all know is a real pain. And if you try to get customer service to respond, be prepared for a 20 min hold on the phone, followed by a representative who could not care less. Southwest is fast succumbing to the fee-for-everything model, which in addition to their escalating prices, makes them just another airline with lousy service. I've been planning a switch for a time, now feels right."
"""Thank you Southwest""","I misplaced my passport on a Southwest Airlines flight from Las Vegas last week. I had not even realized it was missing until I received a call from a supervisor. She put me in touch with another staff member who made sure they sent overnight by courier to my Hotel. This allowed me to go home to Canada. Thank you Southwest."
"""great customer service""","My grandchildren flew to NY to see us (ages 8 and 12). Experienced flyers, but still children. On flight out, the steward on their flight went out of their way to walk the two to their next gate (Baltimore) even though they did not need to. Great customer service! But to top that, when getting ready to return home, the little one was sick the morning of the flight. We were not sure if he would be able to fly. So we called (knowing that we would be charged to change their flight, and probably a lot) to change departure date and time. When explaining why I was calling, I was told I could change the flight and pay the difference. I decided to give the little one some time and the decide. Needless to say, time made no difference. I called back and talked to a Supervisor who answered the call. She quickly told me due to a child's sickness, we could change at no cost. We checked flights and changed to two days later. Thanks Southwest - another example of great customer service. We travel a lot and will always use Southwest when possible."
"""I will avoid Southwest""","The flight itself was average but they did accomodate our group and we all sat in the back together. I'm currently on my way back to San diego and so far, not a great experience with the check in people telling my group 5 different things and thoroughly confusing everyone. Then boarding, we were all separated and no attendees to assist in any way. First flight: great attendees, bad luggage handling. Second flight: bad check in, attendees. Overall, I will avoid Southwest when possible."
"""last flights been nightmares""","We have used Southwest Airlines for years, flying frequently. It was,at one time, a great airline. Our last five flights have been nightmares, basically delays causing missed connections and inept, impolite customer service on the ground in Kansas City, Houston, and New York. What has happened to Southwest Airlines? Now, instead of looking for flights on Southwest, I look for ways to avoid this airline."
"""seems to be in serious decline""","Southwest Airlines system apparently hacked on 10/11/15 forcing use of paper carbon boarding passes for entire family. Subsequently, my son who was returning to college the following week was unable to check in for boarding pass since they believed he had not flown the previous week. They wanted $200 more than was quoted on their website during ticketing to get on. My wife spent over 2 hours, including 45 min with a supervisor to no effect. Their response was to call customer relations on Monday morning which is 24 hours after the necessary flight. The bottom line is do not trust or rely on the Southwest Airlines website - it clearly is not accurate and do not expect anyone at Southwest to rectify a situation caused by their incompetence. We have used Southwest Airlines 15-30 times per year for the last 8 years. It appears we will have to return to Delta which offers the same flight for us and they appear to be improving compared to Southwest Airlines which seems to be in serious decline."
"""a horrible experience""","Well after spending 5+ hours in line and there was no end in sight , with swollen legs, I could not stand any longer. Southwest Airlines treated those who missed their early flight with no regard. They started taking people who had later flights and processing them thru and kept us waiting and waiting and waiting. After 5 hours one Southwest Airlines gentlemen walking thru told us we would be on standby with little chance of getting a flight. We we told to come back on Tursday, Southwest Airlines gave little regard and no information to its passengers during this entire process. I am shocked that they did not have management walking and checking with people and seeing to their needs. Such a horrible experience."
"""will be shopping other airlines""","We were very frequent Southwest Airlines business flyers of what was the best airline in the sky. Never leaving late, fun attentive service and never leaving late (did I mention that). Our last 5 flights over the last 3 months had 1 on time and the others between 1 and 3 hours late. This has been getting worse for the last 2 years and now so prevalent we will be shopping other airlines. No more fun, funny staff. They're not bad, just like the rest of the airlines. But not knowing when the plane will get to the destination just doesn't cut it. Lateness and cancellations galore. On the plus side, they still have the best luggage and change policy but it's now being trumped by the deficits. Often their prices range from the best to the worst on scheduled routes. You can't just depend on value."
"""really great low cost airline""","Southwest Airlines are a really great low cost airline. Flew Las Vegas to Tampa non stop, great new plane, informative and friendly staff, bags fly free and complimentary snack and soft drinks while on board. Easyjet and Ryanair here in the UK could take another leaf out of their book."
"""Thank you Southwest""","My family recently spent four weeks on vacation in the USA. We booked five domestic flights with Southwest (all direct to minimise loss of luggage and missed connections) and had no problems. From booking, to check-in, boarding, in-flight cabin service to collection of luggage we had friendly staff. The seating system took a little getting used to, but there has to be a concession to'cheap flights and this was it. So, Thank you Southwest for making our holiday run smoothly."
"""now waiting on delayed flight ""","We are at Dallas Love Field right now waiting on a flight that Southwest Airlines delayed because it was not full, and thus not profitable enough for management (flight 29). So we will miss our connecting flight to Harlingen from Houston. SWA says they have ""protected"" us by putting us on the 6:00PM flight instead. Then, the gate agent said that they ""tried to put us an an earlier flight but we must have not checked in early enough."" Not true. We were here before the recommended check in time. They are dishonest. Never fly SWA."
"""fun sense of professionalism""","Ft Lauderdale to Los Angeles via Atlanta with Southwest Airlines. Cross-country flights are always hard. But, I'd like to extend my appreciation to the Southwest flight crew who, with their freewheeling, fun sense of professionalism, managed to dissipate the stress I was feeling caused by the TSA. The flights are almost always full, and the seats are much smaller than at Delta, but the people at Southwest are really great. I'll certainly book again with Southwest."
"""could have changed flight for free""","Not only did I have to pay over 150 dollars to reschedule my Southwest Airlines flight for 4 hours later, which was the flight I originally wanted. I was told that if I had just shown up late to the airport they could have changed my flight for free. Apparently being nice and calling doesn't pay off. I ended up having to pay almost the original price of the round trip ticket again to get home. They informed me there was nothing they could do even though the whole thing was their fault. Once on the flight my row was skipped over for drinks and snacks. That is understandable, it happens. However, I paid for wifi that never worked."
"""upset at the way we were treated""","We arrived at Ontario Airport approximately 1 hour before the Southwest Airlines flight was due to depart. Our flight was supposed to depart at 1020 hours with a layover in Sacramento and then landing in Portland, Oregon at 1345 hours. At 0950 hours there was an announcement that the flight would be delayed until 1130 hours. This meant that we would not make it to Sacramento on time for our layover in Portland. We went to the Southwest counter and we were told that the only flight we could get on would mean we would have a four hour layover in San Jose and we wouldn't land in Portland until 1915 hours. I explained to the lady that we needed an earlier flight because we were flying to Portland for a family event that started at 1900 hours. She then told me that there was a flight that landed in Portland at 1805 hours, but that was the earliest. So, we reluctantly took that flight. My Fiancee asked about our luggage. She said that our luggage would be on a direct flight and would land in Portland at 1400 hours. I asked her since the luggage was getting there before us where we would pick it up. She said ""Baggage claim"". I understand where baggage is picked up, I'm not an idiot. I just thought since luggage was getting there sooner we would pick it up in a specific area at baggage claim. She handed me the tickets and told me that was it. I had overheard another customer received vouchers so I asked her if we would receive any vouchers for our trouble. She explained that we did not qualify for any vouchers because our flight landed before 1900 hours. We walked away from that counter upset, and promising we would never fly Southwest Airlines again. Deciding that we needed to do something about the lack of customer service, we got back in line to talk to someone else. When we eventually got to the front of the line we spoke to an agent. He explained to us that the flight we had was the earliest he could find for us. My fiancée then explained that we had not received a voucher or anything for our inconvenience. He then gave us two $200 vouchers for future use. We were still upset, but felt a little better about receiving the vouchers. While we were standing near the counter deciding where to go sit down, we overheard another gentleman being very loud and rude to one of the ladies behind the counter. He was on the same flight as us and was upset about not landing in Portland until late at night. Not only did he get on the same flight as we did, but he also received two $200 vouchers and face value for his ticket. I am sure that delays happen often do to inclement weather or maintenance problems and I understand that those problems are out of Southwest Airlines control. It is just very upsetting that someone that was rude and loud received more for his inconvenience than we did. Did we receive less because we were nice? Getting something for a flight being delayed shouldn't depend on the volume of our voice or the rudeness in our tone. This should be about what Southwest Airlines can do to keep customers and what they can do to apologize for missed family events. I am not only upset at the way we were treated, but also the fact that we received almost nothing for the extra seven hours we had to spend at the airport."
"""we keep coming back to Southwest""","I commend Southwest Airlines on the exceptional customer service I experienced today. Southwest Airlines actually contacted me by phone regarding an upcoming trip in January from San Juan to Canton /Akron. The flight was moved from the early afternoon to 6:45 am. That would present little issue except that we are arriving in to San Juan on a cruise ship at 8:00 am. and could not make the flight. The representative checked and there were no flights out to CAK the next two days and asked if we could switch airports. We advised that we lived near the CLE airport and they were more than happy to switch for us as long as we were willing to leave from one airport and arrive back at the other. A day later, after discussions with our traveling companions, we decided that it would make more logistical sense to leave from the same airport. I called Customer Service and they could not have made it easier for me and were more than willing to accommodate our request. Once again, this kind of service is the reason we keep coming back to Southwest Airlines."
"""the Southwest experience was average""","For the most part, the experience was average. Except, there were a few specific instances in which I was extremely frustrated. 1) There was a delay in our flight (this happens), so we landed as soon as our connecting flight was finishing boarding. We stepped off the first plane (from Las Vegas to Austin), ran to the next gate for the next flight (Austin to DC), and as we arrived they were saying our names over the loudspeaker. We got on the flight and the plane was completely full except for our seats which was fine, however the flight attendants were not very kind, and we all felt that we were blamed for being late. However we have zero control in the matter of the other plane making it to the airport in time for the connecting flight. That was very unsettling, and embarrassing, as this was taking place in front of other passengers. 2) I attempted to connect to the WiFi via Southwest for their entertainment. This is free (yet limited) and there was no warning about that. The connection was also poor, so I decided to spend the $8 on the full-access WiFi. It took me over an hour to connect to this, and I needed certain applications on my phone to watch certain shows which I could set-up until after the flight. Again, there was no warning prior to purchasing that additional applications would be needed. Additionally, the connection was poor and I had to constantly refresh (even after paying), which was extremely frustrating. Generally, very limited legroom, and too long of a time getting snacks/refreshments, but I guess you get what you pay for."
"""Professional, courteous and friendly service""","We had a great flying experience with Southwest Airlines. Professional, courteous and friendly service of crew. 2 free checked bags and the 2 Free carry ons. This last trip from Nashville to our connecting flight in Vegas to Salt Lake was exceptional. Staff provided caring and friendly service, went out of their way to make sure all passengers were well taken care!"
"""saved my entire trip""","I missed my Southwest Airlines flight from JAX to CLE because I left my wallet at home. They put me on the next flight in the morning at no extra charge. The flight attendants were very professional and courteous, and some very funny. The drinks are reasonably priced also. When I got to Cleveland, I got all the way to the baggage return, picked up my bag, waited outside for 10 minutes for my ride, and then realized I didn't have my wallet. I of course go racing back inside and find the first Southwest Airlines employee I can, because I am well beyond TSA checkpoints and can't get back to the gate. They immediately ask on the radio if they have a wallet and the radio comes over saying yes they have it asking what my last name is. They saved my entire trip."
"""the best in this business""","I've flown Southwest Airlines for the past 10 years. I just returned from San Antonio, TX. An excellent flight going and coming, Both pilots were great. Flight# 3147 from San Antonio and flight attendants were top shelf employees, the best in this business - helpful, attentive and knowledgeable. Not too busy to look customers in the eye or shake hands with people. We really had a great trip and the whole process was enhanced because of these people."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I will never fly Southwest again. If you have a flight that connects and leaves after 2pm you will more likely than not miss the connecting flight and be stranded overnight. They offer no assistance in that event regardless of if it was their fault or not and they will never put you on another airline. They offer frequent flights between LAX and SF Bay Area making it popular with business travelers. The problem is that they routinely cancel flights 20 minutes before departure because the flight is less than half full and then send you on a later flight 2 or 3 hours later making it impossible to schedule and attend meetings the same day. Southwest went from the very best no frills airline 10 years ago to one of the top 10 worst now. I wouldn't use any airline now unless they are a direct flight. For LAX to SF Area use Jet Blue, Virgin America or Alaska Airlines, not Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I see a lot of negative reviews and honestly in the 19 years I have flown with this airline I have had nothing but good things happen to me. I had to make an international flight in Seattle and I had no trouble at all. The reason why they have open seating is to speed up the boarding process. And yes they do pack a lot of people into planes because they do such a good job! The attendants are really wonderful about 95% of the time. I have had some okay attendants but we all have our bad days."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Will never fly this airline again. First of all their scheduling is poor. I got a text every 3 to five minutes with multiple changes in departure time. Times moving forward and back ranging 2 hrs back to 30 min delay. The plane boarded 3 times before they actually departed. The flight itself was 20 min longer than it was supposed to be. The connecting flight departed 10 min before we landed. They tell me that this is common and they don't compensate for this situation. I will pay for extra bags and assigned seating, because I will fly with an airline that care about their customers instead of putting on a front with fancy advertising. Completely unprofessional."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","What a rotten standby policy. If Southwest has openings on flights and you want to go earlier than your scheduled flight they make you pay extra to ""reschedule"" your flight because technically standby is only available to those who have missed a flight! The seat is empty, you've paid for a ticket for a seat on a later flight but Southwest is unwilling to accommodate you."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","The flight from Charlotte was ok, except the staff had no wings for my two daughters who were flying for the first time, and the multiple delays. There were so many problems with the return flight we had to cancel and fly back with Delta Air Lines. Southwest Airlines ground staff were not empathetic at all to the situation of our flight being canceled twice."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We did a round trip flight to Milwaukee from Boise. We experienced a 7 hour delay in Boise and had to stay in Vegas. They offered no help with lodging or discounted flights etc. Now on the return trip once again we have a 3 hour delay out of Denver. They are supposedly delaying our flight to accommodate passengers on a second incoming flight to Denver. I will never fly Southwest again. Pay 25 bucks a bag and go with another airline - they dropped the ball on our trip."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","First time traveling with Southwest to PUJ from IAD. On August 15, 2015 I traveled from PUJ to MDW. Before departing the airplane, the pilot informed passengers that all flights to Washington were cancelled and to proceed to ticketing. So once I cleared customs, I went upstairs to the ticketing counter and after spending almost an hour in line, I was told my flight to IAD had been cleared. It was around 4:15pm. So they took my baggage and told me to proceed to the gate. I had to go through security again. After spending over 3 hours at the gate, I was informed again the flight had been cancelled. Customer Service said that Southwest had only two flights to IAD on 8/16 and the flights were full and they could get me on a flight on Tuesday. I understand the issue with air traffic control, however FAA stated computers were back in service at 4 pm on 8/15. Southwest only had three to four flights to IAD and my flight was at 8:55 pm. So with only four flights, Southwest could not get the later flights to IAD out? I'm stuck in an airport on standby but the only thing Southwest say is sorry, it wasn't our fault. Southwest needs to do a better job with its flights and with IAD being a major airport, more flights to and from are needed. Southwest also need to branch out to ORD and contract with other airlines to assist in situations like this. Having customers wait for three days to catch another flight without any form of compensation is unacceptable. Offering free baggages and open seating will not keep customers."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have been flying with Southwest Airlines for the past 3 months between LAS to BUR, this is the first time my flight got delayed because of weather conditions in Las Vegas on Aug 13, the 5.05 flight. Staff have been friendly and communicating well on delays, after we boarded the flight it was delayed again for 1 hour. While we were waiting on a part I requested a glass of water, the flight attendant refused to give water even though I mentioned I needed to take my medication. Sorry Southwest this will be my last flight."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Our party of 5 was early to arrive at the airport for check in. Our boarding passes indicated Section C. When boarding they call people with 'A', 'B', and 'C'. We were the only 'c's. When entering the plane, we were all looking for seats 29-33. It didn't take long to figure out these seats/rows did not exist. Over the loud speaker it was announced that they were ready to take of and 'find a seat'. If you see any empty one 'take it'. They must board you by alphabet since we had the initial 'W"" as our last names. This was the same as our flight back, however we had 2 people behind us, so we were one of the last 7 passengers to board. None of us sat together on either flight. If you want to sit together you have to pay an extra $40 per person, for an assigned seat."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flightas are always delayed hours and are filthy. Just look at the window sills on every flight compared to every other airline. Black dirt rings and trash in the seat back accompany the dirty seats. If you try to get an earlier flight they want to charge a fee equal to the original ticket cost, and will not let you use you frequent flyer miles to switch flights. Southwest Airlines is a horrible airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I wanted to say Thank you and give super kudos to an employee who worked at the Southwest ticket counter in Atlanta. I never write a review but this was a experience I had to share regarding flight #860 leaving ATL going to SFO. My boyfriend and I fly Southwest all the time, he is usually on a companion pass and I'm usually a reserved ticket. Very few times we've run into overbooked flights and missed connections. I noticed when ever we do hit these bumps in our travel the person at the ticket counter treats his situation totally different from mine. Makes one think - does the type of ticket a traveler has warrant the type of service he/she receives during these traveling hiccups? Any issues I have with my reserved ticket are handled promptly and with a pleasant demeanor. This particular time I was not traveling with my boyfriend and there was a hiccup with the flight. I purposely stayed on the phone while he went from Southwest Airlines employee to employee and every person was rude, and flat out didn't give the type customer service you would expect from one of the most respected airlines. Being at the Atlanta airport from 8:00 am till 4:00 pm and having no luck getting back to San Francisco, I'm sure he was ready to give up. Good thing we held on a little while longer. The ticket agent seemed to not care what type of ticket he had. Her main concern was making sure the customer ended up where he needed to be. Thank you 1,000 times over. I wish I could have been there to speak with someone on the spot. I only wish that the employees at the ticket counter treated all customers the same and handled their flight hiccups with the utmost professionalism no matter how stressed out they may be and no matter if it's a buddy pass, companion pass or reserved ticket. Thank you again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My flight was cancelled multiple times making my flight from Atlanta to Baltimore impossible. After waiting 10 hours in the airport I boarded a plane only to be taken off the plane 30 minutes later for ""engine problems"". After hours of cancellations and delays I was finally put on a direct flight to Boston from Atlanta, arriving in Boston 12 hours after I was originally scheduled to arrive. Then, my return flight from Boston to Baltimore was once again cancelled and delayed. I arrived in Baltimore 6 hours after I was suppose to. Next I discovered that my flight from Baltimore to Atlanta was cancelled, all other flights were full, and Southwest won't pay for me to take another airline. I ended up having to take a bus to DC in order to catch a flight to Atlanta. They refused to help or fix any of the problems they created for me and I will never fly with them again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Our flight from Baltimore to Tampa on July 11th was the best flight we've had on Southwest. Unfortunately our flight back home from Tampa to Albany wasn't as pleasant. No fault of our flight attendants. I purchased the early bird special option in order to get better seating for my daughter and I. It appeared that we had a decent spot for boarding until it was announced that this would be a connecting flight and there were already 90 people on board. I purchased the early bird to have a better chance at getting an isle seat due to severe claustrophobia. Not only were all the aisle seats taken but my daughter and I weren't even able to sit together. I ended up in a window seat and my daughter ended up in a middle seat two rows back. If that wasn't bad enough, we were pretty much the last people to exit the plane."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew Southwest 5 times in the month of July and was delayed at least 2 hours for every flight. My parents are flying home on Southwest as we speak and are delayed 3 hours. Their plane made it to the runway and now is receiving maintenance while passengers remain on the plane with no a/c. Add at least 2 hours to any trip you book with southwest. Unacceptable service."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flight from Seattle to San Jose - flight 923 - landed on time, but the connecting flight to Ontario - flight 4032 - scheduled to leave at 8.30pm was going to be delayed to an unknown time, as the lady behind the counter was telling us that the plane encountered mechanical problems but would post the exact departure time as soon as the plane was airborne. At exactly the same time the PA announcer explained the delay was due to fog over San Diego. Finally and after about two hours delay and the merging of the Phoenix flight with ours, we boarded heading to Ontario."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flight 2674 from Ontario to San Jose was delayed about 40 minutes, lady behind counter claimed delay was due to mechanical problems, suggested to carry our luggage on so we can catch up with our connecting flight -flight 862- to Seattle. Unfortunately or maybe fortunately or it could have been planned that way, the flight to Seattle, was also delayed over one hour. Was told 20 people on the same plane boarded the plane heading to Seattle."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I'm very upset that Southwest has chosen to implement this new boarding system. I'm flying with my 10y/o daughter. I checked in online and received what I thought were seat numbers. No, it was a boarding position. The flight was full and all the ""A boarding positions"" were taken so I couldn't even pay the extra $80 to increase the chances of my child sitting with me on the flight! I don't care where I sit on the plane, however, when I'm traveling with my 10 y/o daughter or any family, it's nice to sit with them. I would rather fly with an airline that assign seats upon check-in than to roll the dice to see if I can sit with my child. My first bag is free but to sit next to my child is $40 per ticket. Spirit Airlines doesn't even charge extra to assign seats to their passengers once they check in and Spirit charges for everything."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","This is the first time that I've flown WN, so I didn't really know what to expect. Check in at BOS was efficient and the attendants were friendly. I opted to purchase the ""early bird check in"" and was slotted at A53. The aircraft was nice and clean. The FAs were friendly, and were helpful. The flight left on time, and actually landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I had no problem finding a seat that I liked. Based on this one experience, I would recommend and fly WN again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","On a recent flight originating from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Richmond, connecting in Atlanta, the plane arrived to the terminal on time and was expected to depart on time. After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either. We took the flight to BWI, and had to get a rental at 2.00 am. Arriving home at 5.00 am, and with a extreme distaste for the way Southwest treats their paying customers, we decided never to use this carrier again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","It's become the ""usual now"" I am a loyal Southwest customer, fly 2-3 weeks each month. Now delayed 3+hrs due to maintenance issues in La Guardia. That's 3 substantial, over an hour, delays in last 4 flights. Sure makes it easier to pick other airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We were advised at Phoenix Airport that the plane would be leaving 45 mins late. Not good for us as we had to connect with an Air New Zealand flight to NZ and the arrival time would leave us rushing to check-in for this flight. Ground staff were very good and got us on to a previous flight due to leave in 20 mins. We made our connection. Earlier in the trip we flew Southwest, LA to Nashville and New Orleans to Phoenix - both flights approx 40 mins late. Also our friends from Canada flew Phoenix to Seattle, same story, about 40-45 mins late leaving. Last Monday, the 13th, our daughter flew from Las Vegas to LA. The plane left 40 mins late. With our future USA trips, we'll be re-thinking our airline travel stategy!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I was traveling alone with two children and was told I would board with the A group. Every plane was delayed. Then my returning flights home were delayed. No one could tell me why there were all these delays. Southwest is terrible all around. Then I get on my flight to Rochester only for the flight attendant to say there is no WiFi onboard. My flight was supposed to leave at 10.20pm than changed to 11.35, and I'm still sitting here after midnight."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","The gate/checking was in total disarray. The fare status was not updated, manual time displayed at the gate was outdated and the line was extremely long and stagnant at the gate. Passengers were not receiving adequate resolution or gate agents were not properly trained to address the situation. The gate was later changed with no communication, the boarding started with minimal communication. The flight was overbooked or consolidated with other flights and it was extremely uncomfortable. The flight did not leave at the updated delayed departure time posted. There was no communication from the staff who preferred to just talk to each other rather than the customers."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","After having an awful full day of waiting for each flight from DEN to MSP and not getting on any of them (flying standby) we had one last chance to get on the last flight out for the evening. A wonderful woman at the desk helped get us on and even got us priority boarding for my husband and I because I am 6.5 months pregnant and had been at the airport for 12 hours trying to get home with no luck."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Departed on time. Aircraft clean. Cabin crew friendly. In my opinion, Southwest always delivers a consistent experience."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest will fly you cheap. And they will be reasonably decent to you while you're flying with them. However if you ever need customer service from them it's different - when I called them, it took 112 minutes (no I'm not kidding) to get a human being on the line. When you're panicking because you've realized your wallet must have fallen out of your purse underneath the seat in front of you, and you just want someone to look for it, there will be no help for you. When you finally get a human being on the line, they will tell you to make a report online, and there's nothing else they're willing to do for you."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Traveled with spouse, daughter-in-law, and 18 month old grandchild. Purchased tickets for the adults in February, paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane, instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However, at Fort Lauderdale, when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child, the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23, her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed, several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding, you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat, too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane. Half of the passengers look like they are fleeing a war ravaged land carrying on huge bags or multiple bags. If the airline would support their seating and baggage policies all passengers would be much less aggravated."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Traveling with a family through Southwest Airlines was terrible because we did not know of the free seating rule, even though our tickets said we had assigned seats. When I asked the attendant about this issue she was rude to me and my family. On our way back we flew through Southwest Airlines as well and were delayed (without explination) we had to spend the night in Chicago, paid for out of pocket! They tried to help us get a hotel but they booked us one in the wrong airport and almost made us pay for two hotel rooms. When we returned back to the Midway airport our next flight was also delayed making us late for work the next day."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I am beyond disappointed with the delays I have experienced with Southwest Airlines lately. I have had a total of 8 flights with them in the last 6 months and not a single one has left on time. I'm not talking a 15 min delay I'm talking hours. It's not easy flying with a toddler but when you add hours of delays its just miserable. Needless to say I will be flying a different airline on my next trip."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Well generally Southwest is great with its customers. However, today I have just experienced awful customer service. There were two people transferring from my connecting flight from Baltimore to Columbus. Two, would you think that they would have the luggage at an easy to reach area. Now, can't always blame the airlines for this. Lost luggage happens. However, the reason behind my lost luggage was outrageous. After landing 15 minutes early of the scheduled landing time, my flight waited for an hour on the runway. Almost missed the last connecting flight to Columbus. When announced the terminals, they also noted that Southwest is not responsible for your missed flight, if you do miss it. My flight left at 10.10, I boarded at 10. I enjoy Southwest but unfortunately my last couple of times flying with them have been miserable. The other time, I was at the airport for 10 hours waiting on their planes, because they were delayed in the schedule. Again sometimes you can't do much about it, but figure it out!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","PVD-BWI-DTW-BWI-PVD Outbound legs to Detroit uneventful and handled with Southwest efficiency. Return legs were problematic as there was a line of severe thunderstorms over Baltimore causing severe scheduling problems for one of the major hubs for Southwest. Southwest came through and got us back to Providence, albeit two hours late. The terminal monitors in Detroit kept us well informed of delays and the Southwest app (although a bit slow in updating) did also. For the people who complain about the boarding methodology of Southwest, it is a bit strange for the uninitiated, but it works and has worked successfully for many years. If you insist on assigned seating, don’t fly Southwest - simple as that. It is an airline that admittedly has its foibles, but even with that it is still an excellent product! ."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My father was flying home to Syracuse NY afer a stay in a nursing home/rehabilitation center. His travel needs were significant as he was unable to walk and confined to a wheelchair. He was traveling with my 77 year old mother and my sister. Southwest Airlines was beyond accomodating and helpful with all of their needs. We were all very worried about managing this trip, and every employee, whether on the phone or at the airport were reassuring and kind to us!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","The trip from the Love Field Airport to Denver was decent. Flight attendants were nice and friendly on an early morning. Denver back to Dallas was hilarious, because the flight attendants were funny and made the flight enjoyable. However, I came back with my luggage and garment bag torn up. Not a bad airline to fly, but awfully handled my belongings."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My friend and I flew Southwest from DAY-TPA on June 6 with a return flight June 10. The outbound aircraft was one of the old Air Tran 737s, a little frayed around the edges, but perfectly servicable. The return flight was on a newer 737-700, everything was new and bright. Both aircraft were clean, and staff was friendly, professional, and courteous. My only complaint was that the seats seemed a bit narrow and I am not a big guy. The outbound flight was on time, while the return flight was delayed three hours by a thunderstorm over the airport. This was my first time flying Southwest and I will definitely be flying them again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flight 448, June 8th. Southwest has the most asinine check in process ever. I tried to check in online, but they refused to give me a boarding pass. Then I tried to check in at the curb and they gave me a boarding pass but wouldn't give one to my wife because she wasn't checking a bag. So we had to check in three times before we knew if we had a seat on the plane or not."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","5/21 flight 686 Detroit to Atlanta flight 722 Atlanta to Houston. 5/26 flight 4577 out of Houston to Atlanta flight 849 Atlanta to Detroit. Flight down went fine. Flight back different story. Had bad weather in Houston. Did not update flight schedule so we didn't have time to check our bags according to the rules. Guess that is where our mistake was. Flight was delayed 1.5 hours (missing flight attendants) but would not inform us as to how long the delay would be (so the bags stayed with my son in Houston). If we would have known what was going on we could have gone back out to my waiting son and got our checked baggage. Numerous calls same lines of ""really sorry but we can't......."". Cost me $150 to ship UPS. Ran through Atlanta airport to catch our connecting flight almost missed that. Had to beg then they let us. They really couldn't tell we had a connecting flight that was late? Are you kidding me?"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest Airlines has repeatedly let me and my family down with late-delays arriving late flights not going out at all. This has been the worst experiences of my life. The plane arrived a half hour late when we tried to take off we ended up being 11 in line to take off on the runway (which if there was a line we should be 30 mins ahead of the spot we were in). After waiting an hour on the runway we were unable to take off due to a storm that was off in the distance (not a big deal if they were on time however it was their fault for being late and getting caught in the storm). I have flown SW about 4 times now and not once have had a flight on time. Very poor quality team members I do not recommend this service to anyone trying to connect to a flight at different airport as most likely you will miss that flight."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","May 16 2015. What a disappointment. I have flown SW before and have been very satisfied until yesterday. I flew with my wife son his wife and two grandchildren ages 1 and 3. You could tell right off a couple of stewardess's were not happy we had kids. One was very rude acting as though it was her company. Yes inflight they started crying what are we to do not fly? We did all we could to calm ""the children"" down. It lasted about 1/2 an hr in all believe me it was worse on us as we tried to keep them quiet. The people behind us were making comments out loud and then when we got off the plane we find out from friends of ours in the back of the plane said how the steward's were rudely commenting about our kids. I will say that there was one stewardess older that was compassionate."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I guess some people on this board either don't travel much or don't do their homework. I have traveled quite a bit over the last many years I don't do much anymore but when I do I at least check things out. Many seem to be surprised at SW boarding procedures can't say I love it but at least I understand it. I paid the twelve dollars for a seating upgrade got A-37 out and A-43 back. Got on with plenty of seats and overhead space. If you don't like the charge go on another airline and pay $30+ to check your bag. The trip was fine but airline travel anymore is like bus travel used to be don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed or pay 5 times as much and go first class on another airline. I'm no spring chicken 70 years old and the seats are not great but again it's a bus not an airliner. I did fine would fly SW again if they had the best price and routing I always check around. All I can say is they got me there on time and that's what I paid for."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Not allowed off the plane to get dinner during a one hour layover in Chicago. We had a 4 hour flight to Vegas ahead of us and we were told in Atlanta (our originating city) that we would be able to get off and get dinner in Chicago therefore we did not eat in Atlanta. We had 7 hours until we finally landed in Vegas to eat dinner 11.45pm (EST). Rude service refused to let us go and we had to sit on the plane for an hour while other passengers boarded. There was more than enough time to quickly grab food at the fast food venues next door. Very disappointed with the rude staff."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Travelled ATL to MSY and back. Not able to check in early so ended up in the mid-B range both ways. Full planes but boarding went very smoothly except for the obese lady who needed two seats! We managed to get two seats together on the way back but were separate on the way out but its only a short flight. Seat reasonably comfortable with enough knee room. Soft drink and pretzels provided. Very good price. SWA use the Concourse C at ATL so by the time we had made our way to Baggage Reclaim it was starting to come off. Would use SWA again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Rude staff disorganized boarding misinformation about boarding procedures packed in like rats in the smallest seat space I've seen. My friend 79 and I 70 flew to St Louis at the last minute on Southwest because of the price. I had called Southwest in advance to ask about their boarding process. ""Oh don't worry"" I was told ""You'll get boarding numbers together and will be able to choose seats that are together"". Nothing was said about their Early Bird Boarding. We boarded in the ignominious ""C"" group which means that there were only scattered middle seats left. I wound up in the middle. He wound up in the front. His carry-on suitcase was somewhere in the back. When I explained to an attendant that we were concerned about that baggage she said that there was nothing she could do to help me. Southwest lets oversized carry-ons aboard which fills up the overheads quickly. I would suggest that if you are over 60 years of age that you avoid Southwest Airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew SWA from Tampa to Baltimore in April. It went well except for the boarding. We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable. If you fly SW do get priority boarding or you could end up in a seat like that."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","22/03/15 - 29/03/15 a total of 7 flights over that time starting at BWI Baltimore and ending up at John Wayne CA via MDW SLC DEN and OAK. All left on time and arrived on time or early. Cannot fault them in any way given all flights were getaway tickets the price was right as well. From booking each flight to checking in and arrival they run rings around most other airlines in the USA and the EEC. Those who moan about free seating pay the extra few bucks and get an A boarding place you can afford that as your checked bags go free other wise stop moaning."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have had the worst experience with Southwest Airlines. My plane was initially supposed to board at 7.15 pm and departure at 7.45 however we did not start boarding until 7.50. Once on the plane we waited 20 minutes to depart but then the captain spoke informed us that the plane had been fuelled with too much fuel so we were going to have to wait 15 minutes for the de-fuelling process. After 25 minutes a Southwest Airlines representative came on the loud speaker apologized and informed us that the de-fuelling process would take about 70-90 minutes - not 15. I am very irritated by this Southwest experience and I know my fellow passengers were too."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Horrible customer service representatives that are inefficient and inconsiderate. They diverted our flight and repeatedly made empty promises about time constraints which made it impossible to make other flight plans. The crew while nice gave no sympathetic apologies and just plainly didn't seem to care about situations aside from their own. Saying ""we're in the same boat as you are"". I thought that was rude considering they aren't in the same boat they're getting paid for this and should be apologizing profusely for the circumstances and lack of information communication to the passengers. This was without a doubt the worst experience I have had with an airline and I would not recommend using it for future trips. On top of all of this their boarding process is idiotic and if you have later back than A30 you better be ready to ride in the middle seat."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SWA 737-700 IND-RSW March 21st. We booked Southwest airlines Wanna Get Away for a very cheap price so we could sit together we paid for early bird check in and we were in Group B. I have to say I will now be flying Southwest almost exclusively because of the free IFE (although you need a device yourself) and the service is great. The 737 is also one of the more comfortable planes in the sky and I would much rather fly on it than a small RJ on Delta or having to connect in Charlotte. Overall I'm very happy with this airline and I look forward to my next flight with them."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have been traveling business select with Southwest twice a month for the past 3 years. I pay the extra money so I can board first to get my preferred window seat up close to the front on the Port side of the plane in order to quickly un-board either for another connection flight or to get on the road. My question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the un-boarding taking up most of the preferred seating area. Another question: I flew in on flight 2230 from New Orleans to San Antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in Dallas. Once we arrived in Dallas and everyone un-loaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to S.A. Then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to S.A. After several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight (we never received an answer) then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people. This plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 San Antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAS-LAX-LAS. Bizarre boarding process but once you get your head round it boarding is very quick. Extremely friendly crew on both flights. Complementary drink and baggage policy is excellent! Very easy to amend flights and with no charge! You don't get that with the low cost airlines in the UK!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","The worst airline I have flown. San Diego to Vegas Friday 13th Feb. At check-in told there is no allocated seating. Nowhere to sit in departure lounge hardly anywhere to stand. We were in one of the last groups to board as we moved into the line the girl handling boarding called us to the front to tell my daughter who is pregnant that she was allowed priority boarding as she is classed as disabled being pregnant. We accepted it and boarded sat at the rear of the cabin but luckily sitting together no room in overhead lockers so glad we had checked bag in. Never come across such an untidy cabin crew. Turned down the offer of a drink and was shocked they serve peanuts must be one of the few airlines that still do. Return flight on the 15th played the pregnant card for all it was worth boarded first row one seat locker for baggage no improvement in cabin crew. It was a once only flight with them we are spoiled in Australia with our airlines who get it right most of the time."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","On our trip to USA used Southwest Airlines from LA to Sa nFrancisco - Atlanta - Orlando - Las Vegas and then back to LA (5 flights) excellent service. We were recommended to ask for pre-board due to 2 young children with a disability seating was not a problem. Staff were extremely nice to us. Recommend Southwest to our friends."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Just flew from Orlando to Austin. Even though I was informed that there was WiFi there wasn't any. My wife tried to use the restroom and she said that the condition was horrible. I wonder if this was cleaned between flights. Any announcements were unintelligible due to poor sound system and the speed of speech. I tried to contact their customer service and I noticed that it's about the only department that does not have a toll free number. I rest my case."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Traveled with Southwest for the first and definitely last time. They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits. But low-cost savings are not actually saving you anything when situations like that happens and they are not worth it. Not flying with Southwest anymore. Do not recommend."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Took a flight from Southwest last week to Las Vegas. Upon trying to return home from Las Vegas my flight was canceled because of equipment problems. There were no other connecting flights that day for my itinerary. As a result Southwest offered several alternatives. We stayed an additional night in Vegas as a result. This was paid for by Southwest. All transportation was supplied by Southwest to and from the hotel. This was first class service! My only peeve and it is a small one was that I had an ""A"" first on pass originally and my replaced flight the next day was a ""B"" category. The flight crew on all flights was excellent."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Traveled Buffalo - Tampa at end of January. First time flyer with SW. Purchased early bird check-in in a bid to protect a better boarding position (and overhead bin space). Was assigned mid-A group so did get the seat location and bin space I was after. The entire boarding process is just a bit too odd for my liking with numbered posts and suspicious-looking 'post squatters.' I didn't need a calculator to know there were some queue jumpers at least within the 'A' group. Seating is just ok I thought the pitch was a bit tighter than the 32"" advertised and while I got the seat location I wanted I ended up with a group 'C' middle-seat'r who felt entitled to both armrests and wasn't exactly on the lean side. The in-flight service was fine the aircraft new and bright the flight crew fairly amenable and the flight left and arrived on time. Just can't get past the boarding system though. It just seems too cattle-roundup oriented."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Friday 13th 2015 flight 2745 from San Diego to Phoenix. I will never fly Southwest again gate agent was so rude bossing people around and just the worst customer service ever. And of course the seating is a total nightmare not sure how this airline is still in business."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Tampa FL to Phoenix AZ on 2/5. Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option. Evaluation: do not spend the extra $25 - it is a total waste of money."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","While traveling from Mexico to SAT my wife and I decided to give Southwest our first try we travel about 3 to 4 times out of DSM and we had never used your services. The flight was delayed about an hour because of some issues with landing at the prior airport once we boarded the plane the captain apologized for the inconvenience I wasn't aware of the seating process either but yet happy to be able to seat anywhere in the airplane the 3 flight attendants were extremely attentive with my two children they offered a lid for my sons cup so he wouldn't spill his juice all over his homework. They made us feel like they cared about us and they seem happy to be there. When one of the flight attendants realized we were a military family she offered to pay for our drinks. something not one other airline had ever done. Overall it was a very pleasant flight."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew from Richmond to Fort Myers by way of Atlanta. I was boarded and the problems began. Plane was supposed to leave at 4.25. After 30 minutes of waiting they told the passengers that an outside compartment was stuck open. Had to call maintenance in. Over an hour delay we took off. I asked flight attendant about my transfer in Atlanta she snipped back check at the gate. Got to the gate to find out my connecting plane was already boarding. Went to board and was told my ticket was not good. Got out of line and went to try to resolve this issue. They had changed my flight to the next day. Finally got it straight. Asked about luggage they said no problem it would be on the plane with me. I was the last to board and a day later still no luggage. Very disappointed."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","RNO-LAS LAS-RNO. As always on this route SW delivers. Ground staff in Reno were great and flexible. On time departure flight crew attentive and the pilot even pointed out sights of interest on the way down. Luggage arrived promptly in Vegas. Return flight just the same. Will continue my loyalty to this airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew WN twice this week: BDL-BWI-RSW and RSW-ATL-BDL. Both flights were on time. Attentive and congenial ticket counter gate and inflight personnel who really seemed to enjoy their job and their customers. The crew on the BWI-RSW leg actually sang portions of the pre-departure announcements. Having been subjected to callous treatment and the ""we don't care we don't have to"" attitude of personnel on some of the other airlines Southwest is a refreshing change of pace. They won me over."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on. Southwest has given me an experience that I would gladly repeat many times."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","First I don't know how anyone that left a review here can honestly say they had plenty of room you all must be very small people. This plane ride from John Wayne Airport to Houston was miserable the free seating is probably the worst idea ever. To make it worse they don't care about your boarding pass order I got on the same as a C31 when I was a B1. The plane is so cramped I could not even put my tray down without it being on my knees. The flight had no delays although for comfort I would take a delay. The ""free"" wifi is a marketing scheme they actually charge you 8 dollars and you are extremely limited on what you can do. This was a round-trip both times family and friends were trying to save seats. This is supposed to be first come first serve - I did not get to sit with the person I traveled with. Instead both times I sat in the middle seat with people about as big as I am."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My only complaint is that individuals and families were trying to ""save"" seats for other people on a full flight. Seating is a first come first served basis. That's the reason for the line up when boarding the plane. If you can't get your boarding passes together then don't expect to sit together. Southwest needs to make an announcement at the beginning of the boarding session to ensure that people know this."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Recently my wife and I had a round-trip to Jamaica. Our flight 1042 from Chicago on Dec 26 was delayed 1.5 hrs because one of the lavatories was found non-operational. However the crew learned about it after all passengers had boarded the plane. Boarding started on time on the way back from Montego Bay however after a third of all passengers had boarded the crew found out that 3 seats were non-operational. The flight (Jan 2nd #1043) was oversold. It took a while to find 3 passengers who agreed to take another flight by delaying their return to Chicago. Could the problem with 3 seats identified before starting the boarding? I think Southwest has some opportunities for improving operations."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SAN-LAS. Dec 31st. B737-700. Crowds and crowds. But everything went Ok with SW. Lines to drop off were quick. Boarding was quick. Flight was quick. Even luggage delivery in LAS was quick. The quicker the better. And 2 suitcases for free is fantastic. LAS-BUR. Jan 2nd. B737-700. Same thing. In both cases they said free wi-fi but try to charge. I did not understand."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We flew round trip from Baltimore Washington International to Aruba on December 22 2014. We arrived at 6am for our 8.45 am flight and the lines were long for check in. Curbside check in was not any better. The International line was shorter so we were able to process through in a reasonable amount of time. It was a nice flight with no problems. For our return trip the hotel staff recommended that we get to the airport three hours early. The check in process was very well handled and we even went through the United States Customs before boarding the plane. This made it very easy when we arrived in Baltimore to grab our luggage and go. The return flight had the best flight crew I have ever flown with. The attitude and customer service skills made this flight very enjoyable. Our only complaint was there was no inflight movies available for a 4.5 hour flight."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My wife and I experienced Southwest at it's worst on a flight from Montego Bay Jamaica - you just can't make this up. Flight Delay in MBJ - 3pm flight left MBJ AT 9:30pm told that the plane was originally diverted due to Southwest forgetting to renew its license to fly over Cuba. Complete lack of communication by Southwest staff during 6 hour delay. Once on the plane at MBJ the cabin crew promptly told us that the delay ""was not their fault so don't take it out on us"". No apology - just that statement. Deplaning delayed 15 minutes at MCO due to incorrect gate height. 1+ hour wait after customs at Southwest counter for new flight and hotel/flight voucher - there were only 2 agents. Couldn't get a flight voucher as Southwest took all computers down for their own overnight daily maintenance. Had to go back and stand in line again in the morning to receive flight vouchers. Rebooked flight of course had C boarding group - had to beg for the ""heart"" stamp by agents to allow us to board as B1. Flight to MHT on the 14th was delayed 30 minutes making us have to run to make our connection in BWI."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew SWA in the last week from BWI-RSW-BWI. First plane was older (737-300) had no WIFI. Seats in the older plane seemed larger/more comfortable than the newer one. Bathroom wasn't cleaned very well (if at all). Second plane was newer (737-700) and had WIFI but it was $8 for a 2 hour flight so I didn't buy it. Other than that they got us to each location on time."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SFO-LAS flight delayed 20 minutes which is fine considering its a budget airline I didn't expect much on the service complimentary 2 pieces check-in baggage is very delightful spacious legroom friendly cabin crew free soft drinks served very enjoyable experience with SouthWest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My family my husband and I and our two children ages 11 and 14 are well seasoned travelers. We live in the NY area and fly out of LaGuardia several times a year. We know LaGuardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. This weekend was the first time we've ever flown Southwest. Southwest is the worst airline we have been on. Who came up with no assigned seating? We were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in ""line B"" while we were in ""line a"". We had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isn't strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. There were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over $1000 for our flights (in total) were even going to be seated together. Our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. I never book a flight unless I can see the seating chart and pick our seats before I pay for the flight. This wasn't even an option for us. So I was anxious because I was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. I had to set my alarm on my phone so I remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. Our flight out of LaGuardia was a nightmare! There's nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. So my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. There were no TV monitors on telling us when we were going to board. We had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasn't even a plane at the gate. And they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment. They never announced when we were going to start boarding. And once on the plane we sat on the ground for an hour and a half and the pilot never came on and told us we had a delay and how long it was going to be. I do know that I will never fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Las Vegas to Baltimore then to Portland. Our scheduled flight from Baltimore to Portland was delayed (sick crew member). Southwest gave a $100 LUV voucher. They also don't charge to change or cancel flights. They need to make sure that carry on bags will fit in overhead compartments. Many did not and had to be checked which delayed the flight."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","On November 6 2014 flew from West Palm Beach to Las Vegas via Atlanta in Business Select. Had not flow SW in years but it is apparent the service has deteriorated. The open seating is a joke and as well as the Business Select status. Pre Boards get the best seats which are clearly exit rows and the first row. I was traveling with someone who is 6'3"" and 275lbs. and it was torture for them to sit in a very small seat with no leg room to elbow room and hard seats. Staff are rude and have poor attitudes."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My mother and I arrived into Dayton Ohio last October and surprisingly there was a wheelchair on the jet way. My mother uses a walker but we were advised to use the wheelchair because she would have a difficult time walking all the way to baggage claim. We were taken all the way to baggage claim through the rental car kiosk and then all the way to our rental car. We also had help to load our luggage. Same service on return and I can't say enough good things about it. Taken from the curb to the check in counter and all the way to our gate."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","First time in a while flying Southwest and as usual a pleasant straightforward experience. Easy-to-use website for reservations optional boarding pass for a few bucks extra fairly efficient boarding. My flight was from BWI to Las Vegas and I opted to pay $8 for WiFi. Southwest fulfilled their goal - moving me across the country in 5 hours or so - a great job without all of the hidden fees."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I just recently flew to the east coast departing from the west coast. This was the first time I tried flying with Southwest and have absolutely no regrets. I experienced no delays. My flights were on time and 30 minutes early at one of my layovers. I found the staff very nice and it made my flight fun. I will stay with southwest from now on when I fly. Thanks Southwest for such an enjoyable trip across country!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My husband and I both fly frequently between Ohio and New York and Florida so this review is based on many flights. Southwest has become my preferred airline. As a senior checking my bags for free means I don't have to lift a bag overhead that is getting increasingly difficult. No change fee means I don't have to buy insurance. The staff are wonderful boarding is done in an efficient way and you can get a convenient and moderately priced flight without having to fly at 5.30am. Would only use another when I have to match a specific time frame that is not available."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I love flying Southwest but the reason why I fly other airlines is do to the very slow baggage claim at Love Field. I took a flight from Cleveland to Love Field #4221 October 11 2014. It took one hour from the time our flight landed until the bags were delivered. One hour I could not believe it. They build that nice building but have no way of telling passages which of the four baggage carousels your bags will be delivered on so people scurry from one to another looking. Even after the bags arrive the Southwest team member usually is to busy to announce baggage drop until 4 or 5 bags have arrived. You spent a lot of money to rebuild that airport you would think that you could make the bags arrive in 20 or less minutes."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My family and I traveled last spring from Akron to Tampa on Airtran / Southwest Airlines. When we arrived at the airport the flight was delayed due to mechanical failure for 2 hours. Original posted delay turned into multiple delays promised another plane which didn't show when expected. 8 hours later we were still waiting. Our patience as well as the entire waiting crowd was gone. The staff at the gate were authorized to reimburse passengers with certificate travel for the inconvenience. Ok great (we thought). I have tried to use our certificates in several different ways. 1) We had already purchased tickets for a trip later in the summer (same airline) asked if we could cancel those and use the certificates NO. 2) Asked if we could use the certificates for additional family members to travel with us NO. 3) Tried to book a flight for another trip sorry certificate seats sold out. 4) Tried to book again on a different date NO because that put us past the travel dates on the certificate. 5) Last try today and told that the certificates are expired and no longer valid. What does a person have to do to use certificate travel? Travel to destinations nobody wants to go on dates no one wants to travel? If a certificate travel is given as a gesture of good will for inconveniences endured due to airline failure shouldn't the recipient be able to use at their convenience not the airlines?"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","This was the first time and last time I will fly Southwest - our flight was delayed in Chicago numerous times and our flight that should have left a couple of hours after we arrived finally left about 12 hours later. At one time we were boarded and then told the pilot had worked too many hours. We were given a $200 voucher $200 cash would have better since I will never fly Southwest again I will gladly pay more with another airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","DCA-MDW on Oct 1 with B737-700 flight delayed 30 minutes which is fine cabin is clean and really spacious legroom even it's budget airline. I was surprised that complimentary beverages and chips were served! Complimentary movies and TV shows provided when you connected inflight wifi with own devices. Staff very helpful and friendly. Will fly with Southwest again definitely!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Sep 14 on flight 648 from DEN to PHL and Sep 20 on flight 1329 from PHL to DEN. So impressed with Southwest! Just finished our fourth flight with our infant son and I'm just so thankful for the amazing crews we've dealt with each time. So understanding and accommodating. As first time parents we really appreciated the great service."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I paid for the early bird check in as I do on most of my flights. I checked in online the day before at 3.30pm which is 5 hours after I needed to if I didn't pay for the earlybird check in. When I check-in I was given A31 and A32 but didn't print my boarding pass as I didn't have access to a printer. The next morning before my flight I printed my boarding pass and was given B32 and B33. When I got to the gate I asked the front desk women at the gate what was going on. She said ""we don't guarantee what number you get."" I told her that I checked in and received A31/32 and she told me again. ""We don't guarantee the numbers."" I told her that this was a rip-off and that if I wasn't traveling with another family I probably wouldn't have made a big deal but since they also checked the same time I did and they received B28/29/30 and didn't pay for the earlybird that something was wrong. She told me that there is nothing she can do and I'd have to write Southwest for a reply. She looked things up on her computer and said that the earlybird for this flight never went through on my flight back. I will be looking for other airlines for my flights for now on."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Live near BWI one of SW biggest hubs. Use SW for short non-stops but even those are becoming intolerable. Flight attendants show up after boarding time. Apparently unconcerned that delay 150 or so people so they can have 10 more minutes to do whatever. Rude instructions when boarding. Told to put my bag in bin down the aisle despite having space above my seat ""to save room for other bags"" unbelievably stupid as I have to go against traffic to retrieve bag now. They've gone from a ""cattle car"" (based on their Southwest origins) to a chicken coop. They advertise heavily ""bags fly free"" - didn't know they meant they would treat live human customers as baggage."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I was a loyal Southwest customer who hadn't flown in a while. After five flights within the same week all I can say is Southwest isn't what it used to be. For a 6'5"" 200 lb person the new seats are sheer torture. And on every flight I encountered too many passengers being crammed in to too-small planes. It's no surprise that every logistic being run on such a razor's edge makes for a stressful experience. God help you if you have to endure any connecting flights. The schedules are so tight now that they have no time to even clean the planes between boardings and there are lots of delays. What a terrible atmosphere we encountered. The staff tries their best to pretend they aren't running a grim cattle drive but no one is fooled. I guess corporate has decided to maximize volume and profits over any considerations of passenger comfort. Too bad. Southwest used to be different from the sleazy mentalities running most other airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We have always loved Southwest Airlines. Over the years they have become our ""go to"" airlines. That's why the first time there was mechanical delay we didn't let that impact our view of the airlines. Then in the same week we had another mechanical delay. Now don't get me wrong I would much rather them find out problems while the aircraft is still on the ground! Today ( all delays have been within the same week and half) there is another mechanical delay! This makes three in a short time span. What's going on with Southwest airlines aircraft? As I said before I would rather find problems on the ground but three delays on three different aircraft's all mechanical issues is reason for concern! It turns out a mechanic accidentally opened up the bathroom sewage and it poured out into the aisle of the plane. No one is getting on that plane anytime soon!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I will never fly Southwest again. They claim there is no assigned seating but you can purchase ""Early Bird Check- in"" which they claim automatically checks you in 36 hours in advance instead of the usual 24 hours. So I purchased the Early Bird check in plan thinking that my whole family would be able to sit together. (Group A-so I thought). Surprise when I received my boarding passes we were in Group B which means you have less that a 50% chance of your family seating together. I called Southwest and was told that the Early Bird Check in does not guarantee anything it just gives you the best available boarding at that time Well they didn't tell me this when they took my money. So in order to ensure that my family would be together I had to spend more money and purchase First-In boarding passes (Group A) for an additional $40 per person (One way). The plane was small cramped no room to even think about being comfortable. I am an average size man (5'11 195 lbs). I can't imagine how someone bigger must have felt. Then imagine my surprise when the flight attendant announced to the final group of people boarding (Group C) to take the first available seat because they were saving the seats in the back for families so they could sit with their children. Twice I spent money to guarantee my family would sit together because they claim there is no assigned seating and now they are saving seats for families so they can sit together Are they serious!! Either you have assigned seating or you don't. Which is it? It is clear that Southwest doesn't have their act together and I believe they are not worth the hassle. I won't fly them again and certainly would not recommend them to anyone."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I recently flew with Southwest. I was extremely disappointed in the dysfunctional boarding system. Although I was aware that the Southwest boarding system was different I had no idea how poorly it could work in reality. Long story short: whatever you do do not pay extra for a business select ticket. I needed to travel within the last few weeks from St Louis International airport to Washington Dulles International airport. I would have preferred a direct flight but being able to stow both carryon bags without using gate check is a big plus. In order to get a better seat on the airplane I paid the extra money for a business select ticket. This puts you near the front if not at the front of the line. Southwest seating is first come first serve. On my way to D.C. the system worked well enough although on my first flight I did not get a great seat as I was boarding in position A15. That didn't bother me much the system had worked as designed. My second flight I was first in line and pretty content with the outcome. However on one of my return flights things got extremely frustrating. The problem started when it was time to board after a layover at Midway airport in Chicago. Now I first want to say that I support the idea of allowing people who are handicapped to pre-board. But I do not support the idea of letting them take all the best seats on the plane. My ticket from Midway to St Louis had me boarding in position A1 theoretically the very first passenger to board if not for pre-boarding. There were four pre-board passengers ahead of me. When the gate agent called for pre-boarding around six more family members who were clearly strong healthy adults decided to board with them. Not acceptable. By the time I got on the plane all of the very best seats with extra leg room in the front row where taken. The four very best seats where occupied by the healthy family members who decided that they were entitled to board with their handicapped family members. Why can't Southwest declare the front row an ""exit row""? It is an exit row! That would prevent pre-boarders from sitting there. What did I pay extra for to get priority seating if Southwest is just going to give those seats away to some very dishonest people? In the end: I paid and they did not deliver. I recommend that if you choose to fly Southwest do not pay extra for the business select ticket. I personally will not be flying Southwest again under any circumstances."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I was hesitant to fly Southwest because I'd heard the ""cattle call"" remarks from others but honestly it was fine. I paid the $25 for my sister and I to do the early bird check-in which I will always do from now on. We boarded quickly and took off on time. I enjoyed sitting up front on the way to Phoenix (I'm claustrophobic so the extra room made for a more comfortable feeling overall). Coming back we were a few rows back and it was cramped for sure. That's to be expected on a smaller jet with smaller seats. For a domestic flight it's doable. What I was really impressed with was the overall attitude and presence of the crew. I have always flown Delta in the past and was surprised to see the pilots before the flight. The flight attendants were very nice. The flight back to Atlanta was interesting as there were weather issues but the pilot did a great job of navigating around and through the worst of it I believe as there was hardly any turbulence. I'll fly SW again for sure."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","On-time flights don't exist. I had 2 round trip flights in 2 weeks for a total of 4 departures. All 4 were 20-30 or more minutes late. 100% failure rate for that. Your luggage flies for free but that doesn't outweigh the chronic tardiness issue. If you want in flight entertainment you must download their app but I couldn't ever get it to work. User error I'm sure. At least they provided a quarter of a soda in a cup during the flight. If you book Southwest your flight will be late. That is the Southwest guarantee."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Plane was supposed to depart at 10.25AM it is 11.20am now and we are still waiting to leave. No beverages have been offered and everyone on the flight is becoming frustrated. They made an announcement while I am writing this review. They said ""we are still repairing the aircraft and we will update in 15 minutes or so."" This is absolutely ridiculous. A full flight sitting in a hot plane for an hour now and we are about to take off in a plane that has just been repaired. My multiple time flying with Southwest and this will be my last."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We are flying from Birmingham to Albany. Before deplaning we learned there is an hour delay for our 2 hour layover in Baltimore. We are not surprised as my husband had a 2 hr delay from Albany to Jackson a few days ago my sister in law had a 2 hr delay flying from DC to Panama City and we were delayed 3 hrs flying from LaGuardia in our layover in Nashville. If you want to get anywhere on time I would suggest a different airline. We have almost a full day of list time in delays and have been offered no apologies and no compensation. This is our vacation time and we work hard all year for it it is valuable family time and we've paid richly to be robbed of it. I will never fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My 94 year old mother-in-law and I flew Southwest from San Jose CA to Austin TX on July 29th 2014 and she flew back alone on August 16th 2014. We had outstanding service in every way before and on both flights. The folks who met us with her wheelchair were so accommodating polite and respectful. The ticket agents helped us in every way possible even when we thought we had some difficult issues. The attendants on the plane were very friendly and so kind. We and she alone on the way back could not have asked for better service. We will both definitely fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","San Diego to Las Vegas 13th Aug. Las Vegas to San Francisco 15th Aug. Seeing as people seem to only write bad reviews about Southwest I decided to write a very positive review. I had 2 separate flights with Southwest in a week. Both flights were excellent. Most probably the friendliest staff and crew I have come across on any airline. The emergency demonstrations are witty and funny and do not sound like a robot that does not want to be there. They also offer free beverages and a small snack on board which is a nice gesture to get you through a short flight. There are a very efficient airline. We had no delays and baggage was returned quickly once off the aircraft. I would recommend Southwest to anyone flying within the US. They are truly cheap and cheerful."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","August 16 flight 74 Indianapolis to Orlando. In great contrast to our August 11 trip from Orlando to Indianapolis (Flt 4453) that provided the usual friendly service from Southwest attendants our experience today was the exact opposite. Upon boarding our experience was very positive with the attendant who seated us and helped with storing our carry-ons. We never saw that person again since she must have been working the back of the plane. The attendants in the front of the plane (a male and female) did their job and that was about it - bare minimum. From the outset when we boarded they seemed to lack interest were detached and somewhat edgy. I noted the male attendant was unnecessary rude to two male passengers when he could have been much more polite in both verbal exchanges that I overheard."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My wife and I are from Australia but when we come to the States we try to fly Southwest whenever practical because they deserve the business due to their fair business practices and good service. We've always appreciated that they don't charge for luggage and that a person can change flights without any charge. We flew them a number of times last month and I can say only good things about them. We will continue to support them in the future when we come to the States and I wish they operated here in Australia."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","July-August 2014. Los Angeles-Midway Chigao-Louisville-Las Vegas-Los Angeles. Once again excellent airline. Cannot find anything to complain about. Staff and service fantastic. On time. Of course food and beverages you pay for but have no issue with that. 2 free checked luggage a bonus."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flight 2534 BWI to Providence on 17 Aug return BOS to BWI on 19 Aug on 3059 travelling to Cape Cod. I was a little apprehensive about flying Southwest having read the reviews but I must confess I was very impressed. Boarding was carried out promptly and according to the rules of seating on both flights. Both flights left on time the flight attendants were pleasant and engaging. On the return flight the pilot met passengers at the door and shook my hand and thanked us for flying Southwest! Drink orders were processed promptly and small snacks were handed out. The return flight had in flight wifi with TV and movies on demand. All in all it was value for money and when I am back in the US I would use them again without a doubt."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX-MKE-SEA. For me Southwest has always been a superb US domestic carrier and these trips were no different. A tip is to purchase for $10 the early check-in which gets you into the A group boarding. well worth the efforts not to have to fight for a seat."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew on Flight 3276 from ATL to TPA on August 9. This was my very first flight on Southwest and hopefully my last as they kept on delaying the flight to avoid paying for hotel rooms for passengers who were late coming from a connecting flight. I will say that I have never experienced this flying with multiple other airlines and I will do everything I can from here on to avoid flying with Southwest Airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I heard last week that Southwest is the largest airline in the US now. Unfortunately I think their growth has resulted in decreased novelty and satisfaction. I do fly it on a regular basis because they service MDW from LAX but I find that the amount of space for seats is poor the wifi is the worst that I have found in the market in recent years (I work a lot on planes and SW wifi is very very slow). It is not worth looking at inflight snacks as the quality is so poor. It is now just an airline with less than average amenities."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I recently traveled from Louisville to Orlando no problems the flight was very smooth no problems with the luggage and arrived in Orlando thirty minutes ahead of schedule. The flight home went very smooth also no problems at all overall I was very pleased and plan on using Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We recently travelled from Burbank to Denver. This is the worst airline I have travelled with. The flight attendants were rude too with bad attitudes. This airline also allow full size cases on board instead of the usual hand luggage resulting in those with genuine hand luggage to force under a seat which resulted in cramped seating and no leg room. Thank goodness the flight was only 2 hours 20 minutes which was long enough in those conditions. They also don't allocate seating resulting in a free for all."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","85 boy Scouts took flight 63 on 8/2/14. All staff were so pleasant and went around 3 times to make sure we were good with drinks. That was really impressive. They were so kind and even let us know our gates for connecting flights. Nice job! Everything was great."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Currently on board the plane traveling from Chicago to San Diego using the wifi I purchased for a whopping $8.00. Aside from being able to access a few sites on my iPad (ironically this is one of them) the wifi enabled me to do virtually nothing. I could not open my Netflix/HBO app because they were incapable of connecting to the network so I tried their respective online websites to access my media. Once again the websites were unable to load due to the wifi and I found myself soon discovering more and more entertainment related websites/apps (games/music/etc.) were unable to load. Apparently their definition of wifi limits you to reading Wikipedia articles and twiddling your thumbs while you constantly refresh pages. Needless to say I will not be making this purchasing mistake again however I will be traveling Southwest again in my future as they are still by far the best bang for your buck!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I booked a trip to fly from Houston to Lubbock with a stop in Austin. The flight went smoothly from Houston to Austin in Austin I had a 2 hour stopover until my flight to Lubbock I fell asleep and missed my flight and when I went to the gate agent saying that I missed my flight she just shrugged and showed me two boarding passes and said I could get on a flight to Lubbock via Dallas I accepted and she gave me the boarding pass. The flight to Dallas kept getting delayed because of thunderstorms in Dallas. I finally got to Lubbock at 10.50. The next morning I went on Southwest.com and went to see if my points had posted I found out they didn't so I called Southwest and they told me that I didn't receive my points because I missed my original flight. I will never fly Southwest again because they have terrible service."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Due to a family emergency I was forced to fly SW again on Sunday August 3rd (even after I promised myself never again after 3 other bad experiences in SW). My first flight went out okay but the connection in Baltimore was awful. First they asked for 3 volunteers to trade their seats for $300 vouchers due to SW oversold the flight. After we finally boarded the plane the captain announces a mechanical malfunction so we all had to deplaned. They began lying to people in order to keep them calmed. after they decided that each flight should go in 2 different groups (Orlando and Raleigh) Another hour passed and we were still don't know the real reason we couldn't board a 2nd plane .Two hrs later they decided to switch gates again and telling us that because plane #2 also had a mechanical problem we have to now board plane #3! All of the sudden they announced that the two initial flights became one again what a mess! I finally arrived to my emergency 3 hrs later."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","It is too bad the people that seem to post on the web are the ones that have had poor experiences. I fly almost weekly on Southwest for the last 6 years. It is with trepidation that I fly other airlines as you never know what you are going to get-especially Delta. The customer service is second to none and the seats are always roomy and predictable. Unless you need the extra leg room such as an exit row if you check in at the 24 hour mark or pay the low fee to board early you have a large selection of seats. Rarely are they late. The staff are empowered to solve customer issues and do so readily. Airline tickets are easy to change and credit refund with no fees. Plus there is no baggage fee for the first 2 bags and their pricing is competitive. Airline miles are so easy to use including international. This airline develops trust based on their reliability and customer service. Definitely a loyal fan and steady customer!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flight 4111 on 7/26 and 3371 on 7/31. This airline not only messed up my flight down to Florida but also messed up my flight back home this is the worst airline choice you can possibly have if you decide to book a flight make sure you book it for the earliest possible time because you won't end up on a plane until the middle of the night anyways. This is such a terrible airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","FLL to MSP and return. Staff must've taken how to not smile and treat everyone like cattle as part of their classes because on every flight we took (there were 4 total for the round trip) all attendants were almost disgruntled employees. They looked like they ""had"" to be there. An elderly woman who couldn't sit with her young grandchild who was very nervous about that (because of their no assigned seats policy) was delighted when another customer volunteered to switch seats with her before they even started the seat belt instructions and the first flight attendant reprimanded them and then I saw her tell the second attendant who rolled her eyes. Come on that made the flight more enjoyable for everyone plus what was the big deal to them? Our soft drinks took almost the whole flight to get to us and then they ask for your garbage right after you start drinking it. The seats are comfortable enough but there is no perks to paying the extra $12 a ticket for the early bird check in unless you are just partial to a window seat. I got A30-36 boarding most times which is after the first A group picks all the leg room seats. The only thing I like is that you can control whether or not you sit in front of kids if you don't want to you find a seat in front of adults already sitting."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My husband took a flight to go to a funeral in Charlotte NC this past month. The flight down was fine the flight back however was a nightmare! They canceled the flight with no prior warning and did nothing to help their passengers from being stranded in the airport. In fact the customer service representative was horrendous. When I called to try to fix the problem she not only had no sympathy for the stress they were causing their customers but she also laughed at me when I was voicing my concerns about the fact that the only flight she was offering us was for Wednesday and his original flight was for Monday. The only solution she had was either take the Wednesday flight and figure out a place to stay for 2 nights or they will refund our ticket price (not the fees included with the ticket) and we were tasked with finding another flight with a different airline to get home. Southwest has no issue with leaving their customers stranded in an airport with no alternative plan than to find your own way home. I would never recommend them as they dont care about their customer experience at all and refuse to respond to complaints."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Went on vacation July 9-18. Flight out to Denver was ok - nothing special. Seats were very cramped. Flight 2068 back from Denver to Boston was horrible! To start flight was delayed twice. We were a party of 4 sitting all the way in the back. From the time we got in the air until about three quarters of the way through the flight the two female flight attendants and one male flight attendant were just horrible. When one of the females came around asking for beverage requests I asked for a coffee. Everyone in my party received their drink except me no coffee. But it got worse! After drinks were served these three attendants proceeded to stand in the back by the bathroom and galley and talk and laugh extremely loudly with no regard whatsoever for all of us in the back of the plane including two toddlers who were trying to sleep. They kept up their loud talking and shrieking laughter for over an hour. It was absolutely horrible and disrespectful. I will never fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Burbank-Phoenix SWA286. Phoenix-Buffalo SWA197. July 17th. My first time flying Southwest and I was very impressed. Customer Service was the best I have seen and I have been on United Delta American etc. I was flying from Burbank to Buffalo via Phoenix and the first flight was 15 minutes early and the 2nd flight was right on time! I read a lot of people on here do not like the seating policy I honestly love it it is very simple and you choose which seat you want and Southwest is known for being the quickest airline for planing and deplaning. Flight attendants were very nice I liked the humor they used for their announcements. You have complimentary non- alcoholic drinks and they give you a bag of peanuts and pretzels. All in all I would recommend Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","When and if Southwest changes its seating policy I will consider flying it again. Unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to ISP but I hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip I will fly into JFK and take a shuttle. SW likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true. There is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat. We paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who don't need the leg room but who had boarded first. Then we had to change planes. Unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldn't even sit together. Paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you. I'd rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed. The whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not. Then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together. The whole thing is absurd. On top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest. I can fly into JFK pay extra for premium seating and afford a shuttle for what a Southwest flight to ISP costs."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Our flight from Orlando to Denver was full. I checked in about 23 hours before departure and got group C boarding passes. They want you to buy the automatic check in so they can get extra money out of you. My wife and I had to sit about 6 rows apart. The return flight was delayed 1.5 hours and when we tried to switch to an earlier flight they wanted $347 to change so we waited. This flight we checked in for when we arrived at the airport and got group C again. Flight was full but we at least got seats across the aisle from each other. I'm done flying Southwest I would rather have assigned seating even if I have to pay a bit more. I don't know why the flight was delayed in Denver never got an explanation. Too many pre-boarders families etc. that your boarding pass doesn't really mean anything anyway."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SJC to PDX. I have never experienced such poor Customer Service in the 13 years I have been traveling with this airline. I have been getting the feeling that the service had lost its world renowned status for the last few years. I stayed with this airline for their frequency and on time performance. Despite having a huge incentive voucher from Alaska Airlines I will say that after this experience I have completely given up on Southwest Airlines as a competitor. I was greeted by a Customer Service Representative with a mouthful of French Fry! After being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. I asked why I was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport? The representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. After waiting four hours with no communication form Southwest employees an announcement was made. My flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers. The chaos that ensued was unreal. Before I knew what was happening there was a line of 100 plus passengers waiting to get vouchers. I opted to leave the airport and fly Alaska Airlines the next day."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We planned a trip from Pittsburgh Airport to Memphis Airport (supposed to be a 4hr 45min trip). We were traveling with a 3 yr old. We arrived at Pittsburgh Airport with our flight scheduled to leave at 6.30pm when checking in they said that our flight was delayed due to bad weather and offered to move us to a flight leaving at 4.45pm we agreed and actually made it in time to board. Once it was our turn to board we were told our boarding passes were not valid and had to get out of line to go back to the lady at the boarding counter to receive new boarding tickets. We finally boarded the plane and eventually made it to our first lay-over at Chicago Airport. Ended up waiting at this airport for almost 5 hrs for our plane to arrive. Yet again when trying to board we handed the lady our boarding passes and she scanned them and was told they were invalid. Again we had to get out of line and wait until we were cleared by whomever she called about the matter. After finally getting on the plane we waited an additional 20 minutes for a passenger who for some reason or another was late. Finally we landed at Memphis Airport at 11.15pm an hour behind schedule and thank goodness our rental car place was kind enough to wait 20+ minutes after they closed at 11pm so we could get our rental we had reserved. I was hoping our flight home would be less eventful not so lucky! We arrived at Memphis Airport and things went smoothly (I had high hopes after this) we arrived at Orlando FL airport. Once we arrived at Orlando airport things went downhill. We almost immediately found out that our 4.15 flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to ""weather"" and wouldn't be leaving until 6.45 pm. After trying to figure out a plan we called customer service at Southwest and was told that she didn't know why we were told that our flight was delayed due to weather in fact it had to make an emergency landing in Baltimore due to mechanical issues. 6 long hours later we finally took off around 7pm and arrived at Pittsburgh Airport 5 hrs behind schedule at 11.40pm. I can insure after this experience I will be flying with another airline!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Today when I showed at the airport I was informed that my flight would be late and that I had to be re-routed. This change puts me at my destination airport approximately 3 hours later than my original ticket. My wife and children now have to pick me up well past their normal bed time (our children are young). Additionally my boarding number is well past what I had checked in with for my original flight (instead of early B I'm now late C). I now have to wait at my departure airport 4.5 hours instead of my planned 1.5 hours. This type of customer handling is unacceptable. Southwest Airlines is supposed to be one of the top tier airlines in regards to customer satisfaction however my treatment today was truly unexpected. I should have been upgraded to business class seating (A1-A15) at least at a discounted price. Instead I was offered nothing for my inconveniences as well as my family's. I truly understand that things happen outside of Southwest's control but I think some concession should have been offered. This would have made me feel better. Instead I feel like Southwest's attitude towards it's passengers/customers is ""deal with it"" with a smile and a nod and a ""next customer please"" attitude."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Got delayed due to a maintenance issue with the plane. This happens of course but a few major issues. First they do not make announcements and let people know what is going on. It was past the scheduled departure time before they made any sort of announcement. All the announcement said was ""If you have connecting flights we are looking into possible changes. There is a problem with the plane we have no idea what it is."" Something along those lines. So all you know is that there is a problem with the plane? We all already know that or we would be in the air right now or at least on the plane. Next If you do have delays or cancellations in your flight Southwest does not pull seats from other airlines to book the affected passengers. Other airlines have done this for me in the past. This is obviously a huge issue. You may be waiting all day or even until the next day for another Southwest flight that isn't booked and is flying where you are going. And you can't even really fly to a nearby airport because Southwest doesn't service many cities. Other airlines care about keeping you informed and they will get your flight quickly changed if there is a cancellation or large delay. Southwest cannot and will not do the same."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My daughters were competing in Orlando Florida. My wife scheduled an 8.30 am flight 3 months ago to make sure to be there. Right after the passengers boarded the flight the pilot announced to passengers that there was a problem with the plane. The passengers deplaned and were told that SW was working on getting another plane a direct flight. There was no direct flight offered and after being told they would be leaving at 5 different times SW finally decided to bump the 3pm flight for the 8.30 am passengers. For all my wife's troubles she was given a measly $200 voucher. She could have driven from Dallas to Orlando faster than SW got her there."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest's Boarding Process has gotten completely out of control. I haven't flown on Southwest in about a year but my experience on a recent round-trip from Phoenix to Boston with connections proved repeatedly how flyers are abusing Southwest's boarding process. On the first leg I was assigned B38 since I did not pay for EarlyBird seating although I did check in exactly 24 hours before the flight. By the time they got to B31-60 practically the entire flight had boarded. At least 20 people were in the pre-board category about 5 A-list flyers who hadn't gotten an A number boarded after all the A's were called and then another 26 people boarded during ""families and children"". There were less than 30 people remaining to board the plane (which was entirely full) by the time they got to the B31-60 category - when technically there should have been 75-90 people left to board. This experience was repeated on all four flights and was worse when leaving BWI when a group of ""C"" pass holders snuck into the B segment and were not stopped by the gate agent. The final straw was the flight from Chicago to Phoenix. I watched a family walking through the airport to check-in at which point the parents asked for a wheelchair for their young daughter - who had been walking with them up to that point. A wheelchair was commandeered and they were expedited through the TSA check-point. Lo and behold when I arrived at my gate weren't they there - and with a pre-board pass. So clearly another way to bypass Southwest's procedures is just to commandeer a wheelchair and then you get to pre-board. It really is time for Southwest to just start assigning seats; the flying public it has been demonstrated will otherwise continue to outmanoeuvre and get around the ""rules."""
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I was scheduled to leave for Minneapolis at 7.55 last night. Yes there was a heavy rainstorm and yes flights were delayed. But Southwest seems completely incapable of telling passengers what's going on or correcting a problem. I was then told the plane would leave at 11.15 then it's leaving at 12.15 am. Then it's leaving at 1.30 am. 2 am they let us on the plane and we wait for an hour. Pilot time has been used up so we have to wait for another pilot. We wait an hour. No pilot. Flight is canceled. I make reservations for a flight out that morning at 5.30. Get my ticket go to the gate. Cancelled. So where's the bag that I checked on the flight. They can't provide any answers. All they seem capable of telling me is that was an act of God and therefore they are not responsible for anything that happened. Yes it's cheap but that's no excuse for treating everyone like cattle. I will never travel on it again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Today was my second time taking Southwest. The 7am flight from LAX to SFO was cancelled for maintenance issues. They did not have a backup plane at LAX to accommodate their passengers. The solution that they came up with was to book all of the passengers on Standby to SFO and OAK. I am now waiting to find out even if we can fly at 9.20am or not. Which can't be answered until 8.50am. This is an unacceptable way to treat customers and I am sure is ruining more than the start of my vacation. This is the time that people book to have a get away for the weekend."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest was my 'go-to' airline for the past 20 years. This past week I took a flight from Denver to Boston a 4-hour flight that left 7 hours late. The last 4 hours was attributed to weather. The first 3 hours of delay were never explained. No responsibility taken by Southwest. No coupons offered. I will never under any circumstance purchase a Southwest flight again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Ever since JetBlue left Tucson International Airport my husband and I have been loyal Southwest customers who fly four times yearly between TUS and LGA. Flights are convenient prices are good there's no charge for baggage service is friendly seats are comfortable and we have experienced rare delays. Interestingly enough the passengers are friendly and helpful to one another despite open seating."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I'm a loyal Southwest flier and recently had an awful experience. While flying from BWI to JAX we were told we were about to start boarding. They boarded all pre-board passengers then shut the door claiming the plane wasn't ready to board. The loaded and unloaded all luggage for what was later explained to us as an ""oil leak"". This whole time the pre-board passengers were still on the plane with no air what-so-ever. After 15-20 minutes they boarded the rest of the passengers. They then told us that the AC wouldn't properly work because the engine was too hot so we all sat cramped in our seats sweating for the two hour flight. No moving air at all. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Today was my first time flying with Southwest Airlines and I must say that I am very disappointed. Our connection flight had to be rescheduled by Southwest and by how they scheduled it we had only 30 minutes to make our next flight which turned into 2 minutes when the initial flight was delayed by the airline. Needless to say we did not make our flight. What should have been a five hour travel day turned into an all day travel day which was very long and tiresome for me especially since I am eight months pregnant. It would have made the experience a lot better if Southwest would have somehow reimbursed us for some of the flight or offered us a discount for future flights since the delays were of no fault of our own. The flight attendants were nice and the people at the ticket counters were overall nice but overall the travel experience was very disappointing. Not a fun way to start our babymoon vacation."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Haven't flown Southwest for quite a while. I am now sitting at the airport in Seattle waiting for my flight to Phoenix the flight has been delayed 3 hrs and they said there are no other flights available. It has been back and forth from a 3 hour delay to a 6 hour delay who knows what time we will actually depart. Doubt I will fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I received an early notice that the flight was going to be delayed one hour. Okay that is not a problem. When I got on the flight one hour later I sat for another additional hour! My flight was delayed over two hours one hour was just spent sitting on the plane. Turns out Southwest overbooked the flight. The flight attendants also had no idea what was going on. While on the plane they made an announcement that if anyone would volunteer to go on a later flight they would get reimbursed and have a free round trip flight. Very disorganized. I had a rehearsal dinner to attend that I made only the last few minutes of. I doubt I will fly Southwest anymore."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","After being delayed 4 hours in Raleigh Durham I caught a flight to Baltimore and on to Kansas City. I sat in an aisle seat next to a large 300+ pound man. Obviously I leaned out into the aisle to accommodate for the gentleman. My feet never were in the aisle but my shoulder was. Throughout the 2.5 hour flight I was bumped progressively harder in my shoulder 8 times by the only female flight attendant on staff. Never once when she was walking towards me from the front. Always a fast paced bump to my shoulder as she walked past me in the other direction. Never once an ""excuse me"" or a turn around to see what she'd just hit. Seemed pretty intentional after the last one before landing in KC. Maybe she would be of more use loading bags somewhere away from others?"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest Airlines has joined the ranks of all other airlines: Poor and unsupporting. Stuck my two sons in St. Louis for 24 hours due to a mechanical in Denver. Routing to Grand Rapids was via Orlando. Watch out for the fact they cannot/do not interline. United and Delta had flights open but the loaner (SWA) wont play with the others. Ended up buying them tickets on American (for less money) to get them home."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LGA to HOU on May 18th. Easy check-in online and baggage drop at the airport. Organized boarding. Clean aircraft. Good legroom and comfy seat. Crew were fabulous offered snacks and drinks. Although we left 20 min late from LGA we arrived at HOU 15 min earlier. Our luggage was delivered shortly afterwards."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I won't fly Southwest anymore. I was a loyal customer for 13 years. I feel this company has lost sight of there core value Customer service. The idea of adding 6 extra seats to there Boeing 737 configuration is a travesty. The loss of comfort and leg room just to pick up a few extra bucks. My luggage was lost on my last trip from SMF-PDX I was told by the customer service representative that my lost bag (golf clubs) could would not be delivered to Bend OR where I was staying. The new policy of SWA does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. So I can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it Fed Ex 2-3 business days. That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. I thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. So now SWA will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight. But if you don't show up for the flight they have no problem taking your money with no refund or accommodation."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My last 4 flights out of Nashville have been delayed anyway from 45 minutes to 3 hours. I am a student and I like flying Southwest because of the flight change policy and 2 free bags. However going forward I may change my airline from Nashville to Boston. I would rather have a layover on-time then a 3 hour delay every time I fly."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I am thinking of taking a different airline for my future travels. The major reason I had chosen Southwest was the 2 free checked bags but on this last trip there was more damage to the contents of the bags then a fee would have cost me. Since I am pregnant and was tired after my flight I did not check my second bag until the next day and that is when I found the broken items. The bag did not seem damaged and the items where wrapped in towels and other clothes. Customer service said they could not do anything about it though since I did not report it within four hours. So if you choose to use them in the future check your luggage right away."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Had the worst flight ever from South West. We were stuck on the plane from 9am - 7pm PST with no food. My husband 18 month old baby and I were supposed to fly from Raleigh to Portland Oregon. We noted our layovers in Houston and Kansas City and planned on getting food during the stops. When our first flight landed in Houston we were asked at stay in our seats as they would start boarding the next flight. Same thing happened in Kansas City. There was no optional food we could purchase. We were stuck trying to find whatever we could in the diaper bag to feed our little girl. We had also planned on purchasing WiFi to have our daughter watch Netflix which was also unavailable. Insult to injury the last leg of the flight when I went to change my daughter's diaper the sink in the rear bathroom was clogged and the trash was overflowing. I have tried to email Southwest Airlines in hopes to know my complaints were heard and no response. I have also tried Twitter on multiple occasions."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Something seems to have changed at Southwest. For many years SW was the only airline we wanted to fly because: on-time schedules nice staff/crew all around good operation. Recently (week of May 8-15 '14) my family experienced sub quality performance from SW (flights from Dallas and Albuquerque to Orlando and back). Schedules were way off hours late with inaccurate updates that basically said ""we'll fly when we fly"" (weather plays into this but weather has always been an issue and procedures to deal with it efficiently as in giving accurate information should be in place. Flying out of Orlando was a total fiasco. The flight schedule boards and the gate desk showed ""on-time"" departures when in fact the departure time had already passed. Travelers were asking each other for updates from the internet. Finally the flight number completely disappeared from all boards (the SW rep at the gate said after an hour flights are dropped and that he couldn't say when the flight would take off). So 3.5 hours later our plane takes off. Connecting flights of course didn't happen because our flights were at the end of the day. In Phoenix around midnight we were dumped with no customer service desk open to help those who missed their connections to re-schedule. We were lucky enough to find one ticket rep (Homero) who was trying to go home but did help single handedly even though the counter was closed and many people were needing assistance. SW offered no vouchers for future travel and we had to find our own accommodations for the night-the info handout with a number to call for a nearby hotel recommendation with discount had little to offer with no pick-up available. My conclusion is that perhaps SW has gotten too big (with Airtran acquisition) and has lost control of some operations. SW is at its best as a short haul regional airline. Cross country flights (3 hours +) are off schedule and uncomfortable. The good news is that the staff and crew we encountered tried to be helpful but they are powerless when they don't have the information and support that they need."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have flown Southwest several times. This is my first time to write a review. We flew from Little Rock to Las Vegas. On the way back we were late to board and missed the flight. They put our luggage on another plane and couldn't guarantee when they would get to Little Rock. They put us on a flight to Chicago a little later every seat was full so we were lucky to get on. From Chicago we got a plane to Little Rock again the seats were full so we were lucky again. We were about five hours or so later than if we hadn't missed our original flight. All I can say the Southwest people were very nice about trying to help make the connections and when we got to Little Rock our luggage came in about forty-five minutes later. All I can say about Southwest is good. The flight attendants were very nice too all of them. When we came into Las Vegas the plane went over the Hoover Dam with a very good view I made a comment about the view when I got off and told the pilot I was hoping for a circle around the dam he told me they frowned on that since it would take about another thousand bucks. A little humor thrown in. When I fly it will be with Southwest I have never had any trouble."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","This is the first and last time I will fly Southwest. Our flight was delayed from L.A. to Chicago and our connecting flight was also delayed. The connection left an hour earlier than the listed time on the website. The next available flight was 17hrs later. The customer service agents were rude condescending and were of no help at all. We rented a car to drive 12 hours home but not before waiting 4 hours for our luggage. This service is shameful. I will never fly Southwest again and I would never recommend this airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I will never fly this Airline again. Flight 37 was to take off at 4.50pm from Houston to Atlanta and due to weather conditions it was delayed which was understandable. However we were never updated on the flight we kept being told that the flight was in route when it apparently wasn't and finally after 5 hours the plane arrived from Dallas - a 1 hour flight. Then we were told after it arrived that the Pilot had timed out and couldn't fly anymore. Just lies and more lies and finally a Supervisor informed us that another flight was supposed to arrive at 12.10 am and at this point we are still waiting. There was no accurate information disseminated at no time! I understand that things happen but accurate communication is essential but this was totally ridiculous and unacceptable!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flight 490 Tampa to Albany NY. April 30 2014. Love the free two bags at check-in. Hate the 737-700 seats. I'm 6' 2"" 230 lbs. there is no way I can sit and be comfortable. Those seats are ridiculous."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","This was the first and last time I plan to fly with Southwest/Transair. The plane was dirty and noisy. The staff were not pleasant and spent most of their time talking. The internet was so weak the my husband could not watch the show he wanted to without it stalling every few minutes and he could only get the dialogue with a frozen screen. It was a waste of ten dollars for a service that did not work. I am only 5 feet 2 but I could not even get my legs comfortable. There was not choice for a snack and not everyone likes or can have pretzels on their diet. When we exited the plane only one staff member was anywhere near the door but she was not greeting passengers she was cleaning up the food area. I said goodbye and she barely looked up. The pilot did not say two words to us during the flight about where we were until we were about to land. The only good part of the whole experience was the time of day was convenient but I can find that with any airline. I will definitely be going back to the airline I have been using for decades. That way I know what I will be getting for my money. Sorry but this one bad flight put a sour taste in my mouth and wallet."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Not very impressed. It's been my third time the flight has been delayed and I got a 15 minute heads up of course that update was completely useless as I was already being reassigned planes. Taking into consideration that nothing can be done about poor weather the boarding process is awful and the representatives at the Fort Lauderdale front desk seemed very inconvenienced that they had to re-book us. It would really have made a difference if some genuine expression was portrayed."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","March 30th 2014. Hartford Ct. to Las Vegas. While waiting to board the flight I noticed a very angry looking male flight attendant wandering around the gate area he was on our flight and his mood didn't improve for the entire 5.5 hour flight. During a short period of relatively smooth air the crew started taking drink orders. Fortunately on the way home the crew were very pleasant with passengers. The plane was a 737-700 fairly comfortable and the free snacks were a nice surprise."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I think the boarding process with un-assigned seats is outdated and treats folks like cattle. You have no clue if you will be sitting with the person you are traveling with. On the first flight I had a great seating number had to be re-routed due to plane problems and was near-last on the re-routed flight. Sat in the middle seat (without my travel partner) for four hours. On the way back I checked in 20 hours in advance and was the very last person boarding. How is it that I can check in that early and every single person be seated ahead of me? Again sat in the middle and without my travel partner. The upgrade offer is nothing more than a bribe. I won't fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew St. Louis to Orlando and return. Online check in was very easy and I got an ""A"" boarding cards both times checking in 24 hours ahead of time. Planes left and arrived on time. FAs were in a good mood and very friendly. Soft drinks and pretzels and peanuts were served. Luggage was free and arrived quickly."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Sitting in SFO waiting for my surprise surprise delayed Southwest flight to Orange County. When I called them this morning to see what the delay was the agent said ""It''s SFO they're always backed up"". Funny thing is I'm here sitting with my sister who has a flight to LAX on time on Virgin airlines not to mention no delays on any of Virgin's flight out of SFO. Sure Southwest is cheaper but if you want to get some where on time or you would prefer not to spend your free time hanging out at an airport don't use Southwest. My flight here was delayed as well. In fact I don't recall an on-time flight with Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I had my two minor sons fly from my mom's in OAK to LAX. When they arrived at the airport my mother went about getting them checked in. They were treated as if they were 18 and 25! They were not boarded separately note were they seated by flight attendants. The attendants only offered he usual snack and drink and when they deplaned they were sent off of the plane into LAX terminal unaccompanied! When I asked about the policy we were told that since our 13 year old was over the age of 11 he was responsible for our six year old traveling with him. This is a cash cow low class airline which I will never allow my kids to travel on again! Southwest flight 950 from Oakland to Los Angeles on Friday April 18 2014."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","BUF-MCO-BUF. The unassigned seating is such a pain because then you have flight attendants yelling at you to choose any available seat. Both flights were on a Boeing 737-300. Cramped seating but flight attendants were polite and nice once you were in the air. In-flight magazine is terrible but the free snacks ands drinks helped. Although Southwest does have some of the best baggage policies in all of North America."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","EWR-HOU-EWR. I flew on an early flight to Houston Hobby. The flight was extremely empty and there was a ton of seats. I got A23 and A24 for that flight. Staff were quite attentive and provided us with snacks and drinks. We got into Houston around the time we should get there. Our return flight was delayed 90 minutes and we got a different plane. There were also delays at EWR so I just had to deal with it. The staff was just as attentive. Once we landed one of the flight attendants did apologize for the delay. Although I did not check any bags they got off the plane extremely quickly. I would fly them again!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Return trip from Denver change in Baltimore than land in Islip NY landing at 8.45pm. I did not know that the first leg of the trip was stopping in Louisville but I learned that a ""direct"" flight does not mean non-stop. Louisville to Baltimore was canceled and I was the only passenger that they let on all others were stopped and told about the situation. There was no announcement about the cancellation so when we landed in Louisville I asked the flight attendant and she sent me to the gate attendant who put me on a flight to Chicago then to LaGuardia airport landing at 12.00am. Told my luggage was left on the plane that was going to Orlando. Turns out my luggage didn't go to Orlando and was taken off in Louisville. It eventually made its way to Islip the next day. Because of the late arrival and distance from home I was forced to get a car service at a cost of $120."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have avoided using Southwest in the past as I don't like lines pushing and shoving or unassigned seating. Nonetheless after hearing about SWA's Business Select Class I decided to give them a try. For about $60 more than the walk-up fare Business Select guarantees the passenger a boarding pass in the A1-A15 group thus being among the first to board. I was thrilled when I checked in online and received boarding pass A-1. The gate room seemed fairly empty and Southwest agents were hawking upgrades for $40 to anyone wanting to move up in the short boarding line. Upon boarding the aircraft I discovered that there were already 90 through passengers already on the airplane. Little overhead space available and mostly middle seats. Although the staff was affable and tried their best I found this to be an extremely uncomfortable way to travel and recommend strongly against wasting money for Business Select."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","The airline is fine as far as on time baggage goes through quickly staff are friendly and helpful. However the boarding procedure (no assigned seats) is just a way to charge people for a reasonable line placement. So when considering flying SW with a family that would like sitting together add from 15 to 40 dollars to the price of a ticket and purchase the upgrade. All and all a fine airline for those flying alone but not family friendly."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest 1696 on April 1st from Baltimore to Denver. By using the rapid rewards debit card we got throughout the year we are able to take a vacation for no more than $30 each year ($30 is tax). We always check in on the dot of 24 hours before departure and usually get A or B boarding groups. We love that we get to choose our own seat. The staff are always very friendly and the new free TV on board every flight is my 2 kids favorite past time."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I was horrified by the policy of changing flights at SouthWest. I had a round trip ticket and was able to return home earlier so arrived at Nashville airport 11.30 looking to get on the almost empty 1.20 pm flight. I was informed that I would have to pay $250 to purchase a new ONE WAY ticket home. I paid less than that for the round-trip flight. I did not expect this since I was told that SW was customer friendly and did not charge change fees. No they just charge you for a whole new ticket instead. I am trapped in Nashville for the next 8.5 hours thanks to their policy."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Having flown 45 weeks or so annually and now scaling back I fly Southwest for both business and pleasure. Southwest is an easy transition. With all the cutbacks and cattle calls that airlines have migrated to SW at least makes it simple ABC. If you can't figure that out sit in the middle. Their gate attendants are knowledgeable take the same stupid questions over and over yet answer them in a polite manner."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My husband and I will avoid Southwest/AirTran at all costs. Vacation to Cabo 3/1/14 with connections in Denver. 1 hour late getting off ground in Milwaukee as plane was over weight and they had to kick 8 people off. Late arrival in Denver forced mad rush to gate in different terminal for connection to Cabo. Returning to Milwaukee 3/10/14 plane was 1 hour late getting in and leaving Cabo which again created havoc in Denver for connection back to Milwaukee. The absolute kicker is they lost both of our bags going to Cabo (30 hours before returned) and returning to Milwaukee (36 hours before returned). Unbelievable incompetence. Your bags fly free - you just don't know where!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Las Vegas to Richmond VA. Booked with AirTran but transported by Southwest from LAS to ATL. Biggest problem I have with Southwest is no seat assignment. That's why I picked AirTran. With Southwest I feel like I'm treated like cattle and herded through the process of boarding the plane. I believe AirTran has the right approach for boarding. That is 1) assigned seats and 2) boarding by zones. I can't understand why the general flying public tolerates Southwest's cattle call boarding. Southwest's prices are right but their anywhere you want seating is for the birds."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Vacation to Cabo San Lucas Mexico scheduled 3/1/14. Boarded in Milwaukee with a connection in Denver. When we arrived at check in we were told the flight had been 'overbooked' by 5 passengers. We received the last 2 boarding passes luckily. Upon being seated and waiting for 15 minutes the flight attendant announced that the plane was over-weight and 8 passengers would have to leave. It took another 30 minutes to adjust the weight before we took off - 1 hour after schedule. Upon arriving in Denver an hour late we had to rush to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Cabo. Flight to Cabo went on schedule until standing at the luggage carousel our 2 pieces of checked luggage never came out. It was not until 30 hours later that our luggage finally showed up. On our return when we checked in at the airport it was announced that our plane was delayed an hour. Taking off to Denver again we realized we were facing a potential connect issue again. Once entering the U.S. we needed to go through customs in Denver before boarding our flight to Milwaukee. Once through customs you need to claim your luggage and then recheck it with Southwest/AirTran. We then had to pass through security before racing to another terminal where our gate was located because of late arrival. We boarded the plane and left for Milwaukee arriving at 10pm on-time. We then went to retrieve our luggage and once again our two bags never showed up. It took another 36 hours to get our bags delivered to our home."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew from Nashville-Houston-Dallas last Tuesday. As usual so many people have to bring their suitcases on board with them these days that we leave late. We get to Houston and our connection flight is down they finally get it fixed and we leave out almost an hour late getting into Dallas only to hear they don't know where our luggage is. We later find out that the plane had a lot of freight so they made us wait an hour for our luggage. I live 8 hours (by car) from Dallas and 2 hours from Nashville. Had I driven to Dallas I would have arrived at my hotel 2 hours before I actually got there by flying. On the return trip our flight from Dallas to St. Louis was late and I had to run to my connecting flight to get there before the door was closing. I think this airline is slipping so I intend to start looking at others after always using Southwest without checking."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flown from Houston to Las Vegas last week. Everything was good (except lots of passengers were drunk and yelling). Our flight departed on time and arrived 15 min prior to schedule. I had no complaints at all for the price it was a fair trip. The return flight was delayed 40 min. Whoever is surprised by this obviously doesn't travel a lot by plane. I say for the price their flights are good don't expect feeling as royalty of course. For short trips (4 hours max.) it's pretty enjoyable."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Feb 2014 - BUF-FLL (return). We booked Southwest mainly because of the price and I was a little apprehensive about avoiding the dreaded middle and getting a decent aisle seat. We paid an extra fee for their ""early bird"" check in which in our case allowed us to board with the first 25 passengers both outbound and return. It was a 3 hour flight and that's about all of the time I would want to spend in their cramped uncomfortable seating. But for a reasonable short flight I'd book Southwest again. It's a basic no frills airline with no baggage fees and it gets you there albeit not in the most comfortable circumstances."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","15 minutes before scheduled takeoff gate announces delay. 45 minutes later gate announces mechanical problems and further delays. All passenger were being re-routed. 3 hours later flight is canceled and they offer to get me home tomorrow with no compensation for delay. Its as if they said ""if our planes fly we will take you if not too bad there are no guarantees"". Finally when I asked to be booked on tomorrow's flight until I could see if I could buy a ticket on another airline I was told ""if we do we can not refund any of your money because we will have solved your problem""."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Our flight was 20 minutes late taking off because there was a previous flight still at the gate. As soon as the last person walked off the passengers in wheelchairs were boarded so obviously there was no time to clean the plane. The washroom was very dirty. Yesterday at 6.15 flight 1957 Ft. Myers to Chicago. Southwest was trying to keep on schedule but please clean the plane."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Feb 8th flight 2178 Orange County to San Francisco. Feb 5th flight 2962 Denver to Orange County. I travel quite frequently. I rarely have to check any bags but I like having the option to do so for free if I need to. I travel twice/week for the last 2 months and I have never encountered an unpleasant flight attendant in fact I find them more than amusing. Also as someone who has flight anxiety I feel so secure when flying Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I recently flew round trip from Austin to Sacramento. The boarding process went smooth no delays but the flight was very uneventful. The pilot was completely silent the entire flight the flight attendant rude and very cramped seats. The return flight home was overbooked and at 100%. However the pilot and attendants were very pleasant and had a great sense of humor. I would advise that you fill up on food before you fly as there is no meal service just peanuts pretzels and mini Ritz sandwich crackers. It would be nice though if the pilot would make an announcement once in a while regarding your eta."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We signed up for flight notifications with an email address. We were told at the airport that we had been notified at 11.45 that our flight was cancelled. We had not been notified and neither had anyone else in line around us. Had we been notified we would have known not to leave for our 3 pm flight and not to waste 3 hours going to the airport and standing in line to change our flight. Why were there only 3 customer service people handling the hundreds of people standing in line? Southwest used to be the ""go to"" airline. No longer. What a disappointment. The customer service rep was polite but really could not have cared less."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I fly SW from San Jose to Ft Lauderdale and back several times a year. I too have been a victim of delays due to mechanical problems and sometimes bad weather. I suspect that all airlines have these issues. I love the witty banter of the safety announcements. If you are nice to the staff they will be nice to you. It is not their job to stuff your 90 lb. carry on into the overhead bin. The pilot decides when and if beverages and snacks will be served. I am a ""senior"" and remember the old days when people didn't feel so entitled as they board in their sweat pants or worse. It takes just one or two passengers to ruin a flight."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","San Antonio - Las Vegas via Denver and Las Vegas - San Antonio in January. On a business class RTW ticket we did this low frills side trip with UK and US friends - they're buses with prices to match check-in at the 24 hour point gets you into the early second tier boarding queue which enabled our party of six to all travel next to their partner and all couples had one window seat with carry on in the over head lockers and all flights were full. They took their own lunch and appreciate the gratis soft drinks/coffee and unlimited pretzels. Loved the commentary from the flight deck on departure from Las Vegas and on arrival at San Antonio. For internal US travel go for it."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I took this airline from Houston to Orlando and while the flight was smooth I don't really like the seat arrangements. You are assigned a group so if you get a bad group then you can get on the plane with your spouse and not be able to sit together because of no available two seats together."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","12 Jan flight 670 MDW-LGA 1.5 hrs. Low fare easy check in speedy boarding on-time professional cabin crew very good seat pitch new aircraft. Soft drinks nuts and pretzels - free of charge. Better than other ""traditional"" airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Traveled on WN1038 25 Dec San Antonio to Orlando non-stop as a separate domestic segment making up a One World American Airlines KUL-CDG-DFW-SAT/PBI-ORD-LHR-KUL. It was a full flight to a holiday destination at the busiest time of the year. Service was the absolute minimal. Sodas were minimal with just one cup and no top-ups! Legacy carriers would offer the whole can of Dr Pepper for you to enjoy your drink. Southwest of today is definitely not the Southwest of the 80s! If you need a 2nd piece of check in bag then you might want to consider Southwest otherwise stay away."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Admittedly there was a storm two days before we wanted to arrive in our destination of Indianapolis. They repeatedly lied to us and told us that the Indianapolis airport was closed when there were other airlines flying into Indianapolis from the same airport. They changed our flight 10 times. After they cancelled our flight to Indy they put us on another flight to Louisville airport after we received this confirmation the flight was reinstated but we lost our spot. They never gave us meal vouchers or paid for a hotel. They refused to get us a ticket with any other airline actually flying into Indianapolis too. All in all the worst experience I have eve had with any company."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Just returned from a trip to San Jose the 1st. of January. I do not like this cattle call method of filling the seats. After finally entering plane I always look for the seats by the emergency exit due to knee problems what I found was a young girl sitting there already. When I brought my concern to the stewardess about whether or not she would be capable of opening the emergency exit she just said no problem for her to open it. The seats are not made for me and I find them very uncomfortable. I really would like to give SouthWest airlines a better score but could not."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flight 3546 Denver to Philadelphia 1/3/14. The weather was bad in Philadelphia so all flights were problematic - but SW changed the departure time over 8 times there were 5 gate changes. All we were told with all this the flight arrived 5.5 hours late in Philadelphia and the bags took another 45 minutes."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew from Detroit on Jan 4 2013 flight 2112 to Las Vegas with my 10 year old son who is autistic and has glaucoma. Flight was delayed 2 hours while we waited for a 3rd flight attendant. The gentleman taking tickets was making jokes and doing a comedy routine once we finally got on board his parting shot was ""sorry for the delay hope you had as much fun as we did"". When we landed the flight attendants got on the PA and said ""finally"" like the passengers were responsible for the delay. Missed our connection to Burbank that flight was delayed as well but they apparently could not wait another 20 minutes or so to get the rest of the passengers on. I told the agent I'm flexible and can fly into any airport in Southern California. She seemed to be put out at having to help any of us. Their solution was to basically throw their hands in the air and put us all on standby. The did offer lodging though. Thankfully I spoke with a different agent and she was able to get us to Orange County. Have never seen a more unprofessional airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew in Sept. 2013 from Nashville to Denver and later Denver to LAX. We were very impressed considering this is a budget airline. Managed to get seats in the 2nd row on both flights for both myself and my elderly mother. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive nice smooth flights new planes very clean. Were most impressed with ground crews in both Denver and LA who allowed my mother and I to board the plane before any general boarding. Will certainly fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We flew from Minneapolis to Houston on December 14. We had weather delays so had to fly to Milwaukee / St Louis / Oklahoma City and finally into Houston Hobby in the evening. It was a hectic flight but the crew on flight 3480 were wonderful!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Dec 22 - Flt 3308 BDL to Midway and on to LAX. Dec 27 - Flt 774 to Midway Flt 1821 to BDL. Southwest's new seating to increase its profits makes it one of the most uncomfortable airlines I have flown on. They have squeezed two extra rows into a 737 to increase profits at the cost of customer comfort. I am 6'2"" and had my knees crammed against the seat in front of me. SW did offer an ""upgrade"" at check in - access to rows A 1-15 - but that would have cost my wife and me an extra $500! In addition to lack of leg room the new seats barely come to mid- thigh further increasing my discomfort. The touted benefits of no baggage fee (one bag apiece) and friendly staff are no compensation for hours of discomfort."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX-SFO return on 12/09/2013. I like the text message updates early in the day that let you know flights may be late. Before I even left LAX I knew my flight home from SFO would be over 1.5 hours late. That allowed me to finish up early and get back to the airport to try and catch the earlier flight. I did just that and was accommodated on the second to last flight back to LAX. Even though I used points for this trip there was no charge to take the earlier flight. Flights always have drink service and a choice of peanuts/pretzels. Even though they can be stingy when passing the snacks out they never say no when you ask for more and are always nice and polite. In addition I always ask for a kids book with wings to take home for my kid and they gave me two this time - nice touch. So while the assigned seating thing can be a drag they make up for it with outstanding service. And while I was given B51 on the earlier flight to LAX I still managed to get a window sea t so no complaints on the seating. Checking in early is key!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have been on several airlines in my life but Southwest Airlines in my opinion is the worst. The open seating is like a mad zoo. No control people pushing it is the worse possible way I have ever seen to board a plane. Additionally the seats are the smallest and most cramped I've been in. No leg room and a totally miserable experience. I will not fly with them anymore. They have lost me as a customer. However the flight crew is friendly."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have been a Southwest customer for years and have rarely had problems. Today I was trying to get home for Thanksgiving. I have signed up to get text messages about the status of my flights and until today this has worked out fine. Until today I have received text messages informing me of flight delays which turned out to be accurate. Today I received 2 successive texts telling me that my flight was being delayed first from the original departure time of 5.25pm until 6.00pm and then of a further delay until 6.20pm. When I arrived at my gate about one hour before the scheduled departure time there was no seating available in the area of the gate from which my flight was leaving. I moved to an area of the concourse where the gates are not currently being used so I could sit and elevate my feet. I was actually sitting there when the second text came telling me of the delay until 6.20pm. At 6.10 I got up and walked down to my gate. When I arrived I discovered that the plane had actually departed at 5.50 before I received the second text. When I spoke with the person at the Customer Service desk I was told that I should not have left the gate and that the announcement that the plane was actually leaving at the originally scheduled time could not be heard in the area where I had been sitting. When I asked why I had received a second text message telling me of a further delay after the flight had actually left I was told that the texts are computer generated and are for my convenience only. I was aware that the plane might actually depart later than the time given in the text message but it had never occurred to me that it might depart earlier than the time predicted by the texts. I was told that my options were to wait for ten next flight which was due in about two hours fly to Baltimore for a layover then fly to Nashville and arrive at my destination a little before mid-night or pay for a hotel room and take a flight in the morning. I could not face several more hours of great discomfort so I am spending tonight in the Microtel without luggage or medication."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Great customer service! After being messed around by United once again where they left me stranded in St Louis I booked a flight at the airport to Philly (though I really wanted to go to Newark where United was supposed to take me). As I went to the gate for my flight leaving 45 minutes after I booked it I saw the flight to Newark that was supposed to depart 10 minutes before I arrived at the airport had been delayed and was now leaving in 5 minutes. Went to gate agent explained I was screwed by United and really wanted to go to Newark he said ""No problem"" switched me to the Newark flight and handed me the ticket. When I asked how much he said ""No charge have a nice flight""."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Delayed 4 hours each way from Philadelphia to California. No explanation whatsoever. They put me on a different flight and my luggage on the original flight and then lost my luggage! I would rather walk than take Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I fly with Southwest Airlines frequently. In fact I hardly ever fly with any other US carrier. This does not mean that I love the airline merely that by US standards it is not bad. Some flights go well and the crew are a lot of fun. This was especially the case on both flights I took on 28 October from San Francisco to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Minneapolis. The crew were friendly told jokes and made me feel almost refreshed despite having a long Osaka-Hong Kong-San Francisco flight the day before. At times the flights either leave much to be desired or can be almost horrific as was the case on both flights I took with them on the 7th of October -- Minneapolis to Phoenix Phoenix to San Francisco. Surly crews with terrible service. Those two flights drained me more than the flight to Hong Kong despite having less than half the travelling time combined. Most flights are fairly pleasant if unremarkable. Despite the hits and misses I will likely continue flying with Southwest Airlines because they do not charge as many fees and generally speaking do their job with greater efficiency than any other domestic US carrier."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flight 3246 from Chicago Midway to Columbus Ohio on 11/4/13. They used to be the cheapest: no longer. They used to have the best service: now they are going to start charging for bags. They used to be on time: I'm sitting 3 hours late in an airport for the 6th time in 4 months!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew 10/24 flt 440 FLL to PVD. We actually arrived early! Everyone from baggage check to flight attendants to flight crew were extremely nice. Same way on the trip home on 10/28 flight 3761. Both planes were full but it was organized and ran smoothly. Excellent value (free baggage etc). I would take Southwest again just based on the employee attitudes."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I am so disappointed. I used to rave about Southwest but things have taken a turn for the worse! First flight out at 7am and the plane had 'mechanical issues' so we were delayed. We missed our connecting flight. As we were deplaning the flight staff informed us that they held the Southwest connection for those 31 passengers going to Las Vegas however since there were only 19 of us headed to LAX we had to be rebooked. They proceeded to take us to Fort Lauderdale with an ensuing 7 hour layover and then a delay on the tarmac for another hour! I think the worst part was not once did any Southwest employee acknowledge our inconvenience."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Took flight 2009 from Las Vegas 10/33/2013. Told flight was delayed 30 minutes ended up being over an hour and a half. We were waiting on luggage to arrive from another flight. There were approx. 15-20 people trying to make connections in Austin and they were holding the plane for luggage. Usually great flights not this one. Will have to think twice before flying SW again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My husband for the first time booked three flights with Southwest. We flew from Orlando to New Orleans from New Orleans to Dallas then from Dallas back to Orlando. We were very pleased with the service and we agreed that every seat on a Southwest flight IS compatible to flying first class with any other carrier. They all should take note IJS. You must remember to print your boarding pass 24 hours prior to your flight departure this will determine your boarding zone. The check in was so smooth! No need to fly with any other carrier."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Yesterday 10/6/2013 my husband and I traveled on flight #320 from Phoenix to SF and although the trip was smooth and uneventful we were disappointed that throughout the entire flight (except the last few minutes for landing) the lights in the cabin were dimmed a bit but were never turned completely off. I can only speak for the two of us but I found it very annoying and not relaxing at all. It turned our two hour flight (that I was looking forward to closing my eyes and relaxing) to one in which I was looking at my watch frequently anxious for the flight to end. Disappointing for sure!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew Southwest today for the first time. Flight 905 LGA to Chicago Midway. Easy check in online pre-queue at the airport. Seats are comfortable with decent legroom clean and new aircraft professional cabin crew. Left 5 min late due ramp congestion but arrived in Midway 20 min earlier. Will fly with them again and certainly would recommend."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Birmingham AL to Orlando FL on Oct. 2 2013. Flight number 243. Southwest has fallen into the cattle service crowd. Not only nothing special here their cute casual personality now falls short and is boring. Non service oriented on the plane and even worse in re-shuffling flight schedules for maximum load making paying customers wait in airports because their original flight get canceled. A value no longer all the best I'm flying with someone who cares about my loyalty."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Three recent trips on Southwest (AUS-DEN DEN-SMF SFO-PHX). All three were delayed with times ranging from an acceptable 20 mins to a nail biting 75 mins delay which meant we almost missed our connecting flight. Gate agents were all friendly and kept us informed. On board was a different matter with rarely a smile from the flight attendants. Southwest used to be so different from the competition but I don't think this is the case anymore. Free checked bags is certainly an advantage though."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","This was our first time with Southwest round-trip from DEN-LAX both flights left and arrived on time. There were no problems or delays with boarding. Check-in and baggage check-in very efficient. This was wonderful considering that we have often flown United USAir American Delta and not once did the plane leave on time and had problems with loading. The crew were polite and courteous unlike those other US airlines we have flown."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I recently flew to New York City and my airport was LaGuardia. The flight to New York was fine and went without a problem. However my return flight home where I was on a time crunch was quite different. I recognize that the delay in getting home was due to lighting strikes in the area not an organizational management issue of SW and for safety considerations all flights in and out of LaGuardia were delayed. The terminal at LaGuardia is far too small to accommodate the business for Southwest especially when an unforeseen event occurs as in this case. SW had one Customer Care representative trying to handle a large number of passengers. Finally another representative showed up. Then appeared a supervisor who decided to make an issue with his subordinate about how long his break was to be I have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior at an airline counter as this. It was unbearable in that worn out terminal - nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor in walkways and exit ways. I stood in- line again just to be given misinformation from that same supervisor/manager that there would no problem. After 5.5 hours in that crowed musty terminal I went out of security back down to the check-in counter where I found a representative who was helpful. I don't think I will take SW to New York especially via LaGuardia ever again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SFO-LAS. First time flying Southwest! The crew were hilarious. Great quick flight - left and arrived on time boarding was quick and efficient and the baggage arrived quickly. Loved this airline and would happily fly them as my carrier of choice for my next trip to America."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","From Vegas back to San Francisco. In Group B I was one of the first people to board the plane. When I heard my group being called I stood in line in the right number section that was written on my boarding pass. Following the people in line in front of me I presented my boarding pass to the attendant and she responded in such a rude way I never want to fly Southwest again. As I presented my boarding pass without eye contact she handed it back to me. Instead of placing it back in my hand she practically tossed it to me landing on the ground. She instead grumbled this isn't your group. Please wait to board when I call your group. Confused I replied is this group B?” She stared at the pass for a while and responded “Oh I thought I called the wrong group!” And finally let me board. This frustrated me as the attendant didn't make eye contact with me the whole time we were talking. The captain and crew members were unprofessional and laughed many times over the main speaker when making announcements. My flight was on Sunday around 10.30am departing from Vegas. Not such a great way to end my vacation."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I'm Executive Platinum with AA and as we live in Austin AA is usually our carrier of choice. Recent trip to LAS we booked Southwest for the non-stops on this round trip. Never been on Southwest before and I was sure they were not going to match AA. Paid for Early Boarding and received low A group boarding on both flights. Their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in I've experienced. I don't mind paying baggage fees when I have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change. Boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line. The planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great. Standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip. Very fast boarding they may be on to something here. Fast on board service without carts in the aisle. Overall a very nice trip and would easily use Southwest again for certain trips out of Austin. They do serve a niche."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Had the displeasure of flying Flight 2878 (9/2/2013) last night from Dallas to St. Louis. Flight was supposed to depart at 7.05pm but we were in the plane on the ground at 7.25pm when I got a voice mail message from Southwest Airlines to tell me that the flight would leave at 7.25pm. Flight taxied out at 7.35pm and got in position to take off when the flight crew declared a ""Medical Emergency"" and returned to the terminal where we sat until 8.05pm. Finally took off and landed in St. Louis at 9.30pm - 50 minutes late. Sunday night flights to St. Louis are repeatedly late."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Our first and last time using Southwest. We flew from New York (LGA) to Chicago (MDW) over the Labor Day weekend. Outbound trip was ok but the return was chaotic. Our return flight was scheduled for an 8pm departure but was delayed to 11pm due to some weather issues which we can understand. However they kept changing the departure status from 11pm to 10.30pm to 9.10pm and then to 9.45pm. When they changed it to 9.10pm this was when we had to scramble to the airport. We managed to make it to Midway but we were scattered on the plane even when we had Boarding group A. Either way it is best to avoid Southwest Airlines at all costs."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Horrible experience coming home from Disneyworld in Orlando on Saturday August 31. The Southwest flight from Orlando to Chicago missed the connecting flight to Philadelphia by about 10 minutes. We were put on standby for the next flight to Philadelphia 4 hours later but they did not have 4 tickets for my family for that flight (but they sent our checked-in luggage back to Philadelphia on that flight). We were then told at the MDW Southwest desk that there was no flight to Philadelphia for another 3 days but that Southwest was not offering us any overnight lodging or meal vouchers. We were incredulous. At least a dozen other Philadelphians were stranded. We finally took city transit to Union Station and grabbed an Amtrak to NYC then were back home in Philadelphia Sunday night."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have traveled Southwest for years. Always good service and friendly flight attendants. Recently I flew from Omaha to Las Vegas. I arrived at McCarran Airport at approximately 12.10pm. I had to get to my shuttle location by 12.30pm otherwise I would have to wait until 2pm to catch the next shuttle. I didn't think that there was anyway I could catch the 12.30pm shuttle because of the time to get the baggage off the plane. To my complete amazement the luggage arrived very quickly and I was able to get to the shuttle that left at 12.30pm."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I've flown 12 separate flights on Southwest over the last 5 months and I have always found the flights to be pleasant. The line-up seating encourages passengers to interact and the crew have always been friendly and helpful. The on-board wi-fi for $8/day was well worth the expense and can be off-set by the fact that there is no charge for up to two 50 lb bags! Granted there is no 5-star service but Southwest provides an enjoyable experience for a great price."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Another pleasant set of flights on Southwest. BUF-LAS 737-700 LAS-BUF 737-800 (Sky interior with larger overhead bins). Got the seats with double leg room on both flights even with an A30/A37 boarding number. Glad I paid for Early-bird check-in. ($12.50 US each way). Bag drop a bit slow in BUF - can't understand why they don't have a dedicated bag drop line. All flights on time. Drink/snack service on all legs with an additional water service on the longer legs. Luggage delivered quickly at LAS and BUF. Already planning my next trip on Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Definitely not for families as you will have to be seated separately throughout the plane. The initial airfare is low until you pay the extra fees for earlier check-in times so you get a chance to sit together. I checked in 2 hours early sat in the back seat where the cabin narrows very uncomfortable and my family was spread throughout the plane. To my surprise flight attendants got up after sitting in passenger allocated seating after everyone had boarded and joked about empty seats! This airline is a nightmare! However if you are traveling alone and can check in at least a week early and are comfortable with pushing shoving and being rude then maybe this airline is for you."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","OAK - HOU round trip 73Fs both ways and I was in Seat 5F going and 4F on the return. Evolve Interior not bad and my only complaint is a lack of power ports. Cute cookies. Staff not at all bad. Only real complaint was that outbound flight was delayed but they made up for the delay in the air so even though I literally ran through HOU I did pick up my rental car before they closed for the day."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","They did not hold my plane for my connecting flight. I asked the flight attendant to whisk me to the front of the plane so I could make a run for it and he said ""they'll hold the plane for you. I've worked here for 25 years and we've never just left someone behind."" Well after waiting for 100 people to deplane I made a run for it and got to the gate just as the plane was pulling away."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Had a flight from MD to FL the most unorganized flight I have ever been on. It is as if they have never had a flight before! Yes it was that bad! I have been using this company for years and after this experience I will never use them again! It was simply chaos. Avoid at all cost!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","August 2013 DEN-OMA-DEN. Travelled to Omaha for business trip. Plane about 80% full both flights. First time in a long time-actually can't remember when-both flights arrived on time. FAs very pleasant and helpful really nothing to criticize; would recommend based on punctuality alone."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX-DEN-MKE-LAX. All flights worked a treat except a delay out of Denver due to fog of all things - and Denver sits at 5000 feet! Paid for early check-in and was in low A group every time. Once you understand their system and its quite logical SW is a great airline to fly with."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","HOU-LGA-HOU on 737-300 both ways. Boarding was chaotic; cattle herding people onto the plane was very unusual and not efficient. Seats and aircraft were outdated. Seats were very uncomfortable and gave me little legroom. I found myself having to move around in my seat every 30 seconds. Flight attendants were slow to respond. Inflight entertainment was a SkyMall magazine free viewing of the news networks (FOX ABC etc.) free flight tracking software and slow overpriced wifi for 8 USD. Turbulence was awful coming into LGA. Only good thing about was that you get 2 bags free."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","July 23 flight 2528. Very poor customer service from flight attendant. I realize its been a long day for them but when customer service is 90% of your job the expectation is that you bite your younger when passengers are upset about unexpected plane changes. Her condescending ""Hun"" is unacceptable."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My plane landed at 6pm today. I wasn't even suppose to leave the plane just board more passengers then off to Flint. Well we all had to unload and wait for them to find another pilot. For an hour were held due to weather issues. Then they decided the pilot would be with us at 9pm this was delayed until 945. So we load get ready to leave at 10.15 and then there was a ""mechanical issue"" that had to be checked. 30 mins later we finally got ready to take off. Then the pilot comes over the PA to tell us we were going back to the gate. So 11.00 at night and were waiting for them to find another pilot. Moral of the story. Save yourself time and money and don't fly Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew from Albany NY to Oakland CA to get married. When the crew found out I was getting married I was presented with a bottle of Korbel champagne! What a lovely gesture from an airline that puts service first."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest is not the on time airline it used to be. I was on a flight from Salt Lake City to Phoenix in march and it was delayed 5 hours. Then my children were flying from Phoenix to Providence as unaccompanied minors in June and they were on the plane and it had an issue so they had to deplane and find another airplane. They arrived 3 hours late and one hour before my husband who was also flying into Providence whose plane was delayed coming from Tampa. So the grandfather had to drive to the airport at 12.30 am to get the kids as they were unaccompanied minors. Now I am on a plane headed to Boston and it is delayed by two hours taking away they night I had planned in the city. I have been a loyal SWA customer but no more."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Non-stop from Rochester to Orlando. Friendly crew. We traveled with our two children one being a toddler. The staff were friendly and courteous and checked on us several times. We didn't have any delays except on return and it was only ten minutes. I would definitely fly Southwest again!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Great flight. Flew from TPA-MDW non-stop. Nothing bad on the whole flight. Had a slight delay because there was a passenger who could not find his seat. Flight had an early arrival. Would fly again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I fly every other week and have been a loyal SW customer for years. I have however noticed that more and more recently over the past year that my flights are delayed. I'm not sure if its an issue that arose from the AirTran acquisition or just their rapid expansion and growth but something is definitely amiss. More frequent and longer delays have me worried about the future and continuing to use SW exclusively. I have found that the best way to avoid said delays is taking one of the first few flights of the day avoiding delays that seem not to stem from weather/mechanical issues but rather confusion that just seems to pick up steam throughout the day. If you don't like to wake up early bring a good book!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Nashville-New Orleans on July 1st. Slightly delayed due to weather where the incoming plan left from but after that it was good. Free soft drink snack and checked bag can't believe Ryanair are based on Southwest worlds apart."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","This is one of the worst customer care I have seen I booked my a flight for my children (12 and 9) as junior travelers because SWA had told me they would allow my sister to pick them up at the gate and they do not need someone there through out the flight. Flight delayed an hour and did not allow my sister to the gate. SWA personnel told her they would bring back the kids. However when my sister saw the woman (without the kids) her answer was they did not pay the fee. SWA left them to sort it out on their own at 2am at Boston airport!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I am from Tucson and live in San Diego. I make about 3 trips per year back to Tucson and usually drive every time. I decided to try flying to save time. The car picked me up at 6.55pm on 6/12 for flight 499 from SAN to TUS (9.05 flight time). I waited in the Airport for 2 hours until we finally boarded at 9.15pm sat on runway for 20 minutes and finally took off at 9.42pm. Again the flight was supposed to take off at 9.05pm. Crew were unapologetic and slow moving. We didn't land until 10.50pm. On the way back to San Diego on flight 1858 we were supposed to leave at 9.30am. It is 9.39am now and the estimated departure is now 10.15am. I have heard no updates from staff. No announcements. I will never fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My flight to Chicago from Ft. Lauderdale via St. Louis 5/12-13/2013 was interrupted by extremely bad weather in Chicago at MDW. Southwest staff were very involved in getting myself and all the other passengers on Flt 352 to our destination. I did arrive late but did indeed arrive and so did my luggage."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","23-27 May 2013 Columbus OH - CMH to Ft. Lauderdale FL - FLL. Southwest is our preferred airline and we fly 3-5 times a year. Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board. We love how friendly the flight crews are and that their fun personalities come through during the flights. They are funny personable helpful. During one flight there was loud knocking on the outside of the plane which caused the plane to be re-routed to change planes. Southwest gave us a credit for the trouble without us asking."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I had a connection in ATL on my way to BWI after taxiing out we went back to the gate with mechanical issues. The de-icer warning light came on. They told us we would have to wait for the plane to be fixed as there were no available planes after de-boarding they said they had found another plane for us. It got us to our destination 5 hours late I missed my shuttle and had to rent a car to arrive at my destination on time. I called SWA and they willingly issued me a travel voucher for $300 to cover the cost of the car. I was happy with this compromise although cash would have been best. The crew etc were fine no issues there. The only thing I can say and it might be too critical is I would have expected them to be more proactive about reimbursing for the inconvenience."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","CLE-MCI with a stopover at MDW. The flight crew were attentive and nice and the plane a Boeing 737-700 was very clean."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I will never fly Southwest again even though they were $300 cheaper than the opposition. I have never had this many flight delays in my 10 years of flying combined that I have had with SWA in the last 2 days! The weather has been good! If you want to save money and don't care about things like arriving/departing on time they aren't that bad. Also I am not a fan of the royal rumble/every man for his own seat scenario that plays out every flight. I sincerely felt as if we were playing musical chair every time that we dumped off another filled-to the seats load that we just picked up on our fourth stop. Putting my bag way in the front and then hiking to the back for my seat wasn't a blast either. All in all the savings in my opinion does not warrant the lack of professional services that should be granted from an airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX-LAS-DEN flight delayed due to mechanical problems. After a 2 hr delay gate agent announced we would receive $100 vouchers off future travel. We couldn't re-book on the next flight as it was full. Unfortunately problem was not fixed and flight was canceled 4 hrs after scheduled departure. We were re-booked and arrived 6 hours late. While I understand mechanical issues happen such a long delay is unacceptable on a short 1 hr flight such as LAX-LAS. Southwest should have been able to swap out an aircraft at a major hub such as LAX. Prompt re-booking when the problem was first discovered could have got passengers to their destinations sooner. Otherwise cabin was clean and In-flight service good featuring pretzels peanuts and complimentary soft drinks. The new ""Evolve"" seating is uncomfortable and cramped with 31"" pitch. Admittedly such a lengthy delay is not customary for Southwest but their overall punctuality and cabin comfort has deteriorated in the past few years."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I'm consistency taking Southwest out of Midway to a variety of different places (LAX PHX ABQ DEN HOU LAS) and its usually the redeye. I can always judge the best and worst of airlines based on their customer service during their redeye hours. Airlines staff have always been friendly and accommodating. My partner for example was feeling ill after a trip and he was granted an early boarding pass after explaining his situation to the boarding crew. You also can't beat two free bags and no change fees; I was able to use the funds from a canceled flight towards another. Rewards program is pretty good too especially if you have a Southwest card."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAS-SEA first time flying Southwest my whole experience should be described as a visit to the zoo you line to the check in kiosks at airport where you print your boarding pass and insert the bags into the system then line again to see the agent with your tags the funny part is yet to come! Boarding process as someone here said is a cattle car thing they board by groups and family traveling together in different groups start scenes on the gate it delays everything. Onboard crew not well groomed I had the impression they hated being there. The more I fly American legacy carriers the more I stop complaining about Brazilian airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I fly Southwest a lot even though I don't like their cattle car boarding procedure. My latest problem with them is their customer service or lack of. I had a flight scheduled from Little Rock to Houston which was delayed 50 minutes so would miss my connection in Houston. Called to reschedule for the next day and was told I would have to pay an extra $170 for changing my flight. They offered no help and insisted I would have to pay the upgrade fee even though they had plenty of seats on flights the next day. If the flight had been delayed an hour instead of 50 minutes they would've changed my flight free!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Badly handled 3-hour delay CMH to DEN flight. This is the first time in my history with Southwest so I don't know who to blame for the misinformation lack of information and lack of concern from the CMH ground personnel. Obviously my unfailing praise for Southwest has been tempered. I hope they do some personnel training so future passengers are treated better. Date of this was 5/20/13."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest airlines was able to give me the worst experience I ever had flying in an airplane which is very difficult considering I am on a flight 3-4 days a week. This was on Flight 110 from FLL to BNA on May 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop. However 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel. I have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 60-90 mins. This speaks about Southwest's abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics. The flight pushed back from gate after 1.20pm even though the gate was closed 5-10 mins before it and its now 3.03pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill. There hasn't been a single word or indication of when the expected time of departure or ETA is and the flight staff seem to be only smiling at our misery."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","RNO-ONT-RNO. All flights on time if not a little early. Staff pleasant ground crew pleasant. Made a brief stop in Vegas on the way to Ontario and a brief stop in Oakland on the way back. Very quick turn around times. Full flights on all sectors and staff even managed to do a quick beverage service on a 35 minute flight. Southwest has a good product and I will continue to be a pleased customer."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Take Southwest weekly from Portland OR to Las Vegas. Flights in the morning have been on time. Late night returns have run from 45 mins to 2 hours delayed. Flight crews are excellent and professional. 4 non-stops between Portland and Las Vegas during the work week 2 bags checked bags free and no change fees keep me a loyal customer. Besides the later return flights and Southwest frequent schedule changes I have nothing but praise for this airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Columbus ticket counter was rude and condescending. Flight was delayed getting to Chicago. On leg from Chicago to PDX our previous flight delay made us the last to enter the plane. We were traveling with a 6 week old baby and a 4 year old. The flight crew did not try to help us by asking people to move seats so we were separated for the flight. It was a terrible experience. It has been a while since we flew SW but I can say that we will avoid this airline as much as possible."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Excellent fare! I flew round-trip from DAL (Dallas Love Field) to SEA (Seattle) for $228. round-trip. All flights arrived within 10 minutes of scheduled times. The flights in both directions stopped in Albuquerque. Inflight service was consistent. We had crew changes in ABQ in both directions. Although all crews were fine some were better than others."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We had an issue with our tickets and time our flight was to leave Indy Southwest had cancelled our original flight but had not notified us that our flight was leaving at 6.45 vs 8.10 therefore we missed our flight. The Southwest staff at Indy were very apologetic and helpful they placed on the next flight out which was a direct flight bought us breakfast and gave us vouchers to use in the future. Flight crew on this flight were excellent!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Horrible experience we sat in the plane for an hour only to realize that the flight was cancelled because a small plastic emergency sign would not illuminate! I suspect there was more to it than that because the plane was empty on around 20 people on board. Everyone on board suspected that they cancelled this flight because it was empty. There were no more flights out that night and we had to be in Phoenix by 7:30 am for a competition. So after getting the cold shoulder from the front desk and a voucher that she was to lazy to put in my name and she couldn't refund our flight! (we had to do that the next day). We drove all night to make the competition the next morning."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have taken several flights recently from Denver to Burbank CA. Each time we left on time and usually arrival ahead of time. The Early Bird Check-in is well worth the few dollars. Having two free bags to check-in enabled me to avoid the part I usually dread - hoisting the bag into the overhead locker. The customer service was great! The other thing I really appreciate is having porters at the airport to check in the bags."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Five flights over the last two weeks Islip to BWI to ATL to MDW to LAX then San Diego to Oakland all left and arrived on time effortless check in. Comfortable seats and reasonable leg room. All in all an experience that beats all other US domestic carriers. I have platinum elite status with another carrier here but for domestic flights Southwest beat them hands down."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","The prices are great and the staff on the airplane are always friendly. The staff on the ground/at the gate are always less than desirable. My husband and I have flown Southwest 3 times in the last year from Baltimore and all 3 times I have a seat but he is on Standby. They overbook flights all the time and then act like they're doing me a favor by finding someone else to take a later flight. I paid for my ticket(s) at least 2-3 months in advance. The customer service is absolutely awful at BWI. Never again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Last Monday (3/18/13) flight 1990 from SNA to SJC was 20 minutes late and this raised the possibility that the plane would not be able to take off before the 10pm airport curfew. The gate agent repeatedly motivated us to expedite our boarding. The flight took off before the curfew and the cabin crew provided their usual friendly service during flight. We arrived at SJC only 10 minutes behind schedule despite the late departure. For non-stop flights this airline remains my top choice for domestic flights."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Took two flights with Southwest during March - New Orleans to Nashville and Nashville to Newark. We were delayed a few hours on the Nashville-Newark trip due to bad weather but were kept informed at all times and we were impressed by the good humour and personalities of the flight and cabin crew. Definitely worthwhile checking in online 24 hours prior to flight as you can get a good position in the queue for boarding. Overall a great budget option comparable to our home grown equivalent Virgin Australia. We were rewarded with a $100 travel voucher for the delay from Nashville also - much appreciated. Would definitely recommend Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We flew from MSP into Las Vegas and had a great flight. Staff at the check in gate were friendly and had a sense of humor! Staff aboard plane were helpful and had a smile! A pleasant change from many airlines we have flown on. The fact that there is no extra baggage fee free snack and free beverage just added to the enjoyment of the flight. Our plane out of Las Vegas was delayed and the connecting flight in Denver actually waited for us! We'll book again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","BUF-MSP-BUF (Feb 28/Mar 8). Excellent value for money and definitely a winning proposition hands down when compared to flying from Pearson (YYZ). Both legs arrived before time. Efficient operation with crew (both apt and air) always on the ball with updates. On the return leg they scheduled a Boeing 737-900 (bright and with lots of overhead cabin space) to accommodate the additional load due to storm cancellation the day before. BUF and MDW do not have the best options for food but you can always find something ok. Don't count on much for breakfast at MSP if flying out early."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Traveling from MCO to BDL plane had a mechanical problem at MCO and we were forced into a delay of 4 hours. They gave every passenger a $200 voucher for the inconvenience. As usual fantastic crew and even provided us with free cocktails."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","March 8th our air travel with another carrier completely fell through (weather related issues). We went to the Southwest ticket counter to see if there was any possibility they could help us. Several different options were given even though we had a tight schedule and were looking to leave ASAP! Once aboard the flight the bins had great room (although some people really do push the size of their carry-on to ridiculous proportions). Seats were comfortable (even for my husband who has a bad leg) snacks were good and the inflight crew were great!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","CMH-MDW-LGA return. Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected. Definitely something WN may have to work on."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Our flight from San Jose to Phoenix was cancelled because the Portland flight had a light bulb go out and they took the plane that was designated for Phoenix. We had paid for early bird seating and had numbers A31 & 32 but were given numbers B21 & 22 and had to sit in the middle seats. It was a miserable flight!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Got stuck in Kansas City last night due to the storm and was the only flight out before Friday so I jumped on. Well even with the new seating line-up and a B assignment so I was able to snag an aisle seat it still was pretty unpleasant. Plane was full ran out of overhead bins people were grumpy seats seemed really tight and just overall was not a very good experience. I was willing to pay extra for ""business class"" but they were already taken. I might be in the minority however I will gladly pay a little more for an assigned seat plenty of overhead and a slightly less full flight on some of the other carriers that I fly on a weekly basis. This is not an airline for business travelers. Hopefully I won't be seeing myself on a SouthWest flight anytime soon."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Several flights over the last couple of months the most recent which was DAL-STL-BWI-LIT-DAL. Online check-in and bag check has been painless crews have been friendly and occasionally even entertaining and all flights have either been on-time if not a little early. Flights have been on a variety of 737s (300 500 and 700 series) both with the new and old seats. All seats provide 32-33"" pitch and better legroom than most domestic carriers. However planes with the newer seats can be a little uncomfortable on the thighs after 3 hours or so beware on longer flights. Price of WiFi has recently been increased to $8 or $5 for streaming TV/movies only but you can access Southwest.com a shopping site and a flight tracker for free. Free soft drinks are provided along with either peanuts/pretzels and/or a bag of chips (only on longer flights). I paid for EarlyBird on some flights checked in exactly 24 hours before on others and forgot a couple of times and checked in a few hours after. Beware that if you either don't pay for EarlyBird or forget to check-in exactly 24 hours in advance you will end up in the mid-B group and you will have your carry-on checked as bin space runs out by that point. Also on the most recent DAL-STL leg I got stuck with a B boarding pass despite paying for EarlyBird. Otherwise no real problems at all."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew round-trip St Louis to Omaha. Both flights left on time and arrived even a little early. FAs were friendly and smiled. I checked in online 24 hours before and got a good boarding number both times. The planes were clean and the leather seats were comfortable. All in all Southwest is a good product."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I question Southwest Airline's Earlybird Check-in. Today's flight from Ft. Myers Florida to Philadelphia PA Flight 1431. I had booked and purchased ""Earlybird"" check-in back on 8/22/12. I was given Boarding Pass #B- 4. I sat next to someone who did not have ""Earlybird Check-in and checked-in hours before the flight and was given Boarding Pass A-36. This is not the first time this has happened to me."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SJC (San Jose CA) to SNA (Orange County CA) on Dec 31 2012 return Jan 2 2013. Both flights within 15 minutes of scheduled departure time. Orderly boarding gate agents professionally enforcing the A–B–C boarding-group sequence. Power outlets at the SNA gates seating areas! On-line check-in exactly 24 hours before both flights gave me an 'A' boarding group on both flights. Pilots and Flight Attendants announcements were a nice mix of professional and funny. Both flights were brief (less than 60 minutes in the air) but FA's still managed to give us a free drink and a peanut/pretzel snack. Two suitcases flew for free. To top things off these flights were by far the most economical option for this round-trip trek. For domestic direct flights Southwest continues to be my preferred carrier."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Dec 20 2012 Oakland to Los Angeles. Plane returned after 30 minutes in flight to departure airport due to a landing gear problem. When we got back to Oakland told 'this plane is going nowhere'. In 20 minutes we were placed in another plane. 35 minutes on and we had to return to Oakland. Returned to Oakland. I arrived to LA on a third plane missed my international flight and have to pay $414 US dollars to fly 2 days after my planned departure date. Give. a $100 voucher."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flying home for the holidays Southwest cancelled my flight then offered to book me four days later. I had to book my own flight on a different airline to get in before the holidays. Southwest never notified me that my flight was cancelled? On the way back we were delayed 4 hours when Southwest decided to re-route our plane to another city. No explanation. The pilot actually made an announcement to clarify that it wasn't his fault."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Recently flew from Dallas Love Field to Louisville Ky with multiple stops round-trip. All flights were on time with consistent inflight service. The boarding process was fair and orderly. I had an A boarding number on both flights while checking in exactly 24 hours before departure."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Reno - Vegas - Reno. As usual all went well and we were informed of any delays which were only 15 minutes or so. Good service on both flights. Crew were genuine and helpful. Ground staff pleasant and you still can't beat the two free checked bags. Southwest has a good product and will continue to get my business."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew from Albany NY to LAX via Chicago MDW and returned a week later. On time flights good service pleasant crews and no baggage problems on any of the 4 flights. Most of the cabin crews showed a refreshing sense of humor. Nice airline to fly. Flew ""Business Select""."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My latest roundtrip from SJC-PHX-SJC was as usual excellent. Flights left on time and arrived early. Customer service on the ground and onboard was excellent with pleasant staff. Checked in bags free for the first two on this airline arrived intact and quickly. A superb experience when compared with the so-called full service domestic carriers within the US."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","ORF-MDW. 737-700 was clean and nice. Snacks served the seats were comfortable leather and FA's were attentive and helpful. Departed and landed on time. Only complaint: With the open seating my mother and I were put in boarding group B31-60 and couldn't sit together."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My husband and I flew from Las Vegas to Baltimore return. The seats are small and extremely uncomfortable no elbow room. The seat cushions were thin and caused tail bone pain. We will never fly Southwest again for a flight longer than 1.5 hours. Clearly passenger comfort even on a flight of almost 5 hours is not a priority to Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew non-stop from Hartford to Las Vegas and back. Flights were delayed and overbooked. No meal service available food consisted of an assortment of mini ritz peanuts etc. Beverage menu was good."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","RNO-DEN-RNO. All went well. On time except for return flight in which they held the plane 15 minutes for some connecting passengers that were on their way. We were kept informed. Crew were pleasant on all flights. The captain stood by the exit and said his thank you as we all exited. Baggage arrived safely except mine was covered in snow in Denver."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","BWI-DFW-BWI in Big Front Seats. Had misgivings about flying Spirit but decided to give them a chance due to perfect non-stop flight schedule for my meetings and cost savings (Spirit was half the price even after paying extra fees to carry-on bag and Big Front Seat equivalent to a standard US domestic first class seat). Pleasantly surprised: reasonably orderly boarding experience new airplane clean cabin professional crew and on-time flights both ways. Would fly them again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Concerns my wife who flew from Minneapolis with a connecting flight in St. Louis. Final destination Kansas City. Plane left Mpls on time arrived in St. Louis 30 minutes late but were assured connecting flights would hold. Upon arrival the flight left for St. Louis about 10 minutes before the arrival of my wife's flight. There were 18 people on the Mpls flight headed for KC. So presumably the flight to KC had 18 empty seats. Next flight left approximately two hours later. Upon arrival in St. Louis there was no one at the desk they had to hunt down an SW employee to find out what was going on."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","San Diego to San Francisco. Just how a budget airline should operate. No frills but easy check in comfortable seats clean plane on time departure and a sensible boarding system. Never used before but very impressed and all for just $50."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Connecting flight from Indianapolis to Austin. No choice but to fly. Got to Dallas and have been stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours and counting. I could have driven from Dallas to Austin. The car is faster less hassle and more reliable for these trips. I have to travel back to Dallas tomorrow and you can bet it will be on 4 wheels!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","San Jose CA [SJC] to Seattle WA [SEA] on 10/10/12 returning on 10/14/12. Flight time is only 1:45 and maybe this is why I didn't mind having no video or audio entertainment there was WiFi access available for purchase. First time dealing with their reservations system via phone and the process of re-booking was quick clear and painless. Flights were on time cabin crew friendly and efficient soft drink peanuts and cheese crackers were free and my checked bag was free. I look forward to flying with them again for the holidays in December."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Most recently I flew round trip from Bradley in Hartford CT to BWI. Southwest is definitely a mixed bag. I guess if you have a small barking dog it's great for you. Unfortunately if you are stuck on the plane in the vicinity of this yapping dog which yapped incessantly for the entire flight it's not so great. If you were lucky enough to get an ""A"" ticket that's wonderful but if you end up with ""C"" like I did that means you are forced to fend for yourself to try and find space in the overstuffed overhead bins. Since I don't check baggage and can never seem to be lucky enough to get an ""A"" ticket I'll only fly Southwest out of sheer necessity. It's always a free-for-all stampede of confusion-in this case the flight was overbooked so you've got people milling about unsure what's up. The space for standing in line for the flight is ludicrous since the line is largely ignored by most-like standing in line at the movie theatre for tickets-all of a sudden people just happen to show up to join their party and cut in front of you without an excuse me or any kind of courtesy whatsoever. Flying on Southwest is like getting on a bus-no assigned seats. You definitely feel like part of the herd only difference is you do get a couple of packages of peanuts and a cold drink from a smiling flight attendant."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I travel from the Washington area to Denver several times a year. Previously I used United but I am increasingly using Southwest. The flights are cheaper and the quality of service is higher. My only complaint about Southwest is that the seat could have used a little more padding. I realize delays due to weather or other problems occur but United lies about the cause."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew round-trip SJC-LAS-SJC outbound on Sep 11 (flight 328) returning on Sep 14 (flight 259). The outbound flight was delayed 4 hours. Initially we had to wait for a couple of hours due to bad weather in LAS. That issue is not the airline's responsibility of course. However after we were told that LAS airport was open again we were delayed by about an hour because staff were not able to match the people on board with their passenger manifest. Cabin crew went through the cabin 3 times counting the number of passengers. A ground staff member went through the plane and checked our ID's one by one. Passengers were getting irritated as the clock ticked. Eventually they figured out that 1) a passenger made it into the plane without turning in a boarding pass and 2) a passenger was now without ID because the ground person checking the ID's left the aircraft with the ID and did not return it to the passenger. / Overall I think it was ""nicely done under the circumstances"" but the ground/gate agent(s) made things harder for the passengers and the cabin crew. The return flight from LAS to SJC was uneventful. The airfare was substantially cheaper than their competition and service was nice once we got airborne. I still recommend SWA to my friends and relatives for short non-stop trips."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX-OAK on a 737-300. Even though the flight was under an hour they gave us a free soft drink as well as a snack. Flight attendants good. Got good value for money flights very cheap and bags were free."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew SW from Denver to Philadelphia on 7 September. Flight was delayed by an hour due to weather in the Philadelphia area but we were kept informed of changes which was good. Boarding was nowhere near as stressful as I imagined (compared to the UK low cost carriers) and managed to get a window seat. Seats are very comfortable with adequate legroom certainly as much as any other airline in economy. Crew were very friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Free soft drinks and as many snacks as you wanted were given out though no IFE. This flight had WI-FI which was good. Overall a pretty good flight which I would happily do again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew with them last month between Las Vegas and Orange County. I have to say for a budget airline they include hold bags in their ticket price a free non-alcoholic beverage and a bag of peanuts that's more our European equivalents offer. A very comfortable leather seat with generous leg room and nice flight attendants. Checking in at the airport without my confirmation number to hand was easier than I first thought. The check in agent picked up on the fact I was not a non U.S citizen and checked us in."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew from Boston to Baltimore on Aug 28 aboard a 737-700. Great experience all around. All staff friendly and helpful. Plane was clean seats in good shape. Very comfortable seats. All pax had arrived at the gate early so we boarded and pushed back almost 15 minutes early so of course we arrived early. Short easy flight but they still offered complementary peanuts and soda water or juice. This plane was Row 44 WiFi equipped so it was available for $5. I didn't try it because it was just a 55 minute flight. I had a great experience with Southwest no hesitation to fly them again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","ORF-CLE with a stopover at Chicago Midway. On the first leg of the journey it was a Boeing 737-700 and the flight attendants were fun to be around. Leather seats were nice and comfy and the drinks were good. They even gave out complimentary bags of peanuts which most airlines don't do any more. On the flight to Cleveland it was a 737-300 which was older but nice we got peanuts again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have been on 6 flights in two days and all flights have been top notch. Take off on time arrive early. Boarding fast and hassle free. The gate staff are nice as are flight crew. I am really impressed and highly recommend SWA."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX-MDW-IAD-TUC-LAX. First the bad - 4 hour delay at Midway and only found out about it after peering into gate agents screen. Line-up by numbers worked well and even with a C 10 we managed to get a window seat (at the back). Snacks quite good and booze cheap. On the 4 hour delay flight (to IAD) there were only around 20 of us left and FA's did their level best to help us all out and make us comfortable. I think they were on the 12th hour of a long day. Better than most US domestics in my opinion."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","ONT-OAK and later SMF-ONT. For the first flight we booked a 2-3 weeks in advance (unfortunately just as fares jumped as seemed to occur every few days) and paid the $10 ""Early Bird"" fee but still had numbers in the low 40s. So no chance of bulkhead or emergency row. Did better on the second flight and managed to get first row bulkhead seats. Free drinks but only a cup (you don't get the can). Flights were pretty much on time."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My family and I were given apparent ""seat numbers"" on our tickets which actually just mean the order in which you line up at the gate and the seating was actually open (and poorly organized I might add). I did not purchase the tickets personally and did not know about the open seating policy so I thought someone was in my seat and told a flight attendant about it. She stared at me like I was crazy. It took me quite a while to find a seat on the plane and neither my wife nor myself could sit with our very young daughter in the end. Before the return flight my wife had to get something out of her luggage so we asked an employee if she could get it for her. The woman rolled her eyes at us and scoffed before calling someone to get our luggage. The problem with this airline didn't end there. We waited an hour at baggage claim before they finally started loading bags onto the carousels. Fly with Southwest if you like inefficiency."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Poor customer service. Daughters first solo flight a disaster. San Diego to Denver to Pittsburgh (no plane change just a stop in Denver). Got to Denver early then delays left hour and 20 minutes late. Get to Pittsburgh not only did her luggage not make it but neither did some other passengers. Filed report. They said they'd call when luggage found no phone call from them. Went to San Diego airport (40 minute trip one way plus parking for a second time) to see if luggage here. No luck."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","MCO-PHL return. Flight to PHL was only 15 minutes late leaving after posting a two-hour delay. The return left on time. Two free checked bags a cup of soda and snacks plus overhead comedy via funny flight attendants. My only qualm is the boarding; had A positions but on the flight to Orlando a large group (who were holding C) blocked the path to the gate and wouldn't move and the gate agent just let us walk around them instead of asking them to move. As the gate area was crowded this cause some problems getting to the check-in desk. But overall not bad."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew between Denver and Salt Lake City. Crew were funny and helpful telling jokes during most public announcements. Plane arrived on time and was much cheaper as an option than other airlines. The only criticism I had was you must have your booking reference to hand if you go to the desk for check in as they don't appear to have it ""in the system"" if you just give them your name but this may have changed."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We can all agree the airline industry is at an all time low. My experience with SWA yesterday restores my faith that someone cares about passengers. A four hr delay at Midway - airport staff were apologetic and sincere the crew were accommodating and we received an unexpected $100 voucher. SWA used to be the cheapest but the fares have gone up. I believe to cover free baggage. But in our case it was cheaper because the fees on the other airlines made their flights higher. I know their are a lot of complaints about seats. I used to hate SWA for that reason. I also don't like that the 24hr checkin still gives you only an A30 at best since they sell the first half of the A seats now for business select or a fee. But if you check in early you still have a good selection. The other airlines are sneakier. You may get an assigned seat but do you really have a choice? Most of my recent flights have shown me a chart selection of all centre seats and the aisles and windows for sale! Not a good way to build loyal customers."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Round Trip Newark to Denver. All flights on time. Boarded with A group. Completely uneventful and not exciting flights. Cheapest air fare and bags free is a big plus. All in all a quality experience if bland."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","After a five hour delay (understandable because it was weather related) we finally boarded our plane to San Francisco via Chicago. It wasn't until Chicago that they told us that our leg to San Francisco was canceled and the plane was now traveling to Los Angeles. Being stranded in Chicago with a five month old is not my idea of a vacation. On the return trip we got routed to Minneapolis (again weather). However when we did get to Chicago we were told we now had to switch planes for the final leg back to CT. We specifically booked flights with no plane change because that is a hassle with an infant. My family will never fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I fly frequently for my business. Southwest usually has the cheapest fares and the fact that bags fly free. Their ""Open Seat"" boarding policy is a little different since they are one of the only airlines that have this policy. I do see both sides of the arguments where you like to know where you seating upon booking the flight but also love the freedom of choosing your own seat as you get on the plane. The earlier you check in the better the chance of getting the seat of your preference. I hardly ever experience rudeness from staff. Flight attendants often add in comedic little quips in their safety instruction demonstration which I saw as quite amusing. When it comes to flying for me 75% of the time I fly with Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew from San Antonio to San Diego flight #2523 on 6/29/12. I was not familiar with their boarding system. I did not know what the number pole at the boarding area was for. I wish they had informed passengers that we need to stay in number order. The guy doing the boarding stopped me and made me wait while everyone in my group boarded. I thought that was very rude. I also did not know they put the menu in the back of the seat. When I ask the attendant what they have to drink she was very rude and told me to look at the menu. Their fare is cheap. The seats and aisle are very cramped. My flight was 30 minutes late. They take you from A to B - that is about it. My experience left a sour taste in my mouth. I always thought highly of Southwest but not anymore."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SLC-DEN-MDW - Flying with my 3 kids and 2 nephews to visit Grandpa in Chicago. On our Denver layover after waiting for 5 hours our flight was canceled due to electrical problems at MDW. We were directed to the SW ticket gate into a line with hundreds of people. After waiting in the line for an hour with 5 kids and hearing other passengers leave the line being told they would not get a flight for 2 days I found a hotel and rented a car for the night. In the morning I called SW to ask about rebooking our canceled flight. The agent told me I had to go to the airport to get someone to do it for me. She confirmed that my only option to get on a SW flight would be to drag 5 kids to the airport to wait for the next available flight in 40 hours and hope we got on that one. That is not a reasonable option so we rented a minivan in Denver and drove to Chicago. SW also lost our luggage. Multiple attempts to call resulted in no one helping us. When we arrived in Chicago went to Midway and the bag was sitting there. I am so frustrated with an industry that is all take no give. You make them all these guarantees jump through their hoops and they give you nothing in return not even a refund when their product fails."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest gets zero stars for one reason and one reason only. Their ""Open Seating"" policy. Bags fly free but at SW passengers are just another bag. You pay good money to stand in a cattle chute and then maybe have to ask someone's permission to sit in a seat if you are not lucky enough to get a good boarding position. With other airlines I know I will have a seat of my choosing no matter when I board. This is called ""Customer Service"" which is apparently a foreign concept to SW."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew from Vegas to Chicago. Once we got the Vegas airport we noticed a very disgruntled vibe. The usually happy Southwest employees were very grouchy and seemed bothered to be there. We boarded the plane actually got the very first seat with tons of leg room and finally had the opportunity to stretch out for the long ride home. From the moment the plane was to take off the complaining started. I guess there was some sort of issue with the transair merger and the flight attendant union because that is all I heard about for the entire flight. They just went on and on as if they were out for coffee at some cafe. I don't even think they realized how inappropriate it was to complain while they were on the job and within earshot of customers. It made us very uncomfortable and annoyed. Once we landed and all of bags didn't make it that kind of sealed the deal for us. No more Southwest. Beware when you check your bags you may not see them again. We did get our bag back at midnight so we were the lucky ones. I guess the ""we don't really care"" attitude of Southwest is my major complaint."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","6/08/12 Flew from LAX (Los Angeles) to LAS (Las Vegas). Flight was delayed by 20 minutes which was not even bad. We were further delayed in the air for 20 more minutes because President Obama was landing at the same airport as we were. Other than that the flight attendants were courteous the seats were decent had good leg room (I'm 6.2""). Returned on 6/12/12 LAS to LAX. The incoming Flight was delayed for 2.5hrs due to bad weather from the region it was coming from. I got my round trip ticket for $90. I'll definitely fly again!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have flown Southwest a number of times now. I have never experienced a problem with their staff whatsoever. I just got back from a trip from KMCO (Orlando) to KPIT (Pittsburgh) I am a student pilot myself so when we landed I asked one of the flight attendants if I could peek in the flight deck and they were very nice. The seats are all leather with adequate leg room. That is coming from a guy over 6 feet tall. I like the fact that Southwest does not separate the cabin by class. Apparently recently they began offering Nilla wafers as an In-Flight snack. I did not particularly care for them. Bottom line I would recommend flying Southwest. You can get a round trip ticket for $200."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","When my flight was changed I thought my seat was guaranteed - after waiting 6 hours at the airport and finally on the plane I got called to the front just to get pulled for another passenger and then was told I need to pay extra to guarantee a seat on the next flight that was another 4 hours away. The worst 11 hours of my life."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I printed my boarding passes at home I got A50 for departure 6 hours after the printing starting time (24 hours) and for my return I got A44 printed only 20 minutes after the beginning of the 24 hours window. So whether you print your boarding pass early or late makes no difference. At the airport there are no instructions about the boarding process. So finally I stood in line with the rest. On my return they had 2.5 hours delay the excuse being the weather in Houston. On the return trip the flight attendants gossiped and laughed loudly like 2 schoolgirls preventing us the exhausted passengers from getting a bit of rest. All in all do your best to avoid Southwest even if you pay a little more."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX to Vegas to Burbank. On time seats very comfortable cheerful staff. Very laid back feel. The only downfall is no entertainment and planes seem a little old. Great for the price."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Flew SWA for the first time between Boston and St Louis for business. On the way out to STL I had a non- stop however on the return I had to fly through BWI (Baltimore). Nevertheless both flights were pleasant and I was very impressed with their overall care of their paying customers. Will definitely fly them again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Two round trips so far have been excellent in every respect: on time easy boarding pleasant crew (glad to say official flight time is under 2 hours; can't comment on comfort on a longer haul.) Of course SW is known for the several special ways it rises above the competition: consistently cheap fares (at least for our route) those two pieces of free checked baggage and the free reservation changes. Easy to use website is another nice advantage. As I mentioned among us we will likely be doing 6 or more round trips on this SW route each year for a while so I will be sure to review again if any of the above changes."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","RNO-DEN-IAD-BWI-LAS-RNO. Good fares pleasant staff on-time for the most part and when a delay comes up we are informed. This trip held true to that again. But my only issue on this trip and it is not a fault but rather a comment. Flying cross country non-stop on a 737 for 5 hours is a bit brutal. We did get on a brand new 737-800 for the longest sector from BWI to LAS which was nice but still a very long trip on a small plane that was packed to the hilt. The crew were pleasant on all sectors. The ground staff at BWI were great and the Skycap had us laughing. All in all a good product with no complaints really. Just remember to buy a meal before you get on a long flight and if you don't mind a long flight on a small plane then Southwest is the way to go. Plus you can't beat the two free check-in bags."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We fly SWA on all occasions from San Jose CA to Ontario CA. We have a 5 year old and this is where my comment comes in. Thinking my son has passed the pre-boarding age we ignored the PA announcement and waited in line. The gate agent spotted my family and I and came to personally asked us to board along with the other pre-boarders. Because of this gesture we now minimized flying Alaska Airlines. These two airlines were our sources for price comparisons whenever we do our travel. Now we don't even bother as the prices are relatively similar and go directly to SWA."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest are a cheap and cheerful airline and you get what you pay for. The cabin crew are generally friendly and helpful the aircraft's clean although seating is tight as you would expect on a budget airline. Over the past couple of years I have flown 7 sectors with them and my only complaint is with the ground check-in staff. They are with rare exception a miserable unhelpful lot who seem to think their faces would break if they smiled. The check-in system is different to what I am used to and the counter staff seemed to look down their noses in disdain when I was not sure how things worked. Would I fly with them again probably not there are a lot of other airlines competing for the same business."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","OAK-ABQ return. From Oakland check-in was quick but security was a hassle inflight they offered stale Nilla wafers and the usual drinks so admittedly that part was very ordinary. Staff were very nice though and seemed to like their jobs and the seats were very comfortable. The return from Albuquerque was pretty much the same except better security more drink runs but less room. Still it gets the job well done and at a great price and it flies out of Oakland. I'll come back even it isn't high-frills."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","DCA to Islip NY on US Airways Express/Republic Airlines/Air Wisconsin (these three names were either on the plane or my ticket) and it was not a good experience. BWI to Islip my normal way to get there on Southwest is professional clean easy to book and I get an overall confident feeling that they all know what they are doing. It took being lured into the DCA/US Airways flight by the relative convenience to see the other side but I learned my lesson. I'll drive the 50 miles to get to BWI from now on."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We travelled on three different legs with Southwest recently and were very impressed with the friendly crew clean and comfortable plane free baggage and the plane left and arrived on time or early on each occasion. On two of three legs we paid the extra $10 for priority boarding - well worth as the flight was quite cheap compared to other airlines in the first place. The free drink and nuts were a bonus."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I usually enjoy travelling on Southwest I like the relaxed and friendly crew. The free checked bag policy is really a plus. The boarding and open seating policy is speedy and efficient and its no problem finding seats for the family together if you check-in online 24 hours in advance. The coffee if free and as much as you want seconds and thirds on snacks too. 5$ in-flight Wifi is great for doing work. Not so great for video streaming though. The seats are comfortable enough I never get uncomfortable."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","As a family of four with children ages 7 and 11 we had to sit in 3 different locations both on our flight to Florida and our return trip. This was unacceptable and staff simply shrugged and said there was nothing they could do about it. They did ask a single passenger to move so that our 7 year old be permitted to sit with his mother on the return flight. I would very highly recommend against any and all families ever even considering to fly Southwest airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","In the past two weeks I flew Southwest cross country and also another major airline. The contrast between Southwest and this other airline was unreal. Friendly courteous organized on time generous with baggage check (no fees for first 2) generous with snacks/drinks. The only reason I took another airline in the first place was because Southwest didn't fly to the location I had to visit."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We flew Southwest with our 3 young boys. Extremely nervous because my older son is peanut and peanut dust allergic. Flight attendants were aware and made the flight peanut free. Our 1st plane was freshly cleaned we were able to pre-board. Seats are leather so made it easier to clean. Our return flight flight attendants also made sure no peanuts were served the check-in counter confirmed his allergy was in the system and everyone was aware. We also pre-boarded and on both flights sat in bulkhead seats. Southwest was great extremely considerate and very professional."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Besides the obvious advantages of reasonable prices 2 free checked bags and free coffee tea water soda and snacks on flights what you need to know about Southwest is that they are almost always on time and quite often arrive early. We have never had a problem with luggage - checked or carried on. Flight staff are pleasant Seats aren't the roomiest ever but flights aren't that long."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I fly Southwest frequently and until my most recent flight I have been a satisfied customer. Last flight was my first on a plane with their redesigned/reconfigured interior. There is simply less legroom with the new seat configuration. I was cramped and uncomfortable. The seats themselves are very nice but if you are 6 ft or taller you will be uncomfortable. The purpose of this review is to simply give a heads up to people whose height might make a long trip very uncomfortable."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Recently took 7 Southwest flights within the USA and could not complain about one of them. They don't have select seating but as they are usually short flights it doesn't matter. All flights were on time and the staff very friendly."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAS-OMA-LAS. I like flying Southwest because it's the most hassle-free airline in the US. However the plane I took yesterday was filthy and I am not talking about dirt from the last flight. This dirt was on the carpet and side of seats. Food particles dried up soda chewing gum etc. Keeping a cabin clean is easy and should be paramount."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Newark-Denver return. Outbound flight on time checked in easily online and bag drop and boarding was swift. Cabin crew were excellent and very attentive. Complimentary drinks were great and snacks were good. A meal for the 3.5 hour flight would have been more substantial. Flight back was 3 hours late. We checked in online without difficulty. Bag drop and boarding was just as swift and the crew were excellent. Legroom both ways was well above what you get with most low cost airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My wife and I recently flew from Newark to Reno via Chicago (Midway) and then Reno to Newark with a connection in Phoenix. The boarding process was simple and quick flight attendants on all 4 planes were very courteous. Our plane from Phoenix was delayed 15 minutes however we landed on time. The other 3 flights all landed early. Pleasant experience highly recommended."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Roundtrip between Baltimore and Greenville SC. Had to leave very early and change in Chicago on the way out which does not make sense. Dislike the general admission seating cattle call. Some passengers were very rude about it on the return flight. Will be sticking with United or another legacy carrier from here on out. Might pay a little more but would rather have a more comfortable flight."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SMF-ONT. Southwest is the only airline non-stop on this route. Check-in was fairly quick. We paid $10 for early check-in and still weren't near the front of the line but managed to get emergency row seats. Service was fine. Nothing special but flight was just an hour long. Flight was on time and our luggage arrived safely."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We recently traveled as a family of 4 with children aged 7 and 11. Due to the fact that there is no reserved seating we were forced to sit in 3 very separate places throughout the plane on both outgoing and incoming flights. Both flights were very miserable. Their rates may be low but do remember the old adage ""you get what you pay for""!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Houston to Newark roundtrip. Two free 50lb checked bags and a carry on and large purse. Staff are friendly planes always clean and leg room is good. They have been updating their fleet with newer restrooms cabin interior and wifi. They give free soda juice water and snacks. Charge for alcohol and energy drinks."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","IND to MSY with a layover in MCO round trip. Flight attendants had conversations with passengers which gave all 4 of my flights a friendly atmosphere. All but 1 of my flights arrived early. Make sure you check-in as soon as you can so you aren't stuck with a middle seat."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX-LAS. Flight left/arrived on time. Quick 45 min flight from LA to Vegas free drink and snack served. Leg room ok as flight was completely full. Southwest allow 2 free checked bags as opposed to most other US airlines who charge for checked baggage."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","BUF-LAX (via PHX) SAN-SFO and SFO-BUF (with a stop in MDW along the way). Paid $125 each way between BUF and LAX and between SFO and BUF and $49 for SAN-SFO. Fare included 2 free checked bags. Excellent value for price paid! All my flights arrived early and were operated by newish 737-700's. All flights (except SFO-BUF) were packed but I got the bulkhead window seats which were very comfortable. FA's were friendly especially on the BUF-PHX and MDW-BUF legs. Having Internet on my long return flight made the time fly by and for the most part it worked very well."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SJC to SNA return. I checked in online for both flights early enough to get an ""A35"" boarding position for both flights and that was good enough to get seats in an emergency exit aisle with great legroom. Both flights on time and flight attendants efficient and friendly. There is no inflight entertainment unless you bring a laptop to use their WiFi and you still get a free soft drink and peanuts/pretzels. Being able to check-in a suitcase for free is fantastic nowadays! I would rate the seat comfort very good."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Chicago Midway to Boston return. Flights operated by a relatively new 737-700. Both on time. Leg room is generous for a low cost carrier. Flight attendants were polite and efficient. I was allowed to check in two 50lb bags for free and to take a carry-on bag as well. Seats were comfortable and leg room decent especially for a low cost. We were served a complimentary snack and offered non-alcoholic beverages with free re-fills. Boarding was efficient. My only quirk with Southwest is that they do not have assigned seating hence getting a preferred seat is tricky unless you pay the extra $10 and get early boarding. I had not done that but in hindsight I think the extra $10 is well worth it (especially if you want a window seat). I highly recommend Southwest due to their efficiency friendly staff and complimentary beverages."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","BUF-TPA return flights on time. B737-700 to Tampa and 737-500 back to Buffalo both quite clean although B737-500 showing its age. FA's friendly especially on the way back to Buffalo. The extra $10 for early boarding was well worth it on return - ended up with a mid ""A"" boarding group number and got the Exit seat with about 3 feet of legroom in front - if you're tall this is the seat you want. My home airport is Toronto but I'll drive to Buffalo for fares that are generally half the price of flying out of Toronto."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Avoid if you are travelling with children over 4 years of age. My wife 5 year old son and I were unable to obtain a boarding pass prior to our arrival at the airport and as a result under Southwest's ""open-seat"" policy we boarded when only single seats were available. My wife politely asked if any passenger would be willing to move so our son could sit with her and no one responded. The flight attendant did not attempt to assist us despite witnessing our dilemma. Fortunately a sympathetic passenger finally offered to move to allow my wife to sit with our son. It appears Southwest has decided that 5 year old children are sufficiently mature to sit apart from their parents on 3 hour flights. I recommend that you avoid Southwest if you are flying with children over the age of 4 or your family may be placed in the same position as mine."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","BOI-SNA round trip. Took my 4 year old son. We had no problems whatsoever on our flights. Connected in Las Vegas heading to SNA then Phoenix heading back to Boise. Flight from SNA to PHX was overbooked but since I was travelling with a 4 year old we got on right after the ""A"" group. I thought the boarding process was odd and I prefer assigned seating but I saved so much money on the lack of baggage fees it was worth it to me. Seats were more comfortable and I had more legroom than on other airlines I've flown. I'd fly SWA again for sure."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SAN-PHX roundtrip. The flight from SAN to PHX was delayed at the gate for 40 minutes in San Diego. The plane however was a new refurbished looking 737-700. Very comfortable. The flight back was on an old worn looking 737-300. The flight was a little bumpy to begin with but it got smoother as we went along. We arrived on time at the gate in SAN. Cabin crew were friendly both ways."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","DEN-LAX to connect with international flight on another carrier. On-time flight was most important. Staff at check-in gate and onboard was pleasant and professional. Clean aircraft. Seat pitch comfortable for 6-foot passenger. Fare same as other carriers but ""Bags fly free"" saved our family $60."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","IND-BWI and BWI-IND. First trip was on a Boeing 737-700 aircraft. Seats a little worn but plane was clean. The flight was rather empty so had three seats to myself. The crew was okay prefer flight attendants to be dressed professionally rather than casual. The flight on the way back was full plane arrived on time in BWI and crew was much better this time round. Plane an older Boeing 737-500 I believe but it was clean and inviting. I got two drinks and a snack which was quite nice."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","LAX-MSP-LAX. A bit quirky typical boarding procedure (line-ups on either side of numbered poles at the gates) smart-alec announcements from both pilots and flight attendants etc. However a value product: no checked baggage fees free snacks coffee and soft drinks reasonable prices for alcohol. Comfortable seating accommodating flight attendants clean airplanes and dependable service on the ground as well as in the air. All four segments of my trip were packed crew remained hospitable and efficient."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Albany to Orlando. Leg room is tight seats not spacious but neither are they overly uncomfortable. Service was excellent. Humorous dialogue and an over all sharp wit one staff member was funny. He alone would make me choose Southwest again but the airline also provided a good value and pleasant trip overall. Free snacks and beverage was a nice change from some other airlines as well."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","ONT-SMF roundtrip. Overall good flight but they definitely need to add TV's on long haul flights. Anyway good airline and cheerful crew."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Both our flights were on time and we had no hassles or problems. Our flight was only about 2 hrs long and we were a little crowded (not tons of leg room etc). I can see where this might be more of a problem for a longer flight but for us it was fine. The plane cabin seats etc. were nothing fancy but they were perfectly adequate and clean - all we needed for a family trip to Florida. Great value for the price - we had a good experience and will definitely fly Southwest in the future."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","DTW-MDW-GSP. Paid extra $10 to get early/priority check-in. Still ended up with boarding numbers in the high 20s. Managed to get one front row and one exit row seat for the first flight and two exit row seats for the second flight. At DTW there were lots of passengers in wheelchairs and a woeful lack of airline personnel available to take them onboard so boarding took a while. Flight into GSP not only took off on time but arrived 30 mins early. It is not always the cheapest option especially if you are adding the $10 earlybird check-in fee but in this case it worked out fine. Still not sure if I like their boarding system since it results in our standing up longer than with other airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Raleigh to Newark via Baltimore Washington. Had great seats on each flight with friendly crews. Nice experience with smooth trips."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My first time flying domestically in the USA LAS-LAX on a $39 fare. I did online check-in the day before and was in the second boarding group. Got a row to myself. Check-in process well organised all automated at the kiosk and then your name is called to drop off your bag at a counter. Flight attendants cheerful for the early hour impressed with being allowed 2 checked bags free."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I am 16 years old and recently travelled with Southwest by myself. I was nervous as this was only my second time flying. I flew SAT to BWI return. I found all of the staff to be courteous and the pilot made regular announcements. Even though there was a delay at BWI the staff kept everyone informed they quickly boarded us and flight actually was shorter than expected. I liked the open seating by paying the extra $10 for early check in I was in the first boarding group and got a window seat on both flights."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I have flown over 100 flights on Southwest and have not had a bad flight. Back in the old days when the first in line got to board first we always arrived early to get the best seats. Now that Southwest issues boarding numbers we always pay the extra $10 to get priority boarding. The system of having no assigned seats is much more efficient and gets the plane off the ground much faster. Like many others I am disappointed that the Rapid Rewards Program has changed. It was a very generous program now it is similar to most of their competitors."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Tampa-New Orleans. First time on a US low- cost good price for tickets. Cabin crew friendly flight crew professional. I was impressed with the seat pitch in Economy for a short sector on B737. I am 6 ft 2 inch but was comfortable compared with Transatlantic B777. I always prefer preselection of seating and not sure why SW are averse. I would happily pay a supplement."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","First time with Southwest as they have only recently begun servicing Newark. EWR-SAN connecting in PHX and Chicago-Midway. Booked hotel and rental car as well. Very pleased with the over all experience. Everything was exactly as stated. I enjoyed the extra inch of legroom compared to my usual airline (Continental). Flight attendants friendly and helpful with frequent offerings of refreshments and snacks. I would like to see them expand their Newark service because I would use them any day."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest avoids punishing customers with extra fees such as change cancellation or bag check fees where possible. If you happen to check your bags late they will accept them and try their best to get them on the plane often faster than you can make it to the gate. If it's too late to check the bags they will place them on the next flight. A-List membership allowed me to bypass check-in and security lines and get preferred boarding almost always resulting in 'first class' seating in the emergency exit row. Companion Pass allowed me to travel around the country with a good friend on the weekends I wasn't commuting for a whole year. Personalized birthday and holiday cards were also nice touches."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","It's very little hassle flights are almost always on time customer service is great. I enjoy the occasional jokes over the PA and the creative ways of doing the safety briefing. I like the first come-first seated policy. In terms of their cabins I find that they have good leg room that's a big selling point for me at 6'2."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My wife and I have flown Southwest often in the past. We've watched the past couple years as Southwest has made cutbacks and the value of their service has declined. Our primary frustration with Southwest comes from a recent flight where we were abandoned in the Denver airport. We arrived at our departure gate in Austin to find the plane running late. When we landed in Denver I checked our connection to see that it was boarding. We arrived to see they had closed the door. We were frustrated that they wouldn't hold the plane for a few minutes to allow connecting passengers to board. We spent the night in a chilly airport and offered no dinner or breakfast voucher."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","PHX-GEG roundtrip. Stop in OAK each way with change of planes outbound. Good trip all flights on time. Seats comfortable FA's were friendly. Only complaint would be collecting bag in PHX upon return. Took over 45 mins at when only 3-4 other flights there. Apparently the conveyor belt kept jamming but they stopped/started no less than 4 times before it was spitting out bags so fast everyone was having issues getting their bags off the belt."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I loved the fact that their system for boarding a plane uses physical structure as well as simple written and verbal directions. It's very effective. I liked that I could choose from multiple snacks and take multiple bags if I wanted. The stewardesses were very friendly."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Will use this airline again when travelling in the US. We flew San Diego to Las Vegas and SW was the only one that offered a direct flight at less than half the price and as a family of 7 we got to sit together. The flight attendants were very friendly."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","In the past I have always been very happy with Southwest however after today I am extremely upset. I had purchased a ticket of which I was not able to use. They were able to extend the unused ticket for 1 year. Today I called to attempt to use the ticket only to find out that I will not be able to use the credit as my trip is 2 weeks beyond the 1 year mark. I called customer service to request an extension ($50.00 fee of which I would happily pay). I am told that I have to wait for the credit to expire prior to their ability to extend the credit. I would then take the risk of not being able to get the flights I need for my upcoming trip. Poor Customer Service Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Never flying Southwest again. Their boarding/seating process is horrible and needlessly stressful; their ""new hip"" thing among flight staff is really annoying. My fiancé and I flew across the country to get married last weekend. Of course we wanted to sit together on the 5 hour flight. But with the ridiculous system of no assigned seats there was no way to assure this. On the way back we got stuck in separate seats surrounded by a yelling and singing boy scout troop. To make things worse the flight attendants cranked up the volume on the PA system and sang the safety demonstration. In fact all announcements were done in song. This should be illegal. They seemed to think it was clever but it was a real nightmare to be strapped into one of those tiny seats surrounded by pimply screaming boy scouts and then endure warbling flight attendants blasting through the overhead speakers. A truly horrible airline. I will pay double triple quadruple to avoid flying Southwest. I will walk or crawl across the country rather than fly with these people."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","This was my first time flying Southwest. I've used United an Delta most other times and now I know why. There is absolutely no room on these planes. your knees are all but touching the seat in front of you and the seats are way too small. I weigh 128lbs and I was very uncomfortable. I was hot and miserable. The captain never spoke to us during the flight. I've never had that happen with any other airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I fly Southwest all the time but this particular trip was not so great! I found a really cheap flight with a 1 hr layover which turned into a 3 hr layover. Because my original flight destination time was so late a 3 hr layer had me arriving at 2am when all public transportation (which I use) has ended. I think I should have been compensated for my transportation to the city."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","As a former Northwest/Delta Airlines customer (exclusively) I may be easier to impress. Southwest recently started direct flights between Phoenix and Minneapolis. We purchased tickets in May at what we considered to be very reasonable fare for a roundtrip to celebrate our grandson's second birthday in Minneapolis. My father passed away two weeks prior to our scheduled departure. I called SW seeking assistance. After a brief discussion regarding the circumstances and flight availability the associate announced a fee of $783.00. With the shortest of pauses (I was choosing an appropriate reaction) he asked me to hold while he consulted with a Customer Care agent. A few more questions resulted in a change in three of the four legs of our trip for a total cost of $10."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I flew SouthWest a number of times between US cities and really like the product they offer. It is low cost and I didn't experience any hidden surprises. I also like the no fuss nature the airplane comes in people get off the next lot get on and it takes off again. It’s great if you just want to get from A to B. The two checked bag allowance is a win as I arrived in the US on an international flight with 2 bags so it was helpful to have these included without additional cost (as many/all other US airlines charged). I will continue to fly SouthWest when I visit the US."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I've been a Rapid Rewards member since 2000 and have spent time on the A-List (but not there currently.) SWA has consistently been above and beyond all other airlines I've flown (AMR Delta Continental) for customer service and they are much more likely to be on-time and not pulling booking shenanigans. Transparency on the (minimal) fees is a giant plus."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I fly SouthWest constantly - they aren't perfect but employees are cheerful legroom and storage room at your feet is better than other airlines bags are free and there are no change fees if you need to change a flights."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","I am done with Southwest. I just got screwed by the inability to change a passenger just like so many others recently. The agent said they have been telling people about this for some time. News to me. As soon as I can arrange it I'm paying off my Southwest credit card and sending it and my rapid rewards card to them in pieces."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Extremely disappointed in Southwest's recent changes to the policy on the inability to change a passenger name once the ticket has been purchased. I bought a ticket for an employee before this policy took effect who was not able to make the trip. Since then SW started supposedly ""enforcing a policy that has been in place"" without any sort of notification. Now I'm out almost $500 because they won't refund the ticket or allow me to use the credit for another passenger - even if it's just transferred to my name. Their reason when I filed a complaint? ""a proactive step to align our business with the general practice of the airline industry"" So it seems SW is in fact purposefully intending to become just another airline. The really upsetting part is that only a week or two earlier another trip for an employee had to be cancelled and I was able to use the flight credit for someone else. Suddenly I can't. No notification at all. I get emails just about every other day from SW advertising their ""get- away"" deals; couldn't they have simply sent out an email letting us know their policy was going to go into effect? I was an extremely loyal SW customer but they've lost my business for good. I know I'm only one of many people this has affected - they told me as much when I called to complain."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Terrible customer service. I purchased tickets for my employees to take a trip in October 2011 and one of the employees can no longer go. This trip has been planned 5 months in advance. Southwest will not let anyone else use the ticket even though we gave 5 months notice. They would not allow any name transfers. Only the named employee could use the ticket no else could go in her place. They would only refund if they were given a copy of a death certificate of the employee."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Travelled SW for the first time because my son gave me and my husband SW giftcards so we booked a trip to Vegas. We paid the extra $10. each was for early bird seating we got A section between 15 and 30 that was good. I think if you are flying as a couple it is worth the extra so you can sit together. I hear some people are saving seats for their partner which I find to be cheap. Anyway to and from Vegas we had good flights I liked choosing my seat. I will fly SW again as long as SW stays with limited extra fees. I used to fly Continental only but they have imposed more fees than I care to read about. Keep up the good work SW and we will stay loyal to you."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Boston to Norfolk via Baltimore early morning. Boston to Baltimore fine but probably only because the flight was nearly empty and I could sleep. Legroom better than on other legacy carriers. Baltimore to Norfolk a horror. A very loud stewardess with a grating Southern accent spent the whole flight on the PA yelling about seatbelts how no drinks would be served due to turbulence (there was no turbulence) how no one could get out of his seat due to turbulence (there was no turbulence) how cute all the screaming babies onboard were and lastly in signature creepy Americana how there were soldiers or something onboard so to give them a loud round of applause for their service. So loud applause and the obnoxious loud flight crew prevented me from getting any sleep on the flight. I understand Southwest has a particular style - a kitsch-laden obnoxious style. It's not for me. At least the bags were free."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Service was good out of PBI plane looked a little tired but seats comfortable. Upon arriving in BWI connecting flight to LGA was delayed 2.5 hrs. They need to improve their LGA service. Got there but late. Still a great airline."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","A mixed-bag trip from Seattle to Washington Dulles . On the plus side I had to change my itinerary at the last minute and was able to do so on Southwest at minimal cost. Flight out was uneventful. Flight back terrible I was stuck in Midway after a Dulles delay the airline stated was a mechanical problem but they refused to provide a hotel voucher. I had to find and pay for my own hotel. The gate agent was very rude."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Is Southwest becoming too big? It used to be one of the few airlines I could rely on for great customer service and quality. But it seems that with the acquisition of Airtran they also acquired the bad habits of big airlines. My last trip with them was a headache that cost me $500. I got stuck in Chicago for one night and received attitude from the crew when I tried to address the issue. It is great that they don't charge for luggage but I'm curious to see how long that is going to last."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Beware more and more Southwest is just another airline. Latest casualty is the previously elegant Rapid Rewards program which used to be 16 credits=1 free flight virtually no restrictions. It has now devolved into just another points system with ever more restrictions. During the transition they are still using Awards which was the mechanism by which you reaped the reward of a free flight. But do not convert points into an award - if you do so mistakenly you will never get them converted back into points. Found this out trying to book a flight by converting to award first which was akin to the previous protocol but the flight had ""no"" award seats available. You could buy a seat with your points but after conversion to award I didn't have enough points available and Southwest has made their system physically incapable of correcting the conversion not even during this period of new learning for their customers. They make no statement that I could find that such conversions are irrevocable. In other words if you make a mistake too bad - you can pay for a ticket but Southwest won't help you correct your points v. award error and you have to wait for another flight within the coming year to use it. Yes the award expires though the points do not while you continue to generate trip activity."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","New Orleans to Las Vegas and Las Vegas to SFO. Excellent experience on both journeys friendly staff on time departures and bags free. I don't understand the benefit of open seating policy but that is the only thing I didn't like. I did however pay $10 extra for early bird-check in and got an ""A"" pass between 15-20 both times. Early-bird check in automatically checks you in 24 hours before the flight thus increasing your chances of an ""A"" boarding pass. In retrospect I would only do this for longer flights when it really does help if you can avoid that middle seat."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Travelled Southwest for the first time round trip Manchester Phoenix. Cannot understand the open seating ""gimmick"" this airline uses. On the return trip we were not able to participate in the competition to call within 24 hours and get an ""earlier"" boarding assignment as we were travelling in a remote area with no cell coverage. Therefore as we were among the last to board we (and many other couples) were not able to sit together. The flight attendants ""helped"" by continuing to instruct us to just ""find a seat single seats only available"". We ended up separated by 20 rows. The reason for this practice must have something to do with saving the airline money because there is no apparent benefit for passengers. But the on line seat selection process that all the other airlines use is obviously computerized and can't cost much if anything to oversee so why does Southwest do this?? Certainly feels like one of those brilliant ideas the management team comes up with that blindly ignores the needs of some passengers. Won't fly Southwest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","TPA-MSY. I love the fact how the first and second bag are free - and they gave us our boarding passes and took our luggage away when we were still outside. The boarding and seating was a bit crazy but managed well. The small snacks were nice and great service."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","The service is about the same you would get at a decent restaurant seats are soft snacks are tasty no entertainment but no big deal. The flight was smooth and enjoyable. When we were in Baltimore our plane got delayed by a storm in Panama city Florida. At least our bags were free!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Baltimore to Buffalo. We were very concerned about being able to deal with my mothers handicaps. From entering the airport in Baltimore to meeting our pick up in Buffalo Southwest was extremely helpful throughout the entire trip and made us very comfortable in our travel. I was very anxious about taking my mother on this trip and they truly came through for us. Thank you Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","After flying several other airlines to/from locations Southwest does not serve I am reminded how great Southwest's business model truly is. They are reliable honest easy to work with friendly and make travel less stressful. I try to fly Southwest to ensure I don't battle the stress of other airlines."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Manchester (MHT) to Norfolk (ORF) Business select. Multiple children and elderly on the flight but it was vacation week. Flight took off late landed on time. I would not pay the 225% extra for the BS fare versus the wanna get away fare due to what you receive for that increase but work takes care of it as it is for business. The free drinks are nice even on short hops form BWI to ORF in BS. Only major complaint to Southwest Airlines do not board anyone ahead of Business select class unless they pay the same fare or please place them in rows 4 and up. When you pay $230 for Business select you should board the plane before anyone else especially if they only paid ~$89 for their ticket."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Midway to Washington on very full and very cramped aircraft in cramped seats. I would not care to sit like that for more than a couple of hours. It's efficient cheap and easy to use and fine if you are of slim build."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Baltimore to Boston. As soon as my flight was cancelled during the recent blizzard the agent confirmed me on a flight leaving in 5 minutes to Providence RI while the gate agents for the Providence flight held the flight for me. The flight to Providence RI still arrived pretty much on time despite the blizzard. Southwest delivered my bags to my door the next day. Everyone was courteous from check-in to arrival. I thought this was excellent service and much better than service I have gotten on the major airlines when things go wrong. Also no fees for bags no fees for drinks and pretzels onboard and I hear there are no change fees on this airline either."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","MDW-BDL-MDW. Checkin was fast and so was boarding nice B737. FA's talkative nice low cost airline where bags fly free. Seats comfortable typical American snacks served."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Denver to San Jose and back. Did not mind grabbing whatever seat as I felt it brought out the best in most people. The staff was friendly seats were for the most part comfortable. All but the back row as those seats do not recline. The only real issue I had was that when we checked in to leave San Jose our tickets Picked up at terminal read gate 22 as well as the board. Yet some time between then and the flight the gate had changed to 23. If I had not struck up a conversation with the gentleman setting near me I would have not know until I had missed my flight. My suggestion is with your computer system you should know if a passenger has checked in before a gate change. Please make an announcement at the old gate of the change."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","MDW-MCO-MDW. Traveled with the family for a quick Disney vacation. Flight out on time and even with kids had no problem sitting together. On return we took advantage of the Southwest off airport check-in location in Lake Buena Vista so got the bags checked and boarding pass and even though the flight was delayed on the return we only had to get to the airport 45 minutes before our flight and were able to go straight to the gate."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest Airlines LGA-BWI-LGA all flights on-time. FAs very friendly and talkative free drinks is always appreciated. Free checked-in bags (2) compared to other airlines that will nickel and dime you for everything. Plane was clean boarding was fast and efficient. Wonderful airline excellent customer service from ground crew to flight crew."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","PIT-LAX Was a little leery about flying across the country with Southwest (usually use it to fly across Pennsylvania) but decided to give it a try because I absolutely refuse to pay an airline to carry a bag. I was not at all disappointed. The good service I had received on short trips was even better on the longer flight. Snacks were fine the personnel was kind (something it is difficult to say for the legacy carriers) and the seats were comfortable. I booked a flight recently to the West Coast and once again chose Southwest."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","TUL-SAT-TUL Go this route often mostly because of price but will continue to use. Day before Christmas Eve less than 48 hours after my mother passed away 6:00am flight mind in a fog I left my cell phone at the baggage check in SAT. Went through long security line sat down at the gate and realized it was missing. Told the gate agent who quickly phoned down to the baggage desk to ask if it was there - and it was! Flight boarding time running out and agent from the baggage desk RAN it down to the gate as I would have never made it back through security again. Now that's customer service."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","SAN to ELP return (through PHX). Having flown SWA for years there is great comfort in understanding the boarding process and open seating. The flight crews are professional and engaging service is well done with a selection of soft-drinks wine beer and juices and sometimes a choice of peanuts or pretzels. There is one non-stop flight each day both ways on this route and choices of flights to SAN through LAS and occasionally ALB. SWA is reliable and accommodating with a simple and straightforward business model."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","DEN-LAS return. Bags do fly free. Online check in is fine. Bag drop at Denver fast enough for those checked-in. Swift flight down. Soft drinks & peanuts handed out. OK in flight magazine. Uneventful. Return journey was terrible. 6am flight. Checked in OK but no staff appeared until 4.45am by which time a massive queue had formed. We hardly had time to get a snack before boarding but then had to wait on the plane for other late folk. Laughable. I can see where they save money: reduce staffing. Arrived in Denver OK but really it is quite a flimsy airline as the service in Las Vegas shows."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","San Jose (SJC) to Santa Ana (SNA) return. For both flights checking in on-line 24 hours before each flight got me an ""A25"" or better boarding pass and on both flights I was able to get a window seat on the over-wing emergency exit row with lots of leg room. On the flight to SNA the flight attendant spent quite a bit of time going over the emergency exit procedures which I think was a great example of how this airline can be both professional (take care of serious business) and laid back (announcements are usually quite funny and entertaining!). Soft drinks and peanuts served on these 1-hour flights and two suitcases checked in free."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My teenage daughters and I flew SouthWest San Diego - Vegas return. We found them to be brilliant and far better than their European equivalents - easyjet and Ryanair. We checked in online as soon as the 24 hour window opened boarded amongst the first passengers - thus avoiding the scramble and able to sit together. The boarding process is far smoother than in Europe and although the flight was only an hour long we were served complimentary soft drinks and peanuts/pretzels. The outward flight was on time and return delayed 20 mins or so. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly and safety announcements were light hearted and funny but got the message across - we probably paid more attention to these humorous announcements than we would have to the regular dry offerings. The flights (pre booked in September) were good value and we would have no hesitation in flying SouthWest again."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Southwest is at best a fair weather friend. My latest trip has been an epic debacle with poor customer relations shoddy baggage handling and a consistent and frustrating choice by this airline to make no effort whatsoever to get me home. Flying Southwest is like driving a car without insurance - ok until something goes wrong. And when something does go wrong Southwest will do nothing to make it right unlike better airlines. Customer loyalty means nothing to this airline as well."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","DEN-SLC very late booking less than 12 hours before flight left a good fare and no hassle. Flight was full but crew provided service with a smile. If you follow their booking system you cannot fault them at all. Compared to legacy carriers within the US Southwest are the best."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My husband has been unemployed a while and we were wondering how we were going to get my daughter a plane ticket to come home for Christmas. Southwest Airlines have really fair prices their website is customer friendly. When we found my daughter's situation had changed and she would be able to come home earlier it was very easy to change her flight online - and Southwest didn't charge a big fee to change the ticket. Only a few dollars that was the higher price of the new ticket."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","As a young inexperienced traveler I relied on our travel agent to recommend the best airline for our honeymoon. She recommended Southwest as the best. We book at a reasonable rate for the holiday season as soon as tickets became available. Everything was good to go until we got our tickets with no seat number. We ended up being one of the last people on the plane with only a few middle seat left scattered across the plane when we got on. Then we saw an open pair together only to be rudely told by a stewardess that they were reserved in case another family boarded. I politely said how about a new family we just got married. She rudely said no find a seat and turned around. Luckily a kind man gave us his seat so we could sit together but the rest of the trip we full of rude comments from the stewardess about how she couldn't believe he moved!"
"Southwest Airlines customer review","We were forced to change our scheduled departure from New Orleans because my partner became seriously ill. We departed New Orleans three days early. We paid $200.00 in additional fees for the flight rescheduling which to me was acceptable by today's rules. I asked Southwest for a refund of the Early Bird Seating fee ($20.00) sending them the hospital and rescheduling documentation. Southwest called and said they would refund $200.00 because of the medical emergency - said they did not believe in taking advantage of their customers. I have always found Southwest Airlines to be fair honest and customer friendly which is why I stay with them."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","My original ticket from Palm Beach Florida to Denver Colorado was screwed up through American Airlines. They wanted to charge me $900 to fix it. I was trying to figure out something to do and ended up talked to agents at SWA and without a thought they started working the problem for me. By the end of the it I had a ticket for $400 and was set to go! They took care of everything and I was on my way before I knew what to do."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","More and more disenchanted with Southwest. Used them three times this summer and the experience got worse each time. Southwest check in and other representatives rude. No wonder the bags fly free Southwest has no intention of taking reasonable care with them. Now we have discovered that they make you sign a waiver saying that they aren't responsible if your golf clubs don't arrive at your destination or if they are damaged in transit. Also on our last two flights the attendants made the safety briefing into a real joke and didn't even complete it properly. It is nice to try to make flying fun but I think that they are crossing the line. Not all customers are frequent flyers who are familiar with the safety aspects of a plane. They used to be my favorite airline but not anymore. They are not always the least expensive and definitely lack customer service."
"Southwest Airlines customer review","Phoenix to Detroit. Very good service. Had a toddler travelling with us and check-in was super efficient. It took less than five minutes and we were off with our boarding passes. I travel Southwest at least once a month and I will continue to travel with them even if their prices increase."
